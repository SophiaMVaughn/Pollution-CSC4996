John Flesher The Associated PressCaptionCloseCROSSROADS, N.M. >> Carl Johnson and son Justin are third- and fourth-generation ranchers who for decades have battled oilfield companies that left a patchwork of barren earth where the men graze cattle in the high plains of New Mexico. Blunt and profane, they stroll across a 1½-acre patch of sandy soil — lifeless, save for a scattering of stunted weeds.Five years ago, a broken pipe soaked the land with as much as 420,000 gallons of oilfield wastewater — a salty and potentially toxic drilling byproduct that can quickly turn fertile land into a dead zone. The leaked brine killed every sprig of grama and bluestem grasses and shinnery shrubs it touched.For the Johnsons, the spill is among dozens that have taken a heavy toll: a landscape pockmarked with spots where livestock can no longer graze, legal fees running into the tens of thousands and worries about the safety of the area’s underground aquifer.“If we lose our water, that ruins our ranch,” Justin Johnson said. “That’s the end of the story.”Their plight illustrates a largely overlooked side effect of oil and gas production that has worsened with the past decade’s drilling boom: spills of wastewater that foul the land, kill wildlife and threaten freshwater supplies.An Associated Press analysis of data from leading oil- and gas-producing states found more than 175 million gallons of wastewater spilled from 2009 to 2014 in incidents involving ruptured pipes, overflowing storage tanks and other mishaps or even deliberate dumping. There were some 21,651 individual spills. And these numbers are incomplete because many releases go unreported.Though oil spills tend to get more attention, wastewater spills can be more damaging. And in seven of the 11 states the AP examined, the amount of wastewater released was at least twice that of oil discharged.Spilled oil, however unsightly, over time is absorbed by minerals in the soil or degraded by microbes. Not so with the wastewater, also known as brine, produced water or saltwater. Unless thoroughly cleansed, a costly and time-consuming process, salt-saturated land dries up. Trees die. Crops cannot take root.“Oil spills may look bad, but we know how to clean them up and ... return the land to a productive state,” said Kerry Sublette, a University of Tulsa environmental engineer and specialist in treating the despoiled landscapes. “Brine spills are much more difficult.”In addition to the extreme salinity, the fluids often contain heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury, plus radioactivity. Even smaller discharges affecting an acre or two gradually add up for landowners — “death by a thousand bee stings,” said Don Shriber of Farmington, New Mexico, a cattleman who wrangled with an oil company over damage.For animals, the results can be fatal. Ranchers, including Melvin Reed of Shidler, Oklahoma, said they have lost cattle that lapped up the liquids or ate tainted grass.“They get real thin. It messes them up,” Reed said. “Sometimes you just have to shoot them.”The AP obtained data from regulatory agencies in Texas, North Dakota, California, Alaska, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Kansas, Utah and Montana — states that account for more than 90 percent of the nation’s onshore oil production. Officials in ninth-ranking oil producer Louisiana and second-ranking gas producer Pennsylvania said they could not provide comprehensive spill data.The spill total increased each year, along with oil and gas production. In 2009, there were 2,470 reported spills in the 11 states; by 2014, the total was 4,643. The amount of wastewater spilled doubled from 21.1 million gallons in 2009 to 43 million in 2013 before dipping to 33.5 million last year.The extent of land or water contamination is unknown; state and federal regulators make no such assessments. Texas, the nation’s biggest oil and gas producer, had the most incidents, 4,783, and the highest volume spilled, 62 million gallons.Industry groups and regulators said much of the waste is recovered during cleanup operations or contained by berms near wells. Still, they acknowledged a certain amount soaks into the ground and can flow into waterways.“You’re going to have spills in an industrial society,” said Katie Brown, spokeswoman for Energy In Depth, a research and education arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. “But there are programs in place to reduce them.”Wastewater spills have dogged the oil industry from its earliest days more than a century ago, borne witness by barren sites from the Great Plains to the Pacific. A notorious symbol is the “Texon scar,” where brine from a well drilled in 1923 near that tiny West Texas town created a desolate 2,000-acre swath dotted with dead mesquite trees. Efforts to restore the land continue to this day, said range conservationist Joe Petersen.Concentrated brine, much saltier than seawater, exists naturally in rock formations thousands of feet underground, a remnant of prehistoric oceans. When oil and gas are pumped to the surface, the water comes too, along with fluids and chemicals injected to crack open rock — the process known as hydraulic fracturing. Production of methane gas from coal deposits also generates wastewater, but it is less salty and harmful.The spills usually occur as oil and gas are channeled to metal tanks for separation from the wastewater, and the water is delivered to a disposal site — usually an injection well that pumps it back underground. Pipelines, tank trucks and pits are potential weak points.Accidents range from the mundane to the freakish; in 2010, a storage tank near Ardmore, Oklahoma, overflowed after a snake slithered into a panel box and blew a fuse. Most spills are caused by equipment malfunction or human error, according to state reports reviewed by the AP.Though no full accounting of damage exists, the scope is sketched out in a sampling of incidents:• In North Dakota, a spill of nearly 1 million gallons in 2006 caused a massive die-off of fish, turtles and plants in the Yellowstone River and a tributary. Cleanup costs approached $2 million. Two larger spills since then scoured vegetation along an almost 2-mile stretch and fouled a creek and a river.• Wastewater from unlined pits seeped beneath a 6,000-acre cotton and nut farm near Bakersfield, California, and contaminated groundwater. Oil giant Aera Energy was ordered in 2009 to pay $9 million to grower Fred Starrh, who had to remove 2,000 acres from production.• Brine leaks exceeding 40 million gallons over decades on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana polluted a river, private wells and the municipal water system in Poplar. “It was undrinkable,” said resident Donna Whitmer. “If you shook it up, it’d look all orange.” Under a 2012 settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, oil companies paid $320,000 for new water wells and other improvements. Drinking water tainted with oilfield brine can cause high blood pressure, dehydration and other health risks, EPA spokeswoman Sarah Teschner said.• In Fort Stockton, Texas, officials in February accused oil company Bugington Energy of illegally dumping 3 million gallons of wastewater in pastures. Paul Weatherby, general manager of the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District, said he fears contamination of the area’s groundwater table. The district levied a $130,000 fine but the company hasn’t paid, contending the district overstepped its authority.• A pipeline joint failure caused flooding on Don Stoker’s ranch near Snyder, Texas, in November 2012 and turned his hackberry shade trees into skeletons. Vacuum trucks sucked up some saltwater and the oil company paid damages, but Stoker said his operation was in turmoil. “I had to stay out there three days and watch them while they were getting the saltwater out, to make sure they didn’t totally destroy the whole area.”Government agencies acknowledge having a limited view of the accidents, which often happen in remote places and, unlike oil spills, don’t produce dramatic images of birds flailing in black goo and tourist beaches fouled. Regulators rely on private operators to notify them, and it’s not always required. For example, Oklahoma exempts reporting of most spills of less than 10 barrels, or 420 gallons.The loudest whistleblowers are often property owners, who must allow drilling access to their land if they don’t own the mineral rights.“Most ranchers are very attached to the land,” said Jeff Henry, president of the Osage County Cattlemen’s Association in Oklahoma. “It’s where we derive our income, raise our families. It’s who we are.”A big reason why there are so many spills is the sheer volume of wastewater extracted: about 10 barrels for every barrel of oil, according to an organization of state ground water agencies, or more than 840 billion gallons a year.Sometimes, the exact cause is never determined. The Johnsons have yet to learn why an underground line ruptured in at least two places on the state-owned land they lease for ranching. A salty, oily odor wafted heavily on the breeze when Justin Johnson reached the site in October 2010.“I was just totally and thoroughly disgusted,” he said.New Mexico Salt Water Disposal Co. acknowledged responsibility. No fines were levied because the leak was accidental. Vice President Rory McGinn blamed practices and materials the company no longer uses, saying in an interview that “an enormous amount of money” has gone into upgrades.The company said much the same in 2005 after earlier spills, telling the state in a letter obtained through a records request it had spent nearly $250,000 on higher-grade pipe, tanks and valves and “our objective and goal is to be 100 percent maintenance and environmentally safe in our operation.”The company has had a dozen spills since 2003, said Larry Behrens of the New Mexico Department of Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources.Despite such incidents, relatively few farmers and ranchers complain publicly. Some get royalty checks for wells on their property. Others don’t want to be seen as opposing an industry that is the economic backbone of their communities.“If they treat us right, we’re all friends of oil,” said Mike Artz, a grower in North Dakota’s Bottineau County who lost a five-acre barley crop in 2013 after a saltwater pipeline rupture. “But right now, it’s just a horse running without the bridle.”Oil and gas developers said they have everything to gain from stopping spills, which cost them money for cleanup and soil restoration.Sara Hughes, spokeswoman for pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, said her company has lowered water injection pressure and installed additional leak-detection devices on its lines since its spill on Stoker’s land.“We are committed to public safety, protection of the environment and operation of our facilities in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations,” Hughes said.In North Dakota, where the spills increased at a higher rate than the well count during the boom years of 2009-’14, pipelines near waterways must have leak prevention devices but not those elsewhere; critics said that shows the oil industry’s political clout. Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, said more devices would be costly and wouldn’t necessarily catch small leaks.Tessa Sandstrom, of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said the industry is cooperating with scientists studying prevention and land restoration. When spills do happen, she said, most are cleaned up within a year.But Bottineau County grain farmer Daryl Peterson said it took years of prodding before regulators ordered an oil company to dig up 300 truckloads of tainted soil on his property and replace it. The soil is still salty, he said.Sublette, the University of Tulsa engineer, said soil excavation and replacement is unreliable because some operators “bring in the nastiest stuff they can find.” He recommends extensive flushing with fresh water to remove salts from the zone where plants take root, then rebuilding the soil with nurturing additives. Even done correctly, it can take years to get plants growing again.Similar methods were used on the Johnsons’ pastures, but father and son said the land has not come back to life.“It will never, ever be like it was,” Justin Johnson said, giving a bleached-white stone a desultory kick. “It will never fully recover.”

GILLIAN FLACCUS Associated PressTHERMAL, Calif. -- Community activists in Southern California's Coachella Valley have been toiling for years along the eastern rim of this crescent-shaped breadbasket to spread the word about the abandoned waste dumps, shoddy migrant housing and overburdened recycling facilities that are a fact of life in this poor, farmworker community.Their work paid off last month, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state regulators cracked down on a soil recycling plant that was blamed by air quality officials for a putrid stench that sickened dozens of children and teachers at a nearby school.Now, the groups are taking advantage of that national spotlight -- including a visit from U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer -- to press for similar action at other toxic sites that dot the remote valley, from an abandoned and illegal dump to a mountain of human sewage that locals dubbed Mt. San Diego because it was trucked in from San Diego County.Activists will take state lawmakers and state and federal regulatory officials on an "environmental justice" bus tour Friday with stops at a laundry list of sites that represent potential environmental hazards. It's the second such tour the group has organized this year since forming an environmental task force that includes officials from all levels of government, with the goal of improving living conditions in the sun-baked Coachella Valley.The tour on Friday precedes a state legislative committee hearing on environmental safety and toxins that will be held at the local high school here.The federal crackdown on soil recycler Western Environmental, Inc., which sits on tribal land, was the first major success after a coalition of civil rights and migrant advocacy groups began using an evolving strategy, said Megan Beaman, an attorney with California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc. The group used to try to make its point by filing lawsuits against major polluters or negligent landlords but recently realized that's not enough, she said."We need a lot more people at the table and a lot more resources," she said. "We are looking at this as an opportunity to create a model of enforcement ... that will carry on to other places in our community and around the state."The valley roughly 130 miles southeast of Los Angeles is well-known for the glitzier cities such as Palm Springs and Palm Desert that sit on its western edge, but dusty towns to the east like Mecca, Thermal and Indio skirt the northern tip of the Salton Sea and seem a world away from the fairways and swimming pools of their neighbors. Farmworkers, many of them migrants, toil in the agricultural fields that define this heavily irrigated region and come home to dangerously overcrowded trailer parks with limited septic systems and jerry-rigged electrical systems.Recycling plants, dumps and other businesses unwelcome in more metropolitan areas set up shop years ago in the eastern valley and continue to present health hazards.In March, the newly formed environmental task force ramped up an online site where residents can log in and document environmental hazards in their community, including unexplained fumes and pollution, said Beaman, whose group is one of the main organizations working in the valley.Both the so-called "toxic tours" and the online site are ideas borrowed from the nearby Imperial Valley, where poor and mostly migrant residents deal with similar issues, she said. The online log of residents' complaints has been used there to identify safety issues previously unknown to regulators, organizers say, and they hope it will have the same effect in the Coachella Valley.Darryl Adams, the interim superintendent of the Coachella Valley Unified School District, moved to the region a year ago and took the first bus tour that activists offered earlier this year. He signed up after students at one of his elementary schools in Mecca were sickened by fumes that were later traced to Western Environmental, whose facilities are visible from the school's playground.Adams said he was stunned by the things he saw on the tour, especially the living conditions in the migrant encampments."I could not believe what I saw and ever since that day it's been my purpose in life ... to eventually do something about those living conditions," he said. "Why is the eastern Coachella Valley being seen as a dump site or a recycling place when you have people in homes and the agricultural industry out here? Why isn't something being done out here?'"The EPA issued an order last month that temporarily shut down Western Environmental after dozens of children at the school got sick from a "rotten egg" smell that had drifted across the community on and off for months. The order temporarily bans Western from accepting new shipments of soil contaminated with petroleum and other hazardous substances and instructed the company to reduce and cover 40-foot-tall piles of dirt that lined the property it leases from the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians.Western, which has taken steps to address the order, has challenged the findings of regulators who traced the stench to its operations. It is working with regulators to reopen.It was to be one of about a half-dozen sites visited by the environmental tour planned by community activists.Other likely stops include a tire recycling facility where a fire broke out last month; the human sewage pile; an abandoned dump on land owned by the Torres Martinez Band of Mission Indians and a migrant housing camp.

Fire crews extinguished the blaze atA roughly seven-mile stretch of the Houston Ship Channel has been closed due to contaminants spilling out of the Intercontinental Terminals Co. in Deer Park.The Ship Channel closure starts at Tucker Bayou, where ITC is located, and goes out toward Galveston Bay. The Lynchburg Ferry is located roughly in the middle of this closed portion, according to the U.S. Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Services.There is no way around the closed portion, meaning ships at the most inland part of the ship channel, known as the Turning Basin, will remain there until it reopens. Ships destined for the Turning Basin and other more inland destinations will likewise be halted.The latest on ITC: Wall surrounding tank farm at charred Deer Park plant breachesThere were 54 vessels in transit when the order was given to close the ship channel. Around 2:15 p.m., there were 41 vessels in transit outside the affected area. The 13 vessels not moving would be a fair estimate of ships immediately affected, according to the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Services.The Coast Guard did not know how long the Ship Channel would be closed.According to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the dike surrounding the ITC chemical storage tanks damaged by this week's fire had been breached. Booms had been put in place, and there's action being taken to contain runoff from the breach with additional booms.ITC's contractor, at the direction of TCEQ, and the Coast Guard are skimming and pumping contaminated runoff into storage containers. The Port Houston Fire Department is also assisting with response.

By David Hunn, Houston ChronicleCaptionCloseOil and gas drilling in Texas shale plays pollutes the air, erodes soil and contaminates water, while the disposal of millions of gallons of wastewater causes earthquakes, a consortium of the state’s top scientists concluded. In the most comprehensive analysis of the environmental and social impacts of drilling and hydraulic fracturing, the Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas found that the shale oil boom that delivered so much prosperity to Texas also has degraded natural resources, overwhelmed small communities, and even boosted the frequency and severity of traffic collisions as workers and equipment rush to oil fields. Fracking, which uses a high-pressured concoction of water, sand and chemicals to free oil and gas from dense shale rock, is also spreading rapidly across Texas, the study noted. Some companies are even leasing mineral rights under Texas cities. “We’re seeing these activities in places we haven’t seen before. And we’re seeing them at an increasing scale, pace and intensity,” said Marilu Hastings, vice president of sustainability programs for the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation, which funded a portion of the research. Texans are asking reasonable questions, she said: “Is it safe? Are my children safe? Is my water safe? What about the environment? What about my land?” The analysis is likely to increase the scrutiny of fracking, particularly as a second shale boom gets underway in the Permian Basin in West Texas and other shale plays in the state. No one, including the scientists who conducted the study, expect oil and gas companies to slow production. But the report may boost pressure on the firms to drill more carefully, keep operations out of populated areas, and consider more environmentally friendly fracking technologies.Houston’s Apache Corp., for instance, is experimenting with a large-scale water recycling program in West Texas, where it has come under significant scrutiny as it develops a new oil field near Balmorhea State Park and local springs that provide water for farming, drinking supplies and the park’s famous pool. The Texas  Parks & Wildlife Department, meanwhile, has launched an unprecedented study of wildlife, plants and water nearby to monitor the environmental impact of Apache’s project.Hydraulic fracturing remains controversial, across the country and around the world. States like Maryland, New York and Vermont have banned the practice, as have countries like France, Germany and Scotland. Counties in California, New Mexico and Colorado, among others, have tried with some success. Even Denton, a North Texas city of about 130,00, adopted a fracking ban before the Texas  Legislature passed a law to prevent it. “There’s significant debate in the public about shale development,” said Kris Nygaard, an Exxon Mobil consultant who participated in the Texas study. “And I think we can all agree the most healthy and informative debates surround real data, hard facts, hard information.”The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas is the state’s top scientific community. It includes all of the state’s Nobel  laureates, plus Texas-based members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.It launched its fracking review two years ago, putting together a task force of attorneys, geologists, seismologists and engineers, including representatives from oil companies and an environmental group.The group’s conclusions are based on the review and analysis of hundreds of academic studies, many involving Texas oil and gas operations. The report noted that the state has no single database tracking environmental impacts, no system for conducting regular research on plants and animals affected, and little detail on wastewater spills from shale drilling and fracking. There is also limited data concerning exposure to toxins in the air. The report calls for the state to do better in monitoring and collecting data. In addition to highlighting concerns, the report also aimed to correct misstatements and misunderstandings about shale drilling. For example, surface spills, not fracking, are the most likely drinking water contaminants, the study found. Oil reservoirs are typically so much deeper than freshwater aquifers that contamination between the two is “unlikely,” the report said, “and it has not been observed in Texas.” And the study found little evidence to connect shale oil production emissions to health effects, adding  there isn’t much research on the issue. “There are a lot of people who are afraid of hydraulic fracturing,” said University of Houston professor and former Schlumberger petroleum engineer Christine Ehlig-Economides, who chaired the task force. “Hopefully, we have clarified what are not concerns.”But the 204-page report still found a litany of worries about fracking and suggested a bevy of new research.Specifically: Scientists need to better track baseline land and habitat conditions near oil and gas fields, the report said, and record changes to wildlife and vegetation over time.  Landowners in Texas who do not own the mineral rights on their land have little control over oil and gas operations. Most states with shale resources have a surface damage act to protect landowners; Texas should consider one. Data on wastewater spills and leaks are less accessible and detailed than in other states. Texas should improve requirements to identify sources and responses. “I’m a seismologist,” said Brian Stump, a professor at Southern Methodist University and member of the task force. “But this shale gas development is critically important to a state like Texas because of its economy, and important internationally because of its energy resources. Understanding the good and bad implications helps us know what’s right and what to improve.”David.hunn@chron.com

By Jennifer HillerCaptionCloseA study of water wells in the Eagle Ford Shale oil field in South Texas showed evidence of contamination from industrial or agricultural activities. The study, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, found instances of bubbly water that indicated dissolved gas was present. It also found abnormal chloride/bromide ratios — an indication of contamination — and volatile organic compounds, known as VOCs.Shale oil production is the biggest industry in the area, but it isn’t the only one, the study noted. There’s also poultry, cattle and grass production.Scientists took samples from 77 private water wells in Atascoca, DeWitt, Gonzales, Karnes and Wilson counties, some as shallow as 70 feet; others as deep as 2,800 feet. The wells tapped the Carrizo-Wilcox, Yegua-Jackson and Gulf Coast aquifers, which form a “leaky artesian aquifer system” in the region. The takeaway, Hildenbrand said, was that not all of the contamination is coming from human activity — there’s also naturally occurring contamination, “namely arsenic.” The arsenic may be coming from a layer of volcanic ash, the study said.For more on this report, go to ExpressNews.com or Tuesday’s Business section.jhiller@express-news.netTwitter: @Jennifer_Hiller

Matthew Brown, Associated PressHurricane Harvey's floodwaters triggered a spill of almost a half-million gallons of gasoline from two storage tanks along the Houston Ship Channel, marking the largest spill reported to date from a storm that slammed into the heart of Texas' huge petrochemical industry.The spill measured 10,988 barrels, or more than 461,000 gallons, and occurred at a petroleum tank farm in Galena Park operated by Magellan Midstream Partners, according to the Oklahoma-based company and accident reports submitted to federal officials.Some of the spilled fuel flowed into a waterway adjacent to the ship channel, a heavily-industrialized area that's lined with dozens of petrochemical facilities, the reports said.Gasoline is more volatile than oil, meaning it evaporates more quickly after it's spilled. But it's also more likely to catch fire than oil and can more rapidly penetrate the soil and potentially contaminate groundwater supplies.Magellan spokesman Bruce Heine said the gasoline that reached the small, unnamed waterway had been contained. The spilled fuel was sprayed with foam to prevent it from releasing harmful vapors, he said."Federal and state regulators have been on-site during the recovery and clean-up procedures," Heine said. "Clean-up activities at the facility are continuing and we are currently removing and replacing affected soil."The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency were unable to immediately answer questions about possible health effects and environmental contamination from the spill.CEQ spokeswoman Andrea Morrow said the agency will investigate the accident to determine if Magellan had complied with its operating permit and state rules that require the company to disclose any air pollution emitted by the spilled gasoline.The spill was first reported to state and federal officials on Aug. 31, but no volume was given at that time. The company next reported the spill was 1,000 barrels. In a report filed last week and released Monday, Magellan put the spill 10 times higher at 10,988 barrels.Heine said state and federal regulators had been notified promptly of the company's best assessments of the volume.The Associated Press has identified more than two dozen spills from fuel and chemical tanks that failed during Harvey. At least 14 tanks failed when their roofs sank under the weight of Harvey's unprecedented rainfall. Others were swept away by floodwaters.Including the Magellan spill, the accidents combined have released more than 600,000 gallons of fuel.Heine said what happened with Magellan's tanks was "related to flooding associated with the hurricane," but did not elaborate.Government regulations do not require tank owners to take specific steps to make the tanks flood resistant, although researchers have warned for years that they are prone to break open during severe hurricanes such as Hurricane Katrina, which caused several major storage tank spills.

The ground around the tanks is also saturated in dangerous fluids, severely restricting access to the facility 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of downtown Houston. On Friday, the company said they may be able to allow some access early this week.ITC and its top executive, Bernt Netland, have been chastised by elected officials for their handling of the unfolding disaster that cast a mile-high plume of black smoke over the fourth-largest American city for days, paralyzed its eastern suburbs and severed Houston’s waterborne access to the Gulf of Mexico. Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen’s probe of the event has so far been restricted to off-site interviews.“We haven’t been able to gain access to the site yet,” said Rachel Moreno, a spokeswoman for the fire marshal. “They’re still doing emergency operations and we need to wait until it’s safe for the investigators to go in.”Benzene eruptionsChristensen’s investigators won’t enter the site until the remaining tanks are emptied and other hazards have been mitigated, Moreno said. Clouds of cancer-causing benzene have continued to waft over the disaster site as well as nearby factories and suburbs, including one early Friday, according to ITC.Oil tankers and other ships headed for the manufacturing nexus along the Houston Ship Channel have been backing up in Galveston Bay and the Gulf because of runoff from ITC’s facility that polluted the waterway. The U.S. Coast Guard commander for the region said he doesn’t know when things may return to normal.Almost 20 miles of rubber barriers have been deployed to halt the spread of the oily sheen and protect oyster beds. Ferry service in the area remains shut down and the annual re-enactment of the 1836 Battle of San Jacinto that won Texas independence from Mexico has been canceled.ITC, a unit of Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co., may be facing billions of dollars in damages, penalties and clean-up costs. Every day the ship channel is closed erases $300 million from the local economy, Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia said. And that doesn’t take into account what ITC may owe the companies whose chemicals were burned and lost in the fire and subsequent spill.Owners notifiedBrent Weber, the senior vice president of sales and marketing who’s become the face of ITC’s response, declined to identify the owners of the chemicals, byproducts of the oil-refining process.“ITC is a storage terminal only so out of respect for our customers’ confidentiality we do not release that information, but, yes, the customers of that product have been notified and we’ve been in constant contact with all of our customers,” Weber said on Friday.Other entities investigating the incident include the U.S. Chemical Safety Board and the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued the company for violating air-pollution laws.Lawmakers may also take ITC leaders to task. State Senator Carol Alvarado wants the company hauled before the Select Committee on Texas Ports that she vice-chairs.“I’m sure that because of this incident, it’s causing people to pause and maybe rethink some of the infrastructure around” the region, Alvarado said. “Who would have thought that this fire would have caused this ripple effect that is impacting potentially the global market?”--With assistance from Rachel Adams-Heard, David Wethe, Ryan Collins and Ben Foldy.

KEVIN BEGOS | Associated PressIn at least four states that have nurtured the nation's energy boom, hundreds of complaints have been made about well-water contamination from oil or gas drilling.Pollution was confirmed in a number of them, according to a review that casts doubt on industry suggestions that such problems rarely happen.The Associated Press requested data on drilling-related complaints in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Texas and found major differences in how the states report such problems. Texas provided the most detail, while the other states provided only general outlines. And while the confirmed problems represent only a tiny portion of the thousands of oil and gas wells drilled each year in the U.S., the lack of detail in some state reports could help fuel public confusion and mistrust.The AP found that Pennsylvania received 398 complaints in 2013 alleging that oil or natural gas drilling polluted or otherwise affected private water wells, compared with 499 in 2012. The Pennsylvania complaints can include allegations of short-term diminished water flow, as well as pollution from stray gas or other substances. More than 100 cases of pollution were confirmed over the past five years.Just hearing the total number of complaints shocked Heather McMicken, an eastern Pennsylvania homeowner who complained about water-well contamination that state officials eventually confirmed."Wow, I'm very surprised," said McMicken, recalling that she and her husband never knew how many other people made similar complaints, since the main source of information "was just through the grapevine."The McMickens were one of three families that eventually reached a $1.6 million settlement with a drilling company. Heather McMicken said the state should be forthcoming with details.Over the past 10 years, hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has led to a boom in oil and natural gas production around the nation. It has reduced imports and led to hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for companies and landowners, but also created pollution fears.Extracting fuel from shale formations requires pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into the ground to break apart rock and free the gas. Some of that water, along with large quantities of existing underground water, returns to the surface, and it can contain high levels of salt, drilling chemicals, heavy metals and naturally occurring low-level radiation.But some conventional oil and gas wells are still drilled, so the complaints about water contamination can come from them, too. Experts say the most common type of pollution involves methane, not chemicals from the drilling process.Some people who rely on well water near drilling operations have complained about pollution, but there's been considerable confusion over how widespread such problems are. For example, starting in 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection aggressively fought efforts by the AP and other news organizations to obtain information about complaints related to drilling. The department has argued in court filings that it does not count how many contamination "determination letters" it issues or track where they are kept in its files.Steve Forde, a spokesman for the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the leading industry group in Pennsylvania, said in a statement that "transparency and making data available to the public is critical to getting this historic opportunity right and maintaining the public's trust."When the state Environmental Department determines natural gas development has caused problems, Forde said, "our member companies work collaboratively with the homeowner and regulators to find a speedy resolution."Among the findings in the AP's review:— Pennsylvania has confirmed at least 106 water-well contamination cases since 2005, out of more than 5,000 new wells. There were five confirmed cases of water-well contamination in the first nine months of 2012, 18 in all of 2011 and 29 in 2010. The Environmental Department said more complete data may be available in several months.— Ohio had 37 complaints in 2010 and no confirmed contamination of water supplies; 54 complaints in 2011 and two confirmed cases of contamination; 59 complaints in 2012 and two confirmed contaminations; and 40 complaints for the first 11 months of 2013, with two confirmed contaminations and 14 still under investigation, Department of Natural Resources spokesman Mark Bruce said in an email. None of the six confirmed cases of contamination was related to fracking, Bruce said.— West Virginia has had about 122 complaints that drilling contaminated water wells over the past four years, and in four cases the evidence was strong enough that the driller agreed to take corrective action, officials said.— A Texas spreadsheet contains more than 2,000 complaints, and 62 of those allege possible well-water contamination from oil and gas activity, said Ramona Nye, a spokeswoman for the Railroad Commission of Texas, which oversees drilling. Texas regulators haven't confirmed a single case of drilling-related water-well contamination in the past 10 years, she said.In Pennsylvania, the number of confirmed instances of water pollution in the eastern part of the state "dropped quite substantially" in 2013, compared with previous years, Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman Lisa Kasianowitz wrote in an email. Two instances of drilling affecting water wells were confirmed there last year, she said, and a final decision hasn't been made in three other cases. But she couldn't say how many of the other statewide complaints have been resolved or were found to be from natural causes.Releasing comprehensive information about gas drilling problems is important because the debate is no longer about just science but trust, said Irina Feygina, a social psychologist who studies environmental policy issues. Losing public trust is "a surefire way to harm" the reputation of any business, Feygina said.Experts and regulators agree that investigating complaints of water-well contamination is particularly difficult, in part because some regions also have natural methane gas pollution or other problems unrelated to drilling. A 2011 Penn State study found that about 40 percent of water wells tested prior to gas drilling failed at least one federal drinking water standard. Pennsylvania is one of only a few states that don't have private water-well construction standards.But other experts say people who are trying to understand the benefits and harms from the drilling boom need comprehensive details about complaints, even if some cases are from natural causes.In Pennsylvania, the raw number of complaints "doesn't tell you anything," said Rob Jackson, a Duke University scientist who has studied gas drilling and water contamination issues. Jackson said he doesn't think providing more details is asking for too much."Right or wrong, many people in the public feel like DEP is stonewalling some of these investigations," Jackson said of the situation in Pennsylvania.In contrast with the limited information provided by Pennsylvania, Texas officials supplied a detailed 94-page spreadsheet almost immediately, listing all types of oil and gas related complaints over much of the past two years. The Texas data include the date of the complaint, the landowner, the drilling company and a brief summary of the alleged problems. Many complaints involve other issues, such as odors or abandoned equipment.Scott Anderson, an expert on oil and gas drilling with the Environmental Defense Fund, a national nonprofit based in Austin, notes that Texas regulators started keeping more data on complaints in the 1980s. New legislation in 2011 and 2013 led to more detailed reports and provided funds for a new information technology system, he said.Anderson agreed that a lack of transparency fuels mistrust."If the industry has nothing to hide, then they should be willing to let the facts speaks for themselves," he said. "The same goes for regulatory agencies."

By Jennifer Hiller, Staff WriterValero Energy Corp.'s Corpus Christi West refinery.Valero Energy Corp.'s Corpus Christi West refinery.CaptionCloseValero Energy Corp.'s Corpus Christi West refinery.Valero Energy Corp.'s Corpus Christi West refinery.A Corpus Christi attorney filed a lawsuit Thursday against Valero Energy Corp.’s refinery there less than 24 hours after the city issued a warning to its 320,000 residents telling them not to drink or shower with the water because it may have been contaminated in an industrial “back-flow incident.”The suit was filed in Nueces County on behalf of local businesses, including Anthony’s Aveda Concept Salon, which had to close because of the lack of water. The plaintiffs are seeking more than $1 million in damages.“This case demonstrates the human and societal suffering caused when the drive for corporate profits takes priority over the safety of ordinary people,” attorney Bob Hilliard, who filed the case, said in a statement. He’s also suing Valero Marketing and Supply Co., Valero South Texas Marketing Co., the Valero Bill Greehey Plant in Corpus Christi and Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions Inc.Valero spokeswoman Lillian Riojas said the company doesn’t believe that its refineries in Corpus Christi caused the problem or that the local water supply was actually contaminated. The company hasn’t responded to questions about the incident, but issued this statement:“At this time, we believe this is a localized backflow issue from third party operations in the area of Valero’s asphalt terminal … We believe this issue is isolated to a lateral industrial line. Valero is offering its resources to assist the city in isolating the issue and to help confirm this has not impacted the city’s water supply.”The Corpus Christi legislative delegation released a statement saying two chemicals may have been released into the public water system, according to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.The city previously identified Indulin AA-86, an emulsifying agent for asphalt, as the main hazard. It’s an amber liquid considered hazardous by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and can cause eye and skin burns and severe respiratory tract irritation, according to the chemical Material Safety Data Sheet.Valero Energy, the nation’s largest refiner, has two plants at its Bill Greehey refineries complex in Corpus Christi. The plants have a combined capacity of 325,000 barrels per day and are located along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. The city’s industrial district is located north of Interstate 37 near downtown and along Nueces Bay.The Port of Corpus Christi said it was complying with the notice to discontinue the use of tap water and is in touch with customers, but has other water sources available.“Port Corpus Christi continues to notify customers who may be using the Port facilities of the ban and will continue to keep customers aware and updated on the situation as we know more,” the port said in a statement Thursday afternoon. “Port Corpus Christi has water supply from other sources including San Patricio Water District which is not affected by the ban. Port Corpus Christi will continue its diligence on keeping customers current on the situation and supporting maritime operations as needed.”A spokesman with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which regulates the industry, said the agency expects to issue a statement about Corpus Christi. jhiller@express-news.net Twitter: @Jennifer_Hiller jhiller@express-news.netTwitter: @Jennifer_Hiller

By Ryan Handy, Houston ChronicleThe Railroad Commission of Texas fined an oil and gas wastewater management company for disposing of contaminated water without a permit, and releasing toxic chemicals in fresh water on a piece of property in West Texas.The company, Clean Tech Waste Solutions, based in Austin, was fined more than $5,000 on Tuesday for multiple violations spanning several months, commission documents show. But Commissioner Ryan Sitton argued that fine wasn’t enough for a company that repeatedly broke state rules regarding water protection. The Railroad Commission issues permits for the disposal of wastewater from oil and gas production, which can be injected deep underground or put into surface containment ponds.The company could not immediately be reached for comment.Inspectors for the commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry, visited Clean Tech’s facility in Big Lake, south of Midland, eight times between February 2015 and August 2016 and reported contaminated soil and no efforts to clean it up. Some inspections found that rainfall had caused a frac tank — which holds water and chemical mixture used in hydraulic fracturing — to overflow and contaminate the surrounding area.In a report, the staff asked the commission’s to fine the company because “discharges of oil and gas wastes can contaminate the land surface, affect the health of humans and animals, and may eventually be discharged to surface or subsurface waters, causing pollution.

By Mella McEwen, MRT.com/Midland Reporter-TelegramCaptionCloseThe Permian Basin continues to dominate the state – and the nation – in energy production. But a new report says the area also continues to dominate in illegal air pollution, according to 2017 figures."Major Malfunction," issued by the Environment Texas Research and Policy Center, found Midland-area industrial facilities reported releasing 37 million pounds of pollution into the air without authorization. Statewide, facilities reported releasing more than 63 million pounds without authorization, a 27 percent increase over the previous year."This is the third year we've gotten this analysis (so) we're not surprised about the continued violations," Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said in a phone interview. He said the continued increase in emissions in the Midland-Odessa is concerning and that the group had hoped for a decline.OIL REPORT: One-day conference to examine parent-child well dynamicsThe report criticized the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for what it called a lack of enforcement action, noting that over the last seven years, the total number of enforcement orders filed by the agency is less than 3 percent of the total number of emissions events it recorded during that time.Brian McGovern, media relations specialist with the TCEQ, told the Reporter-Telegram via email that the commission "does not comment on the reports of other groups. However, we vigorously defend our enforcement process.""They defend their process but the numbers speak for themselves," Metzger said. "These are self-reported violations. They're emphasizing the carrot approach rather than the stick approach. If the carrot approach were working, we'd see declines in emissions."Ben Shepperd, president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, said via email, "In a cursory review of the report, it's clear that the goal of this report is to point merely at emissions that occurred more than a year ago, largely in routine maintenance, in order to criticize the ongoing efforts of energy industry companies to safely and responsibly develop natural resources."The Permian Basin has produced untold prosperity for the region and the state," he said. "This report only focuses on a small portion of the challenges that the industry faces. Frankly, if organizations would follow our lead in supporting the financial needs of the state agencies involved in these regulatory functions, we'd see these reports in a more genuine light."Shepperd also came to the defense of the TCEQ."However, it is always easy to criticize those on the frontlines. While these critics will continue to sound alarms in skewed reports, the Permian Basin will continue to provide prosperity for the region and the state and the Permian Basin Petroleum Association will continue to proudly represent these good actors in creating a more prosperous America and Texas," he said in the email.OIL REPORT: Proposed Winkler County refinery could benefit local drivers' pocketbooksTopping the report's list of worst polluters in the Midland-Odessa area was the Waha Header Compressor Station on the Trans-Pecos Pipeline in Pecos County.In a statement emailed to the Reporter-Telegram, Energy Partners said the emissions event was "the result of an isolated event due to scheduled work that occurred on the pipeline back in 2017. This is not something that will be reoccurring. Our environmental policy is to have as few emission events as possible through a focused effort on operational performance. We are also committed to habitat conservation, land restoration and minimizing our footprint where possible."The report cites some complaints filed with TCEQ, including one filed June 16, 2017 that alleged emissions from the James Lake Gas Plant in Ector County and Seminole Gas Processing Plant in Gaines County were impacting children at a summer camp. The Seminole Gas Processing Plant reported a release of more than 1.19 million pounds of sulfur dioxide on June 15-21, while James Lake Gas Plant released 21,249 pounds of sulfur dioxide during an event that on June 12-15."Occidental Petroleum took over operatorship of the Seminole Plant in September 2017, and is actively investing in programs to control, monitor and minimize emissions from that plant as we do for all of our operated assets," Clint Williamson, manager of communications and public affairs, told the Reporter-Telegram by email.RELATED: Water In Energy conference gears up for second year"Occidental Petroleum is committed to conducting its business in a manner that protects the health and safety of people and the environment at its facilities and in the communities where we operate," he said. "We are continuously seeking improvement in resource recovery, conservation, pollution prevention, energy efficiency, including ongoing efforts to manage and capture methane and other greenhouse gas emissions."Also cited as a top polluter was Anadarko Petroleum's Silvertip 76 17 Unit P 1H in Loving County.John Christiansen, vice president, corporate communications with Anadarko, said, "Reducing emissions is a key focus for all of our U.S. onshore activities. In the Delaware Basin of West Texas specifically, we are utilizing a tankless development approach that greatly reduces emissions from our operations."We also use Forward-looking infrared camera technology to detect and address leaks and have expanded our infrastructure to largely eliminate the need for venting or flaring," Christiansen said via email. "The emissions cited in the report are related to a well-control event that occurred in 2017. We reported both the event and associated emissions to the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality respectively, with the Railroad Commission overseeing the cleanup that was completed in 2017."Chevron's Mabee Ranch CO2 Plant in Andrews County and J.T. McElroy 202 TB in Crane County were also cited in Environment Texas' report.In a statement emailed to the Reporter-Telegram, the company said, "We have seen the Environment Texas Research & Policy Center report and are in the process of reviewing their data and methodology. Chevron reports emissions events as required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. In February 2017, we experienced an event at the Mabee C02 Plant, which accounted for over 80 percent of the facility's emissions referenced in the report. In 2018, we made significant investments in the McElroy field and Mabee C02 Plant to decrease emissions and improve reliability. Chevron supports efforts to reduce emissions and continues to invest in our operations to improve environmental performance."Metzger called on the Texas Legislature to eliminate a loophole known as "affirmative defense" that he said allows polluters to escape penalties. He said that the Environmental Protection Agency had told TCEQ to eliminate the loophole, but the agency refused. The issue is now in court."This should be a bipartisan consensus issue," said Metzger. "Everyone believes you should follow the law. We're talking about companies exceeding already-generous permits."When companies take the issue seriously and follow the law, emissions decline, he said.Many of the emissions events cited in the report are preventable and avoidable, he said, citing memos from the EPA dating back to the 1980s that say the incidents are preventable and avoidable.Inaction is costing the Texas economy, and also is leading to about $150 million in health care costs to treat asthma, heart attacks and cancer, among other ailments, he said.And because "we haven't gotten the enforcement we need from the EPA or the state, we're going to enforce our rights by going to court until we get vigorous enforcement," Metzger said.

By Ashley McBrideCaptionCloseAs winds push smoke from the Camp Fire to the south, air quality in the Bay Area is expected to worsen Monday.Ryan Walbrun, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service for the Bay Area, said he expects smoke concentration levels in the air to be high in those areas through at least Monday.The forecast depends on the behavior of the Camp Fire — high winds peaking in Butte County on Sunday could cause the blaze to spread to the south.“A lot of the active heat is south of Paradise now,” Walbrun said. “It’s moving in the direction toward Oroville but still well outside of it at this time.”Low visibility caused by the smoke led to flight delays Sunday at San Francisco International Airport, said Chris Morgan, an airport spokesman.The FAA implemented two Ground Delay Programs, which limit the number of arrivals an airport can accept in a given time. The first started at 9 a.m. and ended at 3 p.m., and another ran from 6:30 p.m. until midnight. Two cancellations were reported by Sunday evening, plus 202 delays, averaging about 35 minutes, said Airport Duty Manager Maria Buyco. She added that it’s unclear whether all were caused by the ground delay program.The local air quality index of 156 is unhealthy and can exacerbate conditions for those with heart and lung diseases. Officials at the Bay Area Air Quality Management District recommend residents stay inside, keep windows and doors closed, and avoid exercising outside.A winter Spare the Air alert is also in effect, banning residents from burning wood indoors or outdoors.Even short-term exposure to fine particles can cause persistent cough, runny nose, phlegm and wheezing, according to the California Department of Public Health. The department warns that surgical masks, dust masks, bandannas or other face coverings do not offer protection from particle pollution. For adults, N95 or P100 masks are recommended.Ashley McBride is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: ashley.mcbride@sfchronicle.comTwitter: @ashleynmcb

A fire tore through the area on the evening of Oct. 8, destroying properties and vineyards.Air quality in the Bay Area will be in the “red” unhealthy zone Wednesday for the sixth consecutive day because of smoke from the deadly Camp Fire in Butte County.Residents who are outside for long periods of time can wear N95 respiratory masks to filter out harmful particles from the smoke that damage lungs, but officials at the Bay Area Air Quality Management District recommend people stay indoors to avoid inhaling the hazy, smoke-filled air.The air indoors, however, is only better if people keep windows and doors closed to block the smoky air from coming inside, air quality agency spokeswoman Sarah Zahedi said.“You’re more exposed when you’re outside than when you’re inside,” she said. “We encourage people to purchase a HEPA air filter and create at least one clean air room in your house.”Parts of the Bay Area could see shifts and differing levels of air quality, with some counties experiencing unhealthy air and others with moderate air.“Since wildfire smoke is unpredictable, conditions can change and fluctuate quickly,” Zahedi said. “While it may be moderate for one period, it can quickly shift.”She added that light winds are keeping the smoke hovering over the region. Residents should expect unhealthy air quality through at least Friday, when the forecast on smoke becomes more ambiguous.In Sonoma County, Gravenstein Union and River Montessori schools closed because of the air. San Francisco Unified School District schools remained open, but officials said they would be monitoring smoke levels in order to take the necessary precautions, like canceling sports practices and games. A red alert was issued for the city Wednesday morning.A Spare-the-Air advisory is in effect through at least Friday, prohibiting residents from burning wood, which could worsen the air quality, authorities said.The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management published a map of filtered air facilities in the city, where residents can go to get a reprieve from the smoke. The list includes public libraries and Westfield San Francisco Centre. Ashley McBride is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: ashley.mcbride@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @ashleynmcb

In Oakland, the reading was nearly as bad as San Francisco's at 256."These are the highest levels we've had in the Bay Area ever since I've been here," says Richard Muller, a physics professor at UC Berkeley who co-founded the Berkeley Earth site tracking air quality around the world.In recent days Northern California has felt as if it is under siege as the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history continues to rage near Chico and pump noxious smoke into the air.The acrid smoke from the Camp Fire irritates the lungs and stings the eyes, and Northern California residents from Butte County to the Bay Area are staying inside, huddled next to air filters, to limit smoke exposure. Many school districts canceled class Friday and San Francisco Airport has reported delays due to limited visibility all week.ALSO: Forecast keeps changing, but one thing looking increasingly likely: Rain in Butte County next week On Thursday, the index that measures the public health impacts of pollution, peaked in San Francisco at 245, breaking the record-hitting hourly readings the city saw in October 2017 when the North Bay wildfires were burning. The Sacramento Valley, Chico area and Livermore have also seen "hazardous" levels in recent days.The current weather pattern with a light offshore breeze from the Sacramento Valley blowing directly into the Bay Area is a perfect recipe for delivering smoke into the region. The smoke is pouring into the San Francisco area and it's moving slowly enough that it can't make its way over coastal mountains. The only way out is the Golden Gate and that's a narrow opening.What's more, S.F.'s natural air-conditioner — the ocean breeze — has been turned off with a high-pressure system over the area and blocking Pacific systems. San Franciscans are used to breathing that fresh ocean air but this week they've received little of it.MORE: No relief: Dire Bay Area air conditions now forecast through TuesdayThe San Francisco Bay Area can't expect significant relief from the wildfire smoke-choked air until next week. The current weather pattern is going to hold through Tuesday, and on Wednesday a storm in the forecast is expected to finally bring relief from the noxious air."There will be a change in wind direction, and that clean marine air coming in from the Pacific," says Spencer Tangen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Monterey office. " That onshore wind will be stronger, and it'll help to mix out the smoke, and push the smoke out."There's also a 30 to 40 percent chance of rain on Wednesday, and Tangen says, "The rain will actually remove some of the smoke itself." Rain also returns to the forecast on Thursday, with a 40 to 50 percent chance.

By Nancy AldermanThe Connecticut Council on Environmental Quality Annual Report, released April 17, showed that we all breathed unhealthy air for 31 days last year. We knew that last summer had 30 days of temperature 90 degrees or higher — but now we also know that we had even more days than that of bad air. Our air was heavily polluted with ground-level ozone.Ground-level ozone is created when car exhaust is mixed with sunlight, which is why ozone levels are higher in the summer months.However, the majority of Connecticut’s ozone pollution comes not from our automobiles but from the coal-fired power plants of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, where their emissions flow eastward into Connecticut.Connecticut is taking a proactive stance on this issue by petitioning the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to require dirty midwestern power plants to clean up their emissions. The Connecticut petition is being joined by Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Pennsylvania.What are the health effects of ozone and why is it important to reduce our exposures?Ozone, even small amounts, affects our lungs and our breathing.Ozone can cause the muscles in airways to constrict, trapping air and leading to wheezing and shortness of breath. Ozone can cause coughing and sore throats, it can make lungs more susceptible to infection, inflame and damage  airways, increase the frequency of asthma attacks, aggravate emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma and cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.Long-term exposure to ozone is likely to be one of the many causes of asthma. Long-term exposures to higher concentrations of ozone may be linked to permanent lung damage and abnormal lung development in children.A New York University Study, published May 8, 2016, in the American Thoracic Society and Marron Institute Report, estimated 168 people die every year in Connecticut from bad air and about 472 people have a major health event due to air pollution, according to the report.The 31 days that Connecticut’s air was laden with ground-level ozone is a serious problem for our health. What can be done to help Connecticut’s citizens on these bad air days?1. Attorney General George Jepsen is doing his part by petitioning the EPA to clean up the midwestern power plants and to threaten to bring the EPA to court if they do not comply.2. On bad air days, when it is hard to breathe, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection could declare no wood-burning. Wood smoke also causes breathing problems because it contains chemical-laden particulates that also go deep into the lungs.The largest single source of outdoor fine particles in many American cities is from wood smoke. Wood smoke and tobacco smoke are quite similar in their chemical composition. According to the EPA many components of wood smoke are carcinogenic and have many of the same components as cigarette smoke. The particles of wood smoke are so small they can penetrate into the deepest recesses of the lungs. These particles become efficient vehicles for transporting toxins into the lungs where they pass directly into the bloodstream.Both ground level ozone and wood smoke are detrimental to lung function and both have serious health implications. The combination of being exposed to two serious lung damaging agents at the same time is a recipe for creating serious human health impacts. Adding wood smoke emissions to ozone-laden air is a lethal combination that is enough to send many to emergency rooms.Environment and Human Health Inc. commends the CEQ on its informative report. EHHI also commends the Connecticut attorney general for working to curb pollution that comes into Connecticut from midwestern power plants, and EHHI continues to ask the Connecticut DEEP to restrict wood burning on “bad air days” for the sake of all of us and our health.“No other New England state had more than 11 days with unhealthful levels of ozone,” the Council On Environmental Quality reports says.Connecticut had 31 days.Nancy Alderman is president of Environment and Human Health Inc.

Tribune News ServicesBy BRIAN GILMOREGuest Columnist(TNS) There is something terribly disturbing about the contaminated water crisis in Flint.When state leaders can’t even deliver basic services such as safe drinking water, they have failed.The background to the tragic situation is an austerity politics that seeks to cut back basic government services in the name of cost-cutting.The city of Flint switched its water source from Lake Huron (which is where Detroit gets its water) to the Flint River in April 2014.It was a move designed to save a very economically depressed city some money. It was the wrong move.An emergency manager appointed by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder signed off on the decision. Rather than putting the interests of citizens first, the unelected, all-powerful emergency manager was charged with making hard-headed “business” decisions.That approach — in Flint and elsewhere around the country — has had disastrous results.Right away, children and residents got sick from drinking the water, even though the city managers assured them it was safe.By August, the water tested positive for E. coli and by September 2014, citizens had been advised to boil their water before drinking it by local officials.In January 2015, residents were lining up daily to get free bottled water and the city was found to be in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.The number of children testing positive for elevated levels of lead had skyrocketed since the switch from Lake Huron.By April 2015 city officials were demanding that the water source be changed back but had no power to make it happen. State officials, led by Snyder, dragged their feet and did not take the unfolding disaster seriously.It got worse.By July 2015, the governor’s office still did nothing substantial to deliver safe drinking water to the citizens in the city. Children continued to suffer.It was only just recently, after months of delay and failed leadership, and calls from citizens for the arrest and indictment of Snyder, that the Snyder administration finally declared a state of emergency.The state now is providing access to clean water to the citizens of Flint. Snyder apologized twice to the city for his mistakes.Yet doctors say it will take years to determine the extent of damage to children in the city due to exposure to lead. The children who sustained brain damage will never recover.The water crisis in Flint did not have to happen.Yet politicians around the country are similarly putting cost-cutting ahead of the health of thousands of citizens in their states by refusing to accept the federal funds to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.This is no way to serve the people. The people of Flint and others deserve a government responsive to their basic needs, not one beholden to an anti-democratic ideology.Brian Gilmore wrote this for Progressive Media Project, a source of liberal commentary on domestic and international issues; it is affiliated with The Progressive magazine.

By Noi MahoneyEastside residents continue to find trash such as old mattresses dumped illegally on Badger Street in District 2.Eastside residents continue to find trash such as old mattresses dumped illegally on Badger Street in District 2.CaptionCloseEastside residents continue to find trash such as old mattresses dumped illegally on Badger Street in District 2.Eastside residents continue to find trash such as old mattresses dumped illegally on Badger Street in District 2.Some Eastside residents are getting fed up with people illegally dumping trash in their neighborhoods and say they want to do something about it.Wray Hood, president of the Coliseum/Willow Park Neighborhood Association in District 2, said the problem has been piling up for months, and the group wants it stopped.“It just makes you sick to have to drive by and see all that garbage on your streets,” Hood said. “You recognize it as uncaring people.”The neighborhood of Coliseum/Willow Park — with boundaries of East Commerce Street to the north, Spriggsdale Boulevard to the west, Martin Luther King Boulevard to the south and Salado Creek to the east — sits in the shadows of the AT&T Center and Freeman Coliseum.Hood said that two areas where people continually dump junk are Badger Street and Aransas Street near the Interstate 10 overpass.“It's just terrible dumping,” she said. “Everything a person can dump there, they will.”Shirley Davis, another member of the neighborhood group, added Badger Street has been a constant source of problems for the area.“It's awful, all kinds of things end up there, old mattresses, furniture, just junk,” Davis said. “It's really weird. The city comes out and cleans it up, and people come back and dump again.”The Coliseum/Willow Park Neighborhood Association will be holding a rally against illegal dumping at 9 a.m. this morning at the corner of Aransas and Lone Oak streets.“(We'll) make an issue out of it, and maybe that will help us,” Hood said.Davis said she has actually observed people dumping — or about to dump — junk illegally on the streets, but she is afraid to confront them. “Maybe, if it's possible, we could add cameras to see them and get their license plate numbers,” Davis said.District 2 City Councilwoman Ivy R. Taylor could not be reached for comment.Southside resident George Garcia said illegal dumping continues to be a problem “all over the city.” Dumping sites around the South Side have included areas off Southton Road and Loop 410; and others off of Villamain Road.Last year, Garcia led a push to clean up Southtown and Villamain streets in District 3.“Villamain continues to be a problem because certain individuals don't have any respect or values and discard their trash on city streets and private properties,” Garcia said. “We need to teach our future generation about protecting our environment. We cannot continue to pollute our creeks and rivers.”Garcia said District 3 Councilwoman Leticia Ozuna and her staff have been helpful in the fight against illegal dumping.“We continue to report illegal dumping and are hoping that the message is received that we will not let a certain few impose their will on those of us that are trying to protect the environment,” Garcia said. nmahoney@primetimenewspapers.com

By Gary Stoller Conn. Health I-Team WriterCaptionCloseNearly half of the 60 companies that are allowed to discharge wastewater directly into Connecticut’s rivers, brooks and other bodies of water exceeded the amounts of toxic metals or other pollutants that their permits allowed over the last three years, a C-HIT analysis of federal data shows.Despite the violations, the state Department of Energy & Environmental Protection fined only two of the 29 companies found to be in noncompliance with their permits—a record that state environmental advocates called alarming, but that the agency said is justified.The 29 companies discharged excessive amounts of pollutants during at least one three-month period from October 2013 to September 2016. At least 19 companies exceeded by more than 100 percent the amounts they were allowed to discharge, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data.The data also show 23 of the 60 companies were found in noncompliance with terms of their permits for at least half of the three years—for reasons ranging from excessive discharges to submitting late discharge reports. Thirteen companies were found in significant noncompliance—the most serious level of violation—for three months or more. While DEEP has the authority to fine or take court action against polluters, EPA records show it more commonly issues notices of violation or noncompliance or warning notices, opting to work with violators for months or years to correct the problems.Oswald Inglese, DEEP’s director of water permitting and enforcement, said that while the agency receives and generates a large volume of compliance monitoring information monthly, reviewing all the information with limited resources “far exceeds the capacity of department staff.”Only two companies, Allnex USA of Wallingford and ReEnergy Sterling, were fined for violations of their National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits over the three-year period. DEEP levied a $52,000 fine in 2014 against Allnex, which discharges into the Quinnipiac River, and a $45,000 fine in 2014 against ReEnergy Sterling, which discharged into the Moosup River.State environmental groups say DEEP needs stronger enforcement instead of allowing companies to remain in noncompliance for months or years. The groups say DEEP should fine companies immediately. The lax enforcement, the groups say, results in the pollution of some of the state’s most popular waterways, such as the Connecticut, Naugatuck, Housatonic, Thames and Quinnipiac rivers.“The record of noncompliance with NPDES permits in Connecticut is extremely disturbing,” said Margaret Miner, executive director of Rivers Alliance of Connecticut. “While some of the violations are undoubtedly minor, some are serious, and all deserve scrutiny.”“Personally, I think if companies are blatantly and maliciously disobeying the law, they should face consequences, regardless of what the state’s budget situation is,” said Rep. James M. Albis, D-East Haven, the House deputy majority leader. “The reality is that we need enforcement and compliance staff to ensure that this is happening, and in difficult budget times, these types of staff tend to be on the chopping block, or positions are not filled after retirements.”Inglese said the agency uses computer algorithms to determine which companies are in significant noncompliance and then investigates whether an enforcement response is warranted. The agency often works with violators to determine why they are noncompliant and to get them into compliance. “Any violation is grounds for enforcement action, but that does not mean that all noncompliance is immediately actionable or always subject to formal enforcement and penalties,” Inglese said.Companies found in noncompliance for many months or years are not automatic candidates for fines, he added. “Case-by-case circumstances vary and must be evaluated based on their specific situations.”He said companies may be noncompliant while implementing “a long-term plan to reduce or eliminate noncompliance,” or because of an error on a permit application or “external impediments” beyond their control. Some companies have been involved in bankruptcy proceedings or facility shutdowns that leave behind unresolved environmental problems, he said.DEEP’s enforcement response “is primarily focused on occurrences of significant noncompliance,” Inglese said. “Those that are not considered significant noncompliance are recorded and noted for further evaluation and possible action at any time in the future.”The federal Clean Water Act prohibits companies except those holding NPDES permits from directly discharging pollutants through a “point source”—such as a pipe, ditch, channel or tunnel—into a body of water.The permits limit what kinds of materials can be discharged and their amounts, and set monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure the discharge does not contaminate the water and impact public health. Industrial permit holders are required to self-report discharge data monthly to DEEP, which provides the data to the EPA. The EPA segments the data quarterly so noncompliance in a single month is reflected as noncompliance for an entire quarter.Under the Clean Water Act, any noncompliance is considered a violation and grounds for enforcement or loss of a permit.Four industrial permit holders—Connecticut Galvanizing of Glastonbury, UniMetal Surface Finishing in Thomaston, Plainfield Renewable Energy in Plainfield and the U.S. Navy’s submarine base in Groton—were found in noncompliance every quarter from October 2013 to September 2016, the data show. None were fined by DEEP.Connecticut Galvanizing, which discharges into the wetlands of Hubbard and Salmon brooks, was issued a violation notice in 2012 and two more in 2014, Inglese said. By mid-2014, DEEP “escalated the matter into a mediation effort between Connecticut Galvanizing and other involved parties” to allow the company to install a storm water treatment system required by its permit, he said.In all of 2015 and 2016, Connecticut Galvanizing discharged much more copper, lead and zinc than its permit allowed, but it was not issued a violation notice. In late 2015, for example, the company discharged storm water runoff into Salmon Brook that contained 223,000 percent more zinc and 1,980 percent more lead than allowed.“All parties were aware of Connecticut Galvanizing’s noncompliance, so the issuance of further notices of violation was viewed as redundant,” Inglese said.Connecticut Galvanizing paid a $45,000 fine to the federal government and nearly $150,000 to the Farmington River Watershed Association to settle a lawsuit brought by the Environment Connecticut and Toxins Action Network, under the Clean Water Act in October 2016.Connecticut Galvanizing did not respond to requests for comment.UniMetal, a metal finisher of parts for the aerospace, automotive and other industries, was in significant noncompliance in 2016, according to EPA data. The company discharged 293 percent more cyanide, 40 percent more copper and 16 percent more nitrogen into the Naugatuck River than its permit allows. Two DEEP violation notices remain open in that case, Inglese said. The company hired technical consultants to determine the cause of the noncompliance and is undergoing a toxicity identification and reduction evaluation, he said. UniMetal President George LaCapra Jr. said the company “has a long history of being a responsible steward of the community and highly respects the waters of Connecticut.” He said the company is cooperating with DEEP “on how to best meet our current and future NPDES permit obligations.”Plainfield Renewable Energy, which discharged into the Quinebaug River, was issued two violation notices in 2014 “for sampling and reporting errors and multiple effluent violations” in 2013 and 2014, Inglese said. The noncompliance has since been resolved.Plainfield Renewable Energy was “a distressed asset,” and most of its violations occurred before it was purchased in July 2015 by Greenleaf Power, said Matt Ross, a spokesman for Greenleaf Power, which owns and operates biomass facilities in the United States and Canada.Since taking over operations, there have been only four minor permit issues, Ross said. “All issues have been reported and addressed, and, in each case, did not rise to the level of regulatory enforcement,” he said.The Navy submarine base in Groton had multiple effluent violations and discharged oil and grease far above its permitted limits into the Thames River. The submarine base discharged 100 percent more oil and grease in July-September 2016, and 690 percent more oil and grease in July-September 2015.  On April 6, Chris Zendan, public affairs officer SUBASE New London, wrote in an e-mail, “As CT DEEP noted, case-by-case circumstances, related to an activity’s noncompliance for many months or years, can vary and must be evaluated based on their specific situations. The base is dedicated to being a good steward of the environment and works diligently with the EPA and CT DEEP to that end.”He wrote, “In this effluent case...SUBASE believes the findings may be in error and has been investigating the issue with DEEP since late 2015.”Eight companies were found in noncompliance in 10 to 12 quarters from October 2013 to September 2016, the data show. Shelton-based Autoswage Products, for example, was found in noncompliance in 10 quarters, including the last quarter of 2013, when it discharged 517 percent more copper and 58 percent more iron into the Housatonic River than its permit allowed.Autoswage President Keith Brenton said the company, which manufactures contact and connector pins, recently emerged from bankruptcy and has no plans to discharge wastewater in the future. The DEEP said it denied renewal of Autoswage’s discharge permit, and the company has not discharged since December 2013.Allnex, one of the two companies fined over the three years, is a manufacturer of coating resins. Records show it discharged 258 percent more aluminum than allowed in 2014, and 3,020 percent more acrylonitrile than allowed in 2015. Acrylonitrile is a poisonous compound used widely in the manufacture of plastics, adhesives and synthetic rubber.Frank DiCristina, Allnex’s site manager in Wallingford, said that since 2013, the company has embarked on “a systematic program to ensure the highest level of environmental compliance and voluntary improvement beyond compliance.”DiCristina said Allnex reduced toxic emissions by 80 percent from 2012 to 2015, installed a new operating control system for its wastewater treatment plant, and implemented a community advisory board comprised of local citizens, conservation groups and others. But EPA records show that, after the company was fined in 2014, DEEP found subsequent effluent violations and issued a notice of violation in March 2015. Allnex provided “an adequate response,” Inglese said, and the notice of violation was closed three months later. Records show Allnex was out of compliance in every quarter of 2015, including two after the notice of violation was closed, and the first three quarters of 2016. ReEnergy Sterling was fined for discharging polluted storm water and groundwater into the Moosup River “on various occasions,” and failing to “properly operate and maintain their storm water retention basin,” according to DEEP. ReEnergy Sterling was a waste-to-energy facility that used waste tires as a fuel source.Sarah Boggess, a spokeswoman for ReEnergy Holdings, said the Sterling energy plant was shut down in October 2013 and sold in September 2016. The fine related to a higher amount of zinc than allowed in storm water during a rainstorm when the plant was shut down for repairs in December 2011, she said.Roger Reynolds, legal director of Connecticut Fund for the Environment/Save the Sound, said companies found in noncompliance should be immediately fined and not given months to comply. Reynolds said his group conducts its own investigations of violations, and if appropriate, will file suit against violators.He said DEEP is staffed by “good people” who are “radically under-resourced,” and “don’t do a whole lot of enforcement.”DEEP officials saidmany rivers, streams and lakes are now cleaner than they have been in the past 100 years, and once badly polluted rivers, such as the Willimantic, Naugatuck, Pequabuck, Quinnipiac, Connecticut and Farmington, are now used for many recreational pursuits.Miner, of the Rivers Alliance, said more work needs to be done, pointing out that only 30 percent of accessible river miles in Connecticut meet Clean Water Act standards for swimming and fishing.This story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (www.c-hit.org).

By Mary O’Leary moleary@nhregister.com @nhrmoleary on TwitterNEW HAVEN >> It was deja vu all over again.Morris Cove residents Thursday came out, as they did five years ago, and opposed the possibility of any contaminated dredging material being dumped into a “borrow pit” in New Haven’s outer harbor, yards from their homes on the East Shore.The Army Corps of Engineers in October 2010 had a hearing on a proposal to deposit up to 400,000 cubic yards of material in the New Haven pit as the most cost-effective plan for the long-delayed dredging of Bridgeport Harbor. That has yet to be approved or federal funding allocated for Bridgeport. The Army Corps hearing this time was on a draft of a long-term plan that looked at all the dredging projects in Connecticut with a ranking of potential disposal sites over the next three decades. The comment period on this Draft Dredged Material Management Plan (DMMP) is open until Oct. 16. “It is too close to where people live,” Don Shoop told Army Corps officials of any plan that would put contaminated spoils in New Haven Harbor. “If it is too contaminated to put in the open ocean, then it is too contaminated to put in Morris Cove.”The borrow pit was created in the late 1950s when it was excavated for gravel to construct Interstate 95. If the site was ever used for this kind of materials, the corps would create a CAD (confined acquatic disposal) cell to contain it. Corps official Steve Wolf said they have been using them for decades and they are safe.Claudia Bosch, another Morris Cove resident, said a 2003 corps Disposal Area Monitoring System study showed signs of groundwater intrusion at the borrow pit.“By osmosis, the hazardous carcinogenic substances will eventually be in the groundwater and thus in my neighbors’ basements,” Bosch said. She said the DMMP acknowledges this, “but still does not rule out the Cove as a dumping ground.”She worried about the 9-month period before a CAD is capped and the 2 percent of the material that is lost in its creation.“Lost does not mean it disappears. Rather it gets dispersed into the water, then settles onto the beaches and later gets blown into our yards,” she said.Bosch said references to “environmentally acceptable placements” were “hollow and empty words.”Another neighbor, John Cox, said the report fails to refute or even acknowledge the concerns of those living in Morris Cove on the potential for contamination of the area.There were many references to the recreational uses of the inner harbor and the loss of the beach at Morris Cove when the borrow pit was dug. Renee Dix said this is an opportunity to “get back the beach” by refilling the borrow pit with clean fill.“We deserve to get back what was taken,” she said.Rachel Heerema said she was in favor of the overall plan in its support of the maritime industry, but not the potential use of Morris Cove as a dumping area,“I am opposed to the organization of this report with the lowest-cost option as the leading metric and with environmental impacts as an unweighted factor,” she said.The initial reason for the study, as requested by the Connecticut and New York in 2005, was to look at reducing dependence on open-water disposal sites for dredging.Louis Burch, Connecticut program director for Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said by  emphasizing the “short-term costs instead of the long-term solutions,” the 10-year, $7 million study failed to live up to the 2005 agreement between the states. State Rep. Patricia Dillon, D-New Haven, said the plan appears to create a disadvantage for New Haven as the city has future needs of its own with an upcoming study of deepening the port.The plan did look at using suitable dredging material to enhance beaches and marshes, but concluded that that would take care of only a small portion of the dredged material that would result from dredging necessary to keep the state’s marinas and deep water ports open for business.The state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection concluded that the open-water sites in Long Island must stay accessible and after 35 years of monitoring and active management of these sites said this option is environmentally sound.The DEEP and the entire federal delegation is in favor of the plan as a base from which to consider individual projects as they are proposed to the Army Corps of Engineers. It lays out the options with the base option the most cost-effective.A spokesman for the state Department for Transportation Thursday said Gov. Dannel P, Malloy will announce his support for it Friday as essential to the health of Connecticut’s maritime industry, calling it “science based” and enviromentally sound. The maritime industry generates 40,000 jobs in the state, he said.Malloy has promoted harbor development and there is now a statewide port authority in place, whose job is to enhance growth at the three deep-water ports in Connecticut.In October 2010, however, Malloy said he would oppose the depositing of spoils in New Haven’s “borrow pit,” as did U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro. Officials from the Army Corps of Engineers Thursday said the public could again raise its objections when a specific project was announced proposing such a use in New Haven.

By Madeline Stocker, ctnewsjunkie.comCaptionCloseIndustrial facilities discharged 224,029 pounds of toxic waste into Connecticut waterways in 2012, according to a report from the Environment Connecticut Research & Policy Center.Environment Connecticut, a statewide citizen-based environmental advocacy organization, released its report Thursday titled, “Wasting Our Waterways: Toxic Industrial Pollution and Restoring the Promise of the Clean Water Act.” Aside from the Connecticut data, the document details the release of 206 million pounds of toxins into U.S. waterways in 2012, and describes the impact of those toxins on the environment and human health.According to the report, industrial facilities dumped about 2,404 pounds of cancer-causing chemicals, 505 pounds of developmental toxins and 1,567 pounds of reproductive toxins into Connecticut waterways in 2012. The report says the specific chemicals are known to cause a range of developmental and reproductive disorders. The toxins render many waterways, such as the Connecticut river, unswimmable and unfishable, the report says.The data on the pollutants, according to the report, came directly from the Environmental Protection Agency, which requires polluters to report toxic discharges into the nation’s waterways. The EPA tracks the data based on those disclosures through the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) program.Read more.

By Register StaffHARTFORD >> A Singapore shipping company agreed to pay a $1.2 million penalty after it admitted to illegally dumping oily wastewater in international waters, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut said in a press release.The company, Odfjell Asia II Pte Ltd, pleaded guilty Monday in federal court to violating the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, the release said.If the company’s plea agreement is accepted by the court, about $300,000 of the penalty will go toward the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for projects that preserve and restore the marine environment of Long Island Sound, the release said. Company senior engineer Ramil Leuterio, 42, a citizen of the Philippines, also pleaded guilty to one count of violating the act for his role in directing lower-ranking crew members to make the illegal discharges and for failing to accurately maintain the vessel’s oil record book, the release said. He faces a maximum of six years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Both defendants will be sentenced May 14.Odjfell will implement an environmental management plan as part of the agreement. Odjfell will implement an environmental management plan as part of the agreement, it said. Employees and the crew of any vessel operated by the company will be trained in preventing maritime pollution. An independent monitor will report to the court regarding the company’s compliance during its three-year probation, it said.The violation was discovered during a Nov. 6, 2012, Coast Guard inspection in New Haven, the release said. Odjfell was operator of a 577-foot, 26,327 gross ton petroleum/chemical tanker that discharged machinery space bilge water directly into the sea three times between October 2011 and October 2012, the release said. At the direction of Leuterio, crew members bypassed pollution prevention equipment that was designed to ensure that any discharged bilge water contain less than 15 parts per million of oil, the release said.  The crew then concealed the illegal discharges by making misleading entries and omissions in the vessel’s oil record book, it said.Crew members said Leuterio told them to use a complex system to transfer the bilge water from the bilge holding tank to the sewage tank. From the sewage tank, the bilge water was dumped directly into the sea without passing through pollution prevention equipment, it said. Once the bilge holding tank was emptied, Leuterio directed the lower ranking crew members to put clean fresh water and salt water into the tank, the release said. As the pollution prevention equipment automatically records the time it is being operated, Leuterio then processed the clean water through the  prevention equipment, and created an electronic record to account for the bilge water that had bypassed the equipment and been discharged directly overboard, the release said.

Johnny MillerCaptionCloseHere's a look at the past. Items have been culled from The Chronicle's archives of 25, 50, 75 and 100 years ago.March 4: The discovery of a parasite in the formerly pristine streams of the High Sierra, where San Francisco and Peninsula residents get their drinking water, may force the city to build a water filtration plant at the cost of more than $200 million, according to a report prepared by an engineering consulting firm. The parasite is the organism giardia lamblia, the cause of a debilitating illness called giardiasis - or "beaver fever." The giardia organism is carried in fecal matter of animals and humans and has become so widespread in the Sierra Nevada that park rangers warn visitors not to drink water from any stream without boiling it first.March 28: Samuel Goldwyn, with the aid of Lurline, steamed out of the Golden Gate yesterday afternoon, leaving behind a succinct statement of his singleness of mind. "I'm a one-man woman," he said "Nobody's traveling with me but my wife." Then with the fixed grin that stamps his famous face he said he was taking a couple of weeks away from the rigors of polishing up "Porgy and Bess." Speaking in a soft voice that barely escapes being a lisp, he said the motion picture business has been shoved into making the best possible pictures by the challenge of television. "The double bill is out. The cheap picture is done away with," he said. "I say without hesitation that 'Porgy and Bess' is the mark of a new era." Asked if he experienced any objection from Negro groups about making "Porgy and Bess," he said there was some opposition at first. "But when they understood what I was doing, they approved. I had requests from three Southern states for the premiere, Virginia, Louisiana and Charleston." March 28: No more will John Doe, robber, arsonist, murderer, be able to walk down Kearny Street in peace. Nay, nay ... his days are numbered. Also his nights. For the airwaves will pursue him unto the third and fourth blocks on Mission Street. It seems that inventors of radio equipment have contrived a little knickknack that will place the crook in the arms of the law. The knickknack is a one-tube radio, weighing less than 44 ounces, that members of the police force will be able to carry around with the greatest ease. For uniformed men, the radio is concealed in a Sam Brown belt, which hides an antenna in the back. A tiny earphone is attached to the cap. For plainclothesmen, the radio may be carried under a coat with an earphone attached to a hat.April 4: Isabelle McMahon, 88, 793 Arguello Blvd., is today the only remaining survivor of the ill-fated Donner party. She shared the title with Mrs. John S. Schenck, 90, of Dalles, Ore., until yesterday morning when Mrs. Schenck died. Her death leaves McMahon the last of the group of 81 men, women and children, of whom 36 died after terrific hardships in the high Sierra in 1846. Most famous of the pioneer wagon trains to cross the country into California, the Donner party became snowbound for months. McMahon was 11 months old when she passed through the experience.March 31: San Francisco may follow others in some things but in one she will take the lead. She is likely to have a woman automobile demonstrator. It is no novel sight to see a woman driving a car about the streets of San Francisco. Many of the fair sex who own their own machines drive them freely in the country, and a few of them do not hesitate to pilot them through the busiest streets. But the business of demonstrating is a strenuous one and to none has it occurred to hire a woman. The present idea is that of C.S. Richardson of the Reliance Automobile Co. He said yesterday: "I think I will try the experiment if only I can find the proper woman. Any woman who knows a car and can keep a cool head can do anything with the machine that a man could do. The difficulty now is to find a prepossessing young woman who understands the principles of a motorcar and who has the gift of speech to descant on the beauties of touring etc. so we can take the money away from the prospective buyer in the least painful manner. The great object, however, is to demonstrate that cars of today are easily handled by women."April 3: Calamity and disaster threaten us. Among the other reforms proposed for the betterment of the new San Francisco comes one that will strike dismay into the hearts of the army of frankfurter and bologna sausage devotees who for years have been in the habit of eating their meals daily at the expense of some amiable saloon-keeper. A fight is to be made against the "free lunch counters," an institution that has been part of the city's life for generations. Rumors that such a fight was in progress have circulated at intervals but this time the sponsor is no less an influential institution than the Asiatic Exclusion League. In a communication sent to the Supervisors, a draft of the ordinance is proposed by A.E. Yoell, secretary of the league, asking the favorable consideration of the board. The ordinance would make it unlawful for those "licensed to sell, give away or dispose of intoxicating liquors ... to gratuitously distribute any article of food." Calamity and disaster.

Robert Cooke, NewsdayStrong reasons to worry about the long-term health of Northeast forests are coming from new, detailed studies of the impact of chronic pollution on mature trees, scientists report. After 11 years of experiments and surveys in three Northeast forest areas, researchers conclude that near-constant exposure to nitrogen- rich chemicals, from sources such as acid rain, reduces the vigor and growth rate of evergreen trees. Some evergreens are even killed. Airborne ozone also is detrimental, they said. Although the extra nitrates contributed via pollution act as a fertilizer, initially spurring tree growth, long-term additions of nitrates eventually saturate the ground, causing nutrients such as calcium, manganese and potassium to become mobile and leach out of the soil. Thus the soil eventually becomes impoverished, less able to support tree growth. Worse, as nitrate pollution continues, aluminum is mobilized in the soil, poisoning fish, such as trout, by disrupting normal function of their gills. The change in water acidity also is harmful for the fish. "The bottom line for forest productivity is that we should be concerned that maybe we're killing them (the trees) with kindness. Too much fertilizer may end up killing the trees" as well as the fish, said John Aber, professor of forest ecology at the University of New Hampshire. In addition, he said, ozone, a common pollutant that flows through Northeast forests, also has large impact. The latest estimates are that primary forest production -- the growth of wood -- is being reduced by about 10 percent, on average. Ozone is harder on the deciduous trees, including hardwoods such as oak, maple and birch, because of their relatively fast rates of respiration. The studies were conducted by Aber and more than a dozen other forest ecology specialists at the University of New Hampshire, the Woods Hole Marine Biology Laboratory in Massachusetts, the University of Minnesota, the U.S. Forest Service and the University of Maine. According to forest soil expert Ivan Fernandez, at the University of Maine in Orono, "there are several ways to look at the long-term consequences of pollution. One is to wait over time. But if that takes decades or centuries, then it's not appropriate for the development of policies" needed to address pollution problems. Another way, Fernandez said, "is to do manipulative studies and compare that to what hasn't been changed." While this kind of study isn't perfect, it does have the advantage of controlling the changes you want to study. "It provides valuable insight when compared to natural systems" that have not been altered in experiments. "So you can treat it like a black box, and also get inside the black box and study it," he explained. The studies that involved ecosystem manipulation focused on three sites that were picked for careful, long-term forest research. One is the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Mass. Another is on Mount Ascutney, in Vermont. And the third is the Bear Brooks Watershed, 60 miles inland from Acadia National Park, in Maine. One technique researchers used was to add regular doses of nitrogen- rich fertilizer -- ammonium sulfate dissolved in water -- to the carefully defined research plots. As the doses of fertilizer continued, the researchers measured how much nitrate leached into groundwater in the soil and came out in streams. They also tried to observe when the soil reached its nitrate saturation point and what happened after that. "We picked these sites because the Harvard forest is in a fairly heavily polluted region. The site in Maine is relatively free of pollution. And Mount Ascutney is a relatively high elevation spruce/fir forest," Aber said. In all three sites, he added, the trees are "second growth," meaning the original forests were harvested years ago and the trees have since regrown. "The Harvard forest was actually an agricultural site that has regrown" with native hardwoods. In addition, part of the Harvard forest is a plantation of red pines about 70 years old. Because of its location, and its agricultural history, Aber said, the Harvard forest offered some surprises. First, it was expected to be the most sensitive to nitrogen inputs, because it would already have had substantial amounts of nitrogen in the soil, from pollution. The site in Maine, in contrast, should have been almost pristine, because it doesn't receive large nitrogen inputs. So "we expected to see a lot of nitrate coming out" of soils in the Harvard forest, "but in fact we found the opposite," Aber said. "It seems to be this farming effect." In other words, "the forest had been cleared, and a lot of the nitrogen had been removed for many years, leaving the ground very nitrogen-poor. It's like a sponge that was squeezed very hard during the agricultural period, and there's a lot of room for it to absorb nitrogen now," he explained. The implication, Aber said, is that there's some good news for New England forests, most of which were cut a century ago, plowed, abandoned and then naturally reforested. "Forests treated in this way will be able to soak up a fair bit of nitrogen before they start to leak," Aber said. A second surprise came from the plot in Maine. Doses of fertilizer were added regularly to one stream catchment area, and the results were compared with a neighboring, unfertilized catchment, or stream drainage area. "Within Bear Brooks we found that the treated watershed responded quickly to the added nitrogen, by exporting nitrates" in the stream water, Fernandez said. "It started to leak out of the system even though the vast majority (of the nitrogen) was still accumulating in the forest. That suggests the (nitrate) signature may be more easily induced than we thought," since a small addition of nitrogen produced a quick outflow of nitrate. The quick outflow was also surprising, he said, because "we were adding nitrogen as ammonium, which should stick in the soil because it is positively charged. The trees should take it up. Yet almost immediately the nitrate was coming out in the streams. "Also, we knew that the nitrate that was coming out was not the nitrogen we had just added. So our treatment primed something to release it in a nitrate form," he said. "So the transformation occurred rather rapidly and primed an internal mechanism that released nitrogen that was already there." They could tell the difference because the nitrogen the researchers added as fertilizer contained elevated amounts of nitrogen-15, a slightly heavier form of nitrogen that can be detected with special equipment. Although the amount of sulfur coming to the forests has declined about 20 percent over the past two decades, the researchers noted that "nitrogen deposition remains relatively constant in the Northeast and is increasing in the Southeast and the West." Sulfur, an important part of acid rain, decreased because of emission controls installed on factories and power plants. Much of the nitrogen comes from automobile exhaust systems, which also produce harmful ozone. Research shows, in fact, that mature trees in the Northeast are being harmed by chronic exposure to excess ozone. Compared to adding excess nitrogen and causing a relatively slow change in the forest, "ozone is very different, because its effects are immediate," Aber said. According to a complex computer model, the ozone effect alone could reduce annual forest production by 3 percent to 16 percent. Related impacts on forest growth are expected to come from a gradual warming of the soil, a potential result of global warming. "Forests in the northeastern United States are dynamic ecosystems that have been shaped through geological and historical time by climate change, natural disturbance and human activity," the researchers said in their scientific report. What is remarkable, in fact, is how resilient forests have been in past centuries, despite being flattened occasionally by hurricane-force winds, fires, and ax-wielding settlers. What's happening now, however, goes beyond those earlier insults.

Frank Bajak, Associated PressCaptionClose When the sun beats particularly hot on this land in the middle of the jungle, the roads sweat petroleum. A Rhode Island-sized expanse of what was once pristine Amazon rain forest is crisscrossed with oil wells and pipeline grids built by Texaco Inc. a generation ago. And for the past 15 years, a class-action lawsuit has been wending its way through the courts on behalf of the more than 125,000 people who drink, bathe, fish and wash their clothes in tainted headwaters of the Amazon River. Now a single judge is expected to rule in the case in 2009 from a ramshackle courtroom in this northern frontier town. Statements from a court-appointed expert suggest Chevron Corp. - which bought Texaco in 2001 - will be held responsible for the many oil spills and dumping of toxic wastewater. If Chevron loses, it could be ordered to pay up to $27.3 billion in damages, though an appeal would be likely. The expert, geological engineer Richard Cabrera, largely accepts plaintiffs' claims that Texaco left a mess when it pulled out in 1990. He is recommending damages based partly on his calculation of 1,401 pollution-caused cancer deaths. Chevron does not deny "the presence of pollution and we don't deny that there were impacts," says spokesman Kent Robertson. But Chevron contends a 1998 agreement it signed with Ecuador, after spending $40 million on remediation, absolves it of any legal responsibility. It says, and few dispute, that its former partner, state oil company Petroecuador, kept polluting after Texaco departed. But two wrongs don't make a right, argues law Professor Judith Kimerling, a former New York state prosecutor whose 1991 book "Amazon Crude" first publicized what some environmentalists have called a rain forest Chernobyl. "I really think the remediation they did was a sham," she says. When Donald Moncayo was a kid, he remembers, Texaco soaked the dirt thoroughfares it cut through the jungle with crude to keep dust down. "We would run on roads they coated with oil," he says. "We went to sleep with our feet black. You could only remove it with gasoline." Pipelines across the area connected the wells to the 313-mile Trans-Ecuadorean Pipeline built by Texaco to carry crude to the Pacific. Moncayo, 35, can't remember when the pipelines weren't springing leaks. His mother died in 1987 from an internal infection he blames on oil contamination. Now he works for the plaintiffs, taking visitors on "toxic tours." One of the first stops is a fresh spill. It's little more than 50 gallons, dark and gooey. Bigger spills have smothered crops, choked birds, killed cattle. In the early days of the oil bonanza, Ecuador's government encouraged people to settle in the oil patch by offering free homesteads. But it provided almost no services - hardly any of the area's drinking water is treated. Ecuadorean governments reaped the wealth of Texaco's jungle project, with gross domestic product more than tripling from 1972 to 1977. By the time Texaco pulled out, the consortium it headed had extracted nearly 1.5 billion barrels of oil from more than 350 wells. In the meantime, Ecuadorean oilfield workers slathered the crude on their legs, believing it cured rheumatism. Some coated their scalps because American supervisors told them the crude warded off baldness, they said. "They were pulling our legs," recalls Margarita Yepez, a former Texaco social worker who believes such careless exposure to crude killed some of her colleagues. "What did we know? They were the experts." The plaintiffs say Texaco saved $8-$10 a barrel by dumping some 18 billion gallons of the wastewater from drilling into waste pits instead of injecting it back deep into the ground. The more than 1,000 waste pits were not lined, so the toxins seeped into the groundwater, they say. "They themselves said it was the cheapest production in Latin America," lead plaintiffs' attorney Pablo Fajardo says of Texaco. The plaintiffs also allege the company poisoned the air by burning off natural gas and set fire to solid wastes during the 1990s remediation. They say they found a July 1972 Texaco memo that orders the company's acting manager in Ecuador to report only major spills and destroy "all previous reports" on spills. One of the memo's two authors is Robert Bischoff, then Texaco's chief for Latin America. He retired in 1984. "I don't remember that," Bischoff, 89, said by phone from Florida. "In all my years with Texaco, and I was with them 40 years, I was never asked to do anything that I'd be ashamed of." Ironically, it was Chevron that first pushed to get the case heard in Ecuador. The oil company said a federal court in New York - where Texaco was based - had no jurisdiction and that Ecuador's judicial system was reliable and independent. In 2003, the case was refiled in Lago Agrio. But Rafael Correa was elected president in 2006, and everything changed. Chevron says it can't get a fair trial as long as Correa is running Ecuador. Last year, Correa led reporters on a tour of former drilling sites, declaring there had been no cleanup. The leftist U.S.-trained economist has expelled foreign oil companies that won't agree to his profit-sharing terms. And in August, Ecuador ordered a criminal investigation of two longtime Chevron executives and seven former government officials for allegedly falsifying the documents that endorsed Texaco's remediation. Chevron also complains vehemently that court-appointed expert Cabrera is a stooge of the plaintiffs. "He's put blinders on and says all conditions today are attributable to Chevron," says Robertson. The judge who appointed Cabrera, Juan Evangelista Nunez, denies any political motives. "The only truth that is constant in this case is that there will be no political influence of any kind here," he told the Associated Press. One stop on Moncayo's "toxic tour" is Campo Aguarico 2, a well he says was sealed in 1985. Its three wastewater pits were topped off with dirt during Texaco's cleanup. Moncayo plunges a surgical glove-sheathed hand into the muck of one pit. He pulls up rancid, oil-coated leaves from surrounding saplings. A pipe juts out of another pit, dripping what looks like crystalline water that reeks of petroleum hydrocarbons. Cabrera's 14-member team of scientists and engineers found petroleum hydrocarbons at levels deemed unsafe by national standards in 44 percent of the groundwater samples it tested. It found cadmium, barium, lead and other heavy metals in the mud of wastewater pits, and said 80 percent require cleanup. The team cited scientific studies that found cancer levels nearly twice Ecuador's norm, with stomach and uterine cancer the most common followed by leukemia. Chevron disputes the findings as based on unrepresentative samples and says the region's cancer rates are no higher than the countrywide norm. The chief doctor in Shushufindi, Fajardo's hometown, is troubled that more comprehensive studies haven't been done. Dr. Jorge Herrera says spontaneous abortions, respiratory infections, skin rashes and chronic gastritis are common. The toxic tour stops to pick up Carmen Perez, a 57-year-old public health worker who lives about 455 yards from a capped well - No. 56, La Primavera. The well water her family drinks has an acrid taste, she says, and her five children constantly suffer gastric pain. "What we have here is slow but certain death," Perez says as she pokes with a stick around the edge of an open wastewater pond. So why don't they move away? "We can't afford to." Walking away from the pond, the tourists look up at plump guayaba fruits hanging from a tree. They look tempting. "Better not," says Moncayo.

Elaine Kurtenbach, Associated Press This sprawling, jade-hued lake in eastern China is pleasant enough on a cool spring day. But when spring warms into sultry summer, Chaohu turns slimy and stinky as algae fed by sewage, farm and factory runoff bloom, leaving it toxic and undrinkable. China's pollution busters, banking on a rather unorthodox approach, are hoping this summer might be different. Across the country, officials desperate to meet a national goal of restoring China's severely polluted lakes by 2030 are dumping tons of voracious fish into lakes in hopes they will gobble up the algae infestations. Other countries have tried this in sewage treatment pools or drinking water reservoirs - with mixed success - but nowhere else has it been attempted on such a large scale. Workers dumped 1.6 million silver carp fry into Chaohu Lake in February in the largest such project in China. They expect each fish to eat up to more than 70 pounds of algae as they grow, helping to ensure clean drinking water for more than a million people. "We're trying to restore the ecological balance. That's the main principle," Che Jiahu, a local fisheries official, said in his chilly office in Zhongmiao, a small temple town on Chaohu's north shore. The village is a tourist attraction - when the algae is not in full bloom. Officials also hope the carp will revive a local fishing industry nearly wiped out by pollution. They shrug off questions about the wisdom of consuming fish that feed on pollutant-laden algae. "We've never heard of anyone getting sick from eating Chaohu's fish or aquatic products," Che said. The fish are not as tasty as when he was a child, he concedes, but "still, I believe fish that eat the algae are safe." About 125 miles east of Chaohu, fisheries workers released 100 million whitebait fry in Taihu Lake in March, hoping they will eat up the nitrogen and phosphorous that feed algae blooms that forced the cutoff of water to millions of residents last summer. Another 50 tons of whitebait and carp fry were dumped into Taihu last week to counter an unusually early algae bloom, said Fan Xiao, an official with the Taihu Fishery Administration. "We didn't really expect the first attempt to work right away," he explained. "This algae bloom makes us even more determined to carry on." It's not the first time China has resorted to novel strategies to combat stubborn problems. In the 1950s leader Mao Zedong ordered farmers to bang pots and pans to scare sparrows away from grain fields. The experiment backfired. All sorts of birds too frightened to alight dropped dead from exhaustion, allowing an explosion of crop-devouring pests that they might otherwise have eaten. In America, the use of carp to control algae in sewage treatment pools created problems when the nonnative fish escaped into waterways. In China, that's less of a problem, because carp are an indigenous species that have been fished for centuries. The tricky part is figuring out how many carp to put in a lake. Too few, and the algae will still prevail. Too many, and the waste from the fish themselves may simply feed more algae blooms, experts warn. The silver carp thrive on blue-green algae, which lurk in microscopic form until rising temperatures trigger a foul-smelling, often toxic bloom that saps the water of oxygen, killing fish and making it unhealthy to drink. From the U.S. to Australia, such blooms are flourishing across the globe, fueled by warming temperatures and pollution. In Israel, the use of silver carp and other filter-feeding fish in drinking water reservoirs has worked in some cases, and failed in others, says Ana Milstein, an aquaculture expert there. Others are more skeptical. China's undertaking "sounds like a big, artificial fix, which from my experience doesn't often work and often leads to more unplanned problems," says Paul Csagoly, an expert who worked on a project to clear fish that had been introduced to eat grass in the Danube River. History is replete with examples of the dangers of messing with Mother Nature. Toxic cane toads imported for beetle eradication on sugar cane plantations are a threat to Australia's indigenous wildlife. Mongooses introduced to the Hawaiian islands in the 19th century ended up doing more harm to native birds than to the rats they were meant to kill. Still, the folks in Chaohu seem to figure they have little to lose. A decade ago, the lake was already rated dangerously polluted. Loans from the Asian Development Bank helped pay for upgrading some heavily polluting factories and building sewage treatment plants. All to little avail. Two industrial cities of 5 million - Chaohu to the northeast and Hefei to the northwest - flank the lake, providing a steady diet of nitrogen, phosphorous and other nutrients to algae that last summer turned wide swaths of the lake a brilliant algae green, and then putrid black. "Economic development has had a negative impact on the lake. We're just finding ways to counteract that," Che says. The cleanup involves more than just stocking the lake with carp fry, says Ding Zhisong, deputy director of Chaohu's environmental bureau. He shows off a grove of trees planted in contaminated silt dredged from the lake. Dozens of fishing boats are moored nearby, their occupants busy mending nets and painting, since the lake is closed to fishing until mid-June. The water's edge is a soapy froth mixed with trash; the only sign of aquatic life, a tiny freshwater shrimp meandering through thick green fronds of algae. Most environmental experts warn against consuming carp and other bottom feeders from lakes such as Chaohu that are contaminated not just with algae but also with toxic chemicals such as lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic. Though the official government line is that the fish are fine, Yvonne Sadovy, a Hong Kong University professor who sometimes meets with fisheries experts in China, said some of them have expressed concern. While silver carp sometimes can consume toxic algae without becoming poisonous themselves, they also may absorb other contaminants, says Celia Chen, a Dartmouth College professor who has researched how pollution affects the food chain. "I would ask myself as a scientist and as a consumer, 'What would make me comfortable eating the fish?' and that would be knowing the fish tissue did not have contaminants in it," she said in an e-mailed response to an inquiry. She noted that most fish in China are never tested because of the expense involved. "I wouldn't eat them on a regular basis," she said.

New York Times2006-08-18 04:00:00 PDT Piraeus, Greece -- The U.N. Environment Program pledged about $64 million on Thursday to help clean up and contain a major oil spill caused by the conflict in Lebanon.The 87-mile-long slick, described by experts as the worst environmental disaster in Lebanese history, stained its Mediterranean shores after Israel bombed an oil storage depot at Jiyeh, south of Beirut, on July 13 and July 15.Continuing hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah had barred marine experts from inspecting the most severely affected waters. But Monday's cease-fire cleared the way for the start of an international effort to clean up and contain the spill, according to U.N., European Union and maritime officials.Lebanon began cleaning up the black sludge Wednesday. Up to 15,000 tons of heavy fuel poured into the Mediterranean Sea, also polluting the Syrian coast and threatening other nearby countries. "The treatment of this spill, the re-establishment of the ecosystem, will take years," Lebanese Environment Minister Yacoub Sarraf said.

Renee Schoof, McClatchy Newspapers A study released Thursday finds that 39 sites in 21 states where coal-fired power plants dump their coal ash are contaminating water with toxic metals such as arsenic, and that the problem is more extensive than previously estimated. The analysis of state pollution data by the Environmental Integrity Project, the Sierra Club and Earthjustice comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is considering whether to impose federally enforceable regulations for the first time. An alternative option would leave regulation of coal ash disposal up to the states, as it is now. The EPA will hold the first of seven hearings about the proposed regulation Monday in Arlington, Va. A public comment period ends Nov. 19. The electric power industry is lobbying to keep regulation up to individual states. Environmental groups say the states have failed to protect the public and that the EPA should set a national standard and enforce it. "This is a huge and very real public health issue for Americans," said the director of the study, Jeff Stant of the Environmental Integrity Project. "Coal ash is putting drinking water around these sites at risk." The Environmental Integrity Project is an organization that advocates for enforcement of environmental laws. "If people ask, is there a problem EPA should address, this report answers 'yes' with an exclamation mark," said Lisa Evans of Earthjustice, an environmental law firm. Evans said state regulation hasn't protected people living near the waste sites from health problems. Many states have allowed the dumps to be built without adequate liners or monitoring and have done little when contamination was discovered, she said. Of the 39 sites analyzed, 35 had groundwater monitoring wells on the grounds of the waste-disposal area. All of them showed concentration of heavy metals that exceeded federal health standards. The other four had only water-monitoring data from rivers or lakes where the waste sites discharged water. Scientists found contamination that damaged aquatic life. The new report, following a previous study by the environmental groups and EPA's own tally, brings the number of contaminated coal-waste sites to 137 in 34 states.

Jennifer A. Dlouhy, Hearst NewspapersCaptionClose The Environmental Protection Agency's declaration Friday that greenhouse gases endanger the public paves the way for new federal regulations for cars, power plants and factories that spew pollutants blamed for climate change. The agency's proposed finding, set to be finalized after a 60-day review period, also intensifies pressure on Congress to pass legislation with new limits on the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases."The EPA is demonstrating that it will act expeditiously to address climate change," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. "This is a major reversal of Bush administration policy." The EPA concluded Friday that there is overwhelming and compelling evidence that "greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations" by spurring climate change that can lead to rising sea levels, more wildfires and degraded air quality. The endangerment finding applies to carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases, including hydrofluorocarbons and methane. The EPA's move was compelled by a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that greenhouse gases qualified as pollutants under the Clean Air Act and could be regulated if the government decided they threaten the public. But the EPA under former President George W. Bush did not make a determination about greenhouse gases.Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., the head of the House Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, called the EPA's ruling "a game changer." "It now changes the playing field" for lawmakers, who recognize that some regulation of the pollutants is inevitable, even if Congress doesn't act, Markey said. The only question is whether the limits would be imposed solely by the EPA or set by lawmakers on Capitol Hill. "It is now no longer a choice between doing a (climate change) bill or doing nothing," Markey said. "It is now a choice between regulation and legislation." Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who chairs the Senate committee dealing with climate legislation, agreed. She called the decision "a wake-up call for Congress." If Congress doesn't move, Boxer said she would press EPA to take swift action.Environmentalists cheered the EPA finding and said it demonstrates that the Obama administration is committed to combatting climate change.Obama's EPA is "putting science back in its rightful place at the forefront of environmental policy" and "has embraced the basic facts on global warming that scientists around the world have acknowledged for years," said Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas, an environmental advocacy group. "Common sense prevailed over pressure from 'big oil' and other big polluters to deny the obvious in order to maintain the status quo on energy." The finding is the first step toward EPA regulation of greenhouse gases. The agency likely would begin with cars and trucks, which produce about 30 percent of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions, before moving on to stationery sources, such as power plants and industrial operations.Congress, which is in the early stage of a debate over broad energy and climate change proposals, could pre-empt federal regulations by enacting new emissions limits and allowing oil refineries, manufacturers and other industrial operations to comply with the limits by buying and selling emissions allowances. Business leaders warned that the EPA's finding - and nationwide emissions limits - could devastate the already ailing U.S. economy, and give a competitive advantage to manufacturers in countries that do not set similar limits. EPA "regulations could impose complex, costly requirements on restaurants, colleges, schools, shopping malls, bakeries and many other businesses and institutions," said Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute. He called the Clean Air Act "fundamentally ill-suited to addressing the challenge of global climate change."Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she is disappointed by the EPA action. "Placing a mandatory cap on carbon emissions has serious implications for every corner of our already fragile economy," Murkowski said. "The Clean Air Act was not designed to address carbon emissions, and is, at best, a very blunt instrument."Charles Drevna, president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, said that if the EPA decides to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, it would be a huge "assertion of authority over the U.S. economy and Americans' lifestyles." "Before moving forward with regulation, the United States must ensure that other major global contributors are similarly committed to reducing their ambient greenhouse gas concentrations," Drevna said. Otherwise, "American economic competitiveness would be compromised."

Juliet Eilperin, Washington Post2004-05-23 04:00:00 PDT Washington -- After nearly 30 years, the federal government has little to show for its efforts to reduce the haze that obscures the views at many national parks, a problem that was singled out for attention in 1977 under the Clean Air Act. Saying it was time for results, the Bush administration took aim at the matter last month, issuing a regulation that requires power plants and other polluters to install technology to curb emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, the two main contributors to the smog that often shrouds spectacular vistas in an impenetrable brown cloud. But no sooner was it announced than the regulation became mired in controversy, with environmentalists saying the watered-down rule would have little effect. It is an accusation the Environmental Protection Agency rejects. "What the administration's doing with regard to regional haze, we're charging down the road," said William Wehrum, counsel to the assistant administrator for air and radiation at the EPA. The picture is complicated, however, by an agreement that EPA Administrator Michael Leavitt forged with GOP North Dakota Gov. John Hoeven to let the state change how it measures air quality, a deal that environmentalists said would torpedo efforts to reduce the worsening haze at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, known for its rugged view of the North Dakota Badlands. This pact, signed on Feb. 24, sparked a rare outcry from most of EPA's own specialists in air quality monitoring, who warned in a memo that the substantial changes allowed under the agreement would underestimate the impact of air pollution and could set a precedent that would undermine cleanup efforts in other regions. After taking stock of the administration's recent actions, environmentalists argue the end result will be little or no improvement in the vistas at the Great Smoky Mountains and many other iconic national parks. "Clearly, in North Dakota and in some of its national policy decisions there's an urgent need to redouble our efforts to protect national parks and other vital ecosystems from air pollution," said Vickie Patton, a senior attorney at Environmental Defense. "They're letting some of these high- polluting sources off the hook." John Stanton of the National Environmental Trust said, "Twenty-seven years ago, Congress told EPA to prevent the further deterioration in air quality. EPA really hasn't done a thing." The current dispute -- which has drawn in at least one Democratic senator as well as numerous environmentalists -- highlights the contentious debate over air quality and visibility in national parks that attract millions of visitors a year. Under ideal conditions, visibility from peaks in parks such as Shenandoah, Acadia and the Great Smoky Mountains should be more than 100 miles. But the year-round average at Shenandoah hovers closer to 25 miles, dipping to 15 miles during the summer. EPA monitoring data show that smog levels have increased and that visibility has worsened in parks including Bryce Canyon in Utah, Big Bend in Texas and the Great Smoky Mountains, along with others in Colorado, Utah, Idaho and Wyoming. Most haze is caused by fine particles of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, which become suspended in the atmosphere. Coal-fired plants account for most of the smog in Eastern national parks and wilderness areas; in the West, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and carbon monoxide -- often from cars and trucks -- are the primary culprits. Part of the controversy involves disagreements over which set of clean- air rules should be invoked to tackle the haze problem. On April 16, EPA announced that power plants contributing to visibility impairment would have to adopt "best available retrofit technology," or BART, by 2018 or prove that the cost of compliance was too high. "Regional haze is a national problem caused by multiple sources over a wide area," the agency said, adding that reducing haze would have other benefits: "The same pollution that causes haze also poses serious health risks for people with chronic respiratory illnesses." But critics of the administration say EPA may be undermining its own initiative by letting polluters rely on a different Clean Air regulation, the Interstate Air Quality Rule, to address fine-particle pollution. That approach -- which the agency is vetting for public comment -- will not translate into quick cuts in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, they argue. The rule gives power plants in the East the ability to trade pollution credits. The utility industry has fought the BART rule in court, seeking to head it off altogether. The industry scored a partial win in circuit court but is still under federal order to reduce emissions. Quin Shea, executive director for the environment at the Edison Electric Institute, said the industry would prefer to see the Interstate Air Quality Rule adopted rather than BART, calling the regulation "an appropriate surrogate for the electric power sector." He said the interstate rule, which calls for a two-thirds reduction in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, is "excellent at meeting a first milestone for visibility." Air quality has been diminishing in many national parks, according to a study completed by Colorado State University in May 2000 that found that vistas deteriorated in Badlands, Big Bend and Great Smoky Mountains national parks, among others. The National Parks Conservation Association, a leading critic of EPA's efforts to tackle haze over the years, also challenges the administration's time line for reducing haze, which sets a final target 60 years from now. Joy Oakes, the group's mid-Atlantic regional director, called that far-off goal "fairly ridiculous." EPA's Wehrum said the agency hopes to make reasonable progress of 15 percent clearer air every decade. "From a technical standpoint, it's a very complex problem to work your way through," he said. Critics who question the administration's commitment are pointing to the accord EPA accepted for Theodore Roosevelt Park in North Dakota, which allows the state to choose what year to use as the baseline for measuring air-quality trends and to count average emissions over the entire year, rather than peak emissions. EPA's own specialists in measuring air quality trends wrote that the agreement marked "substantial changes from past air quality modeling guidance . .. and accepted methods." However, it drew the praise of Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. "The air in North Dakota is exceptionally clear," said Conrad, who says the agreement will promote economic development in his home state. "I do believe what happened in North Dakota was an appropriate outcome."

Eric Pianin, Washington Post2003-04-15 04:00:00 PDT Washington -- The Environmental Protection Agency launched an expedited investigation Monday of a chemical compound widely used for decades in manufacturing cookware, clothing, cosmetics and scores of other products to determine whether it poses a health risk to women of childbearing age and young girls. The chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), is toxic and persistent in the environment and has been detected at low levels in the bloodstreams of the vast majority of humans tested for it. There's been growing concern about the effects of this compound for several years, but Monday's announcement suggested the government was taking the problem more seriously and eventually might regulate the chemical. EPA officials became highly concerned late last year after reviewing a study by 3M, which once manufactured PFOA. It found that laboratory rats exposed to the synthetic chemical lost weight and experienced delayed sexual maturation and that an inordinate number of their offspring died prematurely. Now, officials say they're conducting the most extensive scientific assessment yet of the perfluorochemical family to determine whether the substances may cause comparable sexual reproductive and developmental damage to women and girls. PFOA has also been linked to testicular, liver and pancreatic cancer in animals, and EPA officials will investigate whether the chemical may be carcinogenic in humans. "The fact that PFOA is present in humans is of interest and concern to us," said Stephen Johnson, assistant administrator of EPA's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. "How the levels in humans do or don't relate to the laboratory animal effects we are seeing is what we're trying to sort out." Johnson and other EPA officials cautioned that there was much they didn't understand about the effects of PFOA and that the EPA might be many months away from determining whether the chemical posed an unreasonable public risk. Sensitive to the potential economic effects the investigation could have on the multibillion-dollar perfluorochemical industry, Johnson repeatedly told reporters "the EPA does not believe there is any reason for consumers to stop using any consumer or industrial related products." Until recent years, the EPA paid relatively scant attention to the chemical, which is used to produce such brands as Teflon, Stainmaster, Scotchgard and Gore-Tex, despite environmentalists' warnings that it might eventually rival DDT, PCBs and dioxin as a dangerous global chemical contaminant. "The public should have known about problems with this Teflon chemical 30 years ago," said Kris Thayer, senior scientist for the Washington-based Environmental Working Group. "What's outrageous is that the law governing toxic chemicals allows DuPont and other big companies to pollute our blood and environment first, and get around to asking basic scientific questions decades later." DuPont, based in Delaware, and three other overseas chemical companies currently manufacture PFOA, which is used as a processing aid in the manufacture of substances that keeps food from sticking to pots and pans, repels stains on furniture and rugs, and makes rain roll off coats. Industry makes use of the slippery, heat-stable properties of these chemicals to manufacture everything from airplanes and computers to cell phones, cosmetics and household cleaners. On Monday, DuPont reaffirmed its position that there's no evidence indicating adverse human health effects related to low levels of exposure to "We share the EPA desire to safeguard human health and the environment and respect the position that there are still questions to be addressed," said Richard Angiullo, vice president and general manager for DuPont Fluoroproducts. In May 2000, 3M Co. announced that it would stop making many of its well- known Scotchgard stain-repellent products after finding that one of the chemical compounds used to make the products -- perfluorooctane sulfonate -- persists in the environment and is found widely in the bloodstreams of people worldwide. 3M also stopped manufacturing PFOA, leaving the U.S. market to DuPont.

Noaki Schwartz, Associated Press The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is taking over the cleanup of an oil spill in Santa Barbara County after failed efforts by Greka Oil & Gas Inc., a company whose long record of inland oil spills could soon prompt legislation.Officials announced the federal takeover of the Bell lease site in Santa Maria on Tuesday, saying Greka has not removed petroleum-contaminated soil in a creek in the two months since the spill.Greka, which state officials have called California's worst inland oil polluter, has been responsible for three spills at the site since last summer totaling more than 29,000 gallons of crude oil and toxin-laden water."That they're federalizing this is a big deal," said Steve Edinger, assistant chief of the state Department of Fish and Game. "It's basically the EPA saying, 'We need to step in and make sure the environment is taken care of and cleaned up.' It's not something that happens very often."In a statement issued later Tuesday, Greka contended the EPA's assessment was inaccurate and misleading. Greka said it replaced its original contractor with another environmental cleanup company but the EPA rejected that company's health and safety plan. "The bottom line: EPA's hasty actions have prevented Greka from quickly and efficiently completing the cleanup," said the statement issued through Sitrick and Co., a public relations firm hired by Greka.Robert Wise, who works at EPA's Superfund division, scoffed at the idea that Greka, headed by Randeep Grewal, does not have sufficient funds."There's really no question as to whether Randy Grewal has the money - oh yeah, he has the money," Wise said. "The question is whether he wants to pay for this."While Greka is one of the smallest producers in the state, Grewal's business interests are international. Grewal also oversees Greka China and its subsidiary Green Dragon Gas, which reportedly paid $35.2 million in cash recently to acquire a Canadian natural resource company. Though the companies share the same Greka Web site, officials insist they are separate entities.Greka started operations in Santa Maria in 1999, taking over aging facilities from major oil companies and turning crude into asphalt and other products. Local, state and federal officials have said the company has not spent enough money to improve the facilities - something the company disputes.Broken pumps and pipes and cracked tanks at Greka installations have led to spills totaling more than a half-million gallons of oil and contaminated water over the years. The Santa Barbara County Fire Department has responded at least 400 times to Greka oil spills and gas leaks, resulting in fines, citations, federal and local prosecutions, and EPA investigations.Over the next two weeks, state legislators are rolling out several bills that are a direct result of Greka's activities.The bills would provide more resources to clean up inland spills, create an escalating series of fines for repeat violators and create minimum standards at inland oil facilities that state agencies could enforce.Assemblyman Pedro Nava, D-Santa Barbara, contends there has been a lack of initiative by the county Board of Supervisors, which has allowed Greka to continue operating for nearly a decade despite the spills.Nava said the new laws would give state agencies more authority to deal with inland spills."If you have a situation where a county delays its actions, the state will be empowered to take the appropriate action," he said.

Dina Cappiello, Associated PressCaptionClose The Environmental Protection Agency moved for the first time Wednesday to control the emissions from the power plants, factories and refineries that are blamed for global warming.The announcement came hours after Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, unveiled legislation that would set mandatory, nationwide limits on the amount of greenhouse gases from large industrial sources. Backed by President Obama, the EPA's proposal would require polluters to reduce six greenhouse gases by installing the best available technology and improving energy efficiency whenever a facility is significantly changed or built. The rule applies to any industrial plant that emits at least 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases a year.These large sources are responsible for 70 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions - mainly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels - that are released in the United States, the EPA said."By using the power and authority of the Clean Air Act, we can begin reducing emissions from the nation's largest greenhouse gas emitting facilities without placing an undue burden on the businesses that make up the vast majority of our economy," EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said. "We know the corner coffee shop is no place to look for meaningful carbon reductions."Earlier this year, the Obama administration announced that it would start developing the first-ever greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and trucks. Those regulations, which would take effect in 2010, compel the EPA to control greenhouse gases from large smokestacks as well, the agency said.Industry groups immediately questioned the agency's argument. They charged that the EPA was skirting the law because the Clean Air Act typically covers any facility releasing more than 250 tons a year of a recognized pollutant. That threshold would require more facilities to fall under the new regulations."This proposal incorrectly assumes that one industry's greenhouse gas emissions are worse than another's," said Charles T. Drevna, president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association.Jeff Holmstead, a former top EPA air pollution official who is now a lobbyist for the energy industry, said the agency was trying to "fit a square peg into a round hole.""Normally, it takes an act of Congress to change the words of a statute enacted by Congress, and many of us are very curious to see EPA's legal justification for today's proposal," Holmstead said.Jackson, speaking at a news conference in Los Angeles at a climate change summit hosted by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said the rule was legally defensible."The EPA would not propose a rule that we didn't believe ... made good legal sense," she said.The agency's move could push lawmakers in Congress to reach agreement and could show America's resolve to curb emissions in advance of U.N. talks in Copenhagen later this year that are aimed at producing an international agreement to combat global warming.The Senate climate bill introduced Wednesday, unlike the House-passed version, preserves the EPA's authority to regulate under the Clean Air Act. Environmentalists said the two efforts go hand in hand."You can't have one without the other if we're going to be successful in moving America to clean energy," said Emily Figdor, director of the global warming program at Environment America, an advocacy group.The bill would cut the nation's greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2020 and cover roughly 7,500 coal-fired plants, oil refineries and other facilities across the country.The measure resembles the House-passed bill in many respects, though it is slightly more ambitious in terms of its environmental targets and it fleshes out aspects of the carbon-trading market that would be created under a system where carbon emitters will buy and sell pollution allowances. It creates what Boxer described as "a soft collar" that aims to curb price volatility in the carbon allowance trading market.Under the House bill, new coal plants would have to slash their emissions by 50 percent from now until 2020. Coal plants would not be able to comply with such limits without capturing emissions and storing them underground, experts say. California, by comparison, forbids new coal plants unless they reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to the level of a power plant burning natural gas.

Kelly ZitoCaptionClosePROPOSAL: The governor's revised proposal is a one-time transaction that would take $48.7 million from the Air Quality Improvement Fund to help refit heavy equipment and vehicles that pollute heavily. WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU: The refitting is designed to reduce air pollution from diesel trucks and buses, which air quality experts say produce some of the highest levels of cancer-causing soot in California. In particular, small businesses that have diesel trucks, buses or other heavy mobile equipment would get financial help in replacing or updating their vehicles to pollute less in advance of state regulations curbing greenhouse gas emissions.REACTION: "The idea is to provide grants, loans and loan guarantees ... to help retrofit ahead of regulatory deadlines," said Bonnie Holms-Ven, senior policy director of the American Lung Association's California chapter. "We think it's an important investment in state funds to reduce this toxic threat."

Tracy Wilkinson, Los Angeles Times2000-07-21 04:00:00 PDT Haifa, Israel -- It's the smell of the Kishon River that first hits you, long before the murky, oily waters are visible. Yuval Tamir spent years diving dutifully into those waters, inhaling the smell, absorbing the toxins that he believes contributed to the two cancers that he suffers from today. Tamir belonged to an elite sea combat unit, the Jewish state's equivalent of U.S. Navy SEALS. Like hundreds of other divers, he trained in the Kishon, a river that seemingly everyone has always known was the most polluted in the country, ringed as it is by refineries and chemical plants. Tamir remembers how the Kishon felt, the way it burned the skin. It took 40 minutes with caustic horse soap to remove the river water from his skin after every dive. But the worst part was the taste. Sometimes you accidentally swallowed some of the water, or were forced to drink it as punishment meted out by an angry commander. Tamir can't forget that taste, though it's been 14 years since his last dive. A taste somewhere between chemicals and sewage that seemed to corrode the insides of his body in ways even harsher than the chemotherapy he endures today. Tamir is one of a growing number of former navy combat divers who trained in the Kishon and who have come forward now to report cancers and strange illnesses -- and to ask questions. He and two other former divers, as well as the widow of a fourth, have sued the government and the military in the Israeli Supreme Court, alleging that authorities were refusing to conduct a meaningful investigation of the Kishon pollution and instead were trying to whitewash any attempts to probe the matter. In response, and as publicity surrounding the case mounted, the government hastily appointed a blue-ribbon panel headed by a former Supreme Court justice to investigate the claims. It is highly unusual for the Israeli military to submit to civilian scrutiny, and Tamir and the other plaintiffs are waiting to see how the investigation is conducted. A country besieged by its neighbors and focused on its very survival, Israel has only in recent years begun to pay much attention to the ecological devastation that rapid development has wrought. Environmental experts say Israel is 15 years behind the United States in efforts to clean up its dirty air, water and land. But the outcry over the Kishon is being raised not by environmentalists or fringe activists but by quintessential Israeli patriots -- men who fought for their country and now wonder about an insidious, unseen hazard that might have put their lives at risk. Tamir's story was first reported in the top-selling daily Yediot Ahronot. The newspaper has since documented an additional 30 cases of former divers who contracted cancer. All of the men reported receiving a diagnosis of cancer at a relatively young age -- 35 to 45 -- and said they had been in good health and exceptionally physically fit until that point. All had gone diving in the Kishon. The Kishon River traverses part of northern Israel and empties into Haifa Bay on the Mediterranean, skirting the city of Haifa, the most heavily industrialized urban center in the country. Chemical plants, oil refineries, an electrical power plant, the world's largest producer of potassium nitrate fertilizer and Haifa's entire sewage system have been dumping sludge into the river virtually unabated for decades. Only in the last five years, forced by court orders and a landmark lawsuit from the Israeli Union for Environmental Defense, have measures been taken by some of the factories to reduce the level of heavy metals and other poisons coursing through their effluence. The water today, while less contaminated than 10 or 15 years ago, still contains levels of known carcinogens such as cadmium, benzene and toluene, according to toxicology experts. Training dives in the Kishon, like the ones Tamir participated in, weren't stopped until the early 1990s. Operational dives, to repair the hulls of ships and other maintenance, continued until May, when the army ordered them suspended after the initial Yediot reports. Tamir's unit is among the most exclusive clubs within the military. Its ranks represent the pinnacle of derring-do, sacrifice and glory. The men who trained in the Kishon went on some of the Israeli navy's most spectacular secret missions, including forays into the Bay of Beirut during Israel's war in Lebanon in the early 1980s. Practicing demolition operations, laying charges, retrieving equipment, staging sea-to-shore raids -- all the training done in the Kishon was vital to the unit's mission, the divers say today. Divers needed the turbid blackness that the polluted water provided: The pollution and underwater clutter are the frogman's camouflage. The divers knew they were being prepared for potentially deadly missions, so no one asked questions. The filth and stench of the water seemed the least of their worries at the time, even though some men fainted from the fumes wafting through the air. Told to go into the gunk, they went. Dr. Yonah Amitai, president of the Israeli Society of Toxicology and an official with the Health Ministry, said a causal relationship between the toxins of the Kishon and the divers' cancers cannot be determined until each case, including the personal and family medical histories, is examined. But, he said, the severity of the river pollution, the men's prolonged, unprotected exposure and the number of cases all point to a connection. "It seems from the numbers quoted that there is an excess of cancer cases," Amitai said. "The overall information (raises) concern that this is not due to chance." Tamir dived regularly in the Kishon for a decade ending in 1986. The military's reluctance to acknowledge the problem and take care of the sick is what most disturbs him. "To serve in the unit is to do everything because you want to be the best," he said. "The army always tells you they will do everything for you if you are hurt. But now we are bleeding on the battlefield, and they have left us behind." Tamir, who was treated for colon cancer and recently developed skin cancer, now must decide whether to send his draft-age son into the navy to fulfill his compulsory military duty. It would have been a no-brainer a few years ago, but now Tamir thinks twice. The former diver recently toured the Kishon with a reporter, pointing out the areas where he once plunged into the opaque green waters with a team of underwater combat specialists. Parts of the river were slimy and bubbling. Large pipes could be seen spilling black water into the river, which gave off a harsh chemical smell. Fish haven't lived in the Kishon for years. Dead jellyfish float in between the boats in the harbor. "Everything dies here," Tamir said.

Jane Kay, Environmental Health NewsCaptionClose Hilmar Cheese Co., one of the world's largest cheese producers, is responsible for spoiling neighbors' drinking water wells, new documents show.For two decades, the cheese factory midway between Sacramento and Fresno has battled state pollution regulators, and this year it won permission to increase the amount of salty, mineral-rich wastewater dumped on surrounding fields.Now, much of the well water isn't fit to drink. State officials say the company is the likely culprit in ruining at least 18 wells in and around Hilmar. High in nitrates, arsenic, barium and salts, the well water tastes bad and violates federal health standards.The story of Hilmar is a classic tale of a company growing rapidly, bringing well-paying jobs but also environmental threats to a rural farm community. However, these are not corporate outsiders pitted against town residents; the owners of Hilmar Cheese are descendants of the community's founding families.Rita and John Sanders and their son, Curry, are one of the families that have lost wells to pollution. Fourth-generation residents of Hilmar, they were driven off part of their land more than a decade ago by a contaminated well. They moved to the family farmhouse. Now that well is contaminated, too."This pollution has become the evil of the town, and they don't know how to stop it," said Rita Sanders, whose great-uncle built the first house in Hilmar. "This water used to be so good. It's not that way anymore."Partially treated, salty, mineral-laden leftovers from making cheese were discharged onto land around the sprawling 27-acre plant. The effluent, sometimes having stood for days, seeped into the groundwater. In addition, a former Hilmar Cheese employee said he and other workers routinely dumped acids and other hazardous cleaning materials on the ground along with the effluent."Hilmar Cheese was in violation of our waste-discharge requirements, and it polluted that shallow groundwater," said Lonnie Wass, a supervising engineer at the regional water-quality board in Fresno. A report released in June by the company's consultants concluded that the plant is the likely source of contamination in six wells, two owned by the company. In 12 other wells, the evidence points to the plant as the primary source. The investigators cite another 24 wells where they cannot yet discern the source - and more wells are still under study.Drinking arsenic increases the risk of cancer of the bladder, lungs, skin and other organs. Nitrates can harm fetuses and infants, causing life-threatening "blue baby syndrome," when a baby's blood cannot carry adequate oxygen.The company agrees with its consultants' conclusion that the plant has contaminated some residents' wells.Burton Fleischer, Hilmar Cheese's environmental director, said the company is "in an investigation phase" with the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board. The company spent $178 million between 2001 and 2010 trying to treat the wastewater, he said. "If there are any past impacts, they will be addressed," Fleischer said.Home to pickup trucks hauling horse trailers and hay bales, 4-square-mile Hilmar has a population of 3,900 in a region hit hard by agricultural unemployment. With 780 jobs, Hilmar Cheese is the economic lifeblood of Hilmar, where the median household earns $52,000 - $9,000 below California's average.The Chamber of Commerce boasts of Hilmar's perfect location, "One Hundred Miles from Anywhere," including San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean, the scenic Sierra Nevada and the valley metropolises of Fresno and Sacramento.On the outskirts of Hilmar, the cheese plant grew from producing 500,000 pounds of Monterey jack, cheddar and other cheeses per day in 1994 to 1.4 million pounds per day in 2010. The company's revenue is estimated at more than $1 billion a year.Over 20 years, Hilmar Cheese has objected to pollutant limits and enforcement actions proposed by the regional board. The Sacramento Bee in 2004 revealed that Hilmar Cheese's thousands of violations over nearly 16 years went without fines. The company settled in 2006, paying a $1 million fine and $1.8 million toward environmental studies.The plant supplies bottled water to about a dozen homes, ranches and offices. But many families still have to wash clothes and dishes and take showers in well water so high in salts that it leaves a residue of white chunky crystals. Their livestock and other animals also drink the well water.Last month, the Sanders family discovered that its house well contains arsenic, nitrates, barium and high salts. Arsenic was found at 13 parts per billion compared with the Environmental Protection Agency's standard of 10 parts per billion, while nitrates at 21 parts per million are more than twice the federal maximum level. So far, the well remains in the "cannot discern the source" category, according to the company's report.The well water was fine before Hilmar Cheese started dumping its wastewater on fields 15 feet from their property line, John and Rita Sanders said."This was the nastiest stuff you ever saw," John Sanders, a truck driver and former bull rider, said. "It smelled like dirty diapers - 24 hours a day, seven days a week."In 1997, a Hilmar Cheese drainpipe leaked, and water pooled on the Sanderses' property for about two weeks until it was fixed. First the family noticed the odd taste and smell of its well water. The water pitted holes in the clothes in the washing machine. After they took showers, their skin felt as though it were burning."I had to put lotion on our young son to stop the burning," Rita Sanders said. Healthy trees planted to mark his first few Christmases all of a sudden died. That's when they moved to the family farmhouse where they now live. One by one, many of the residents' wells have gone bad. The pattern has been that family owners of Hilmar Cheese buy the land and people move away.Across the street from the Sanders family, a well owned by Atwater High School Principal Alan Peterson tested high in salts with elevated levels of arsenic and barium. In early 2000, he used the well to sprinkle 40 acres of almond trees that he'd planted. The trunks and lower branches began to turn whitish, probably from salts, which can stunt growth. In 2004, Peterson sold to the Nyman brothers, a founding family of Hilmar Cheese. Wastewater overflowed onto Maria Chavarin's property. She had two wells, one contaminated with arsenic, both with high levels of total dissolved solids, or salts, which indicate invasion by discharge waters, according to state officials. Hilmar Cheese officials said they bought her land this year. Dolores Tagges, a resident for 40 years, can no longer leave her windows open at night or hang her clothes on the line because of the smell. She has four wells on the 34 acres her late husband's family bought in the early 1950s. "Before Hilmar Cheese came in, we didn't worry about the water," she said.This year, some scientists on the board's staff asked to redo the company's permit, issued in January, because they felt it was too lax. The board rejected their concerns. Hilmar Cheese is now under a state order to clean up waste discharges by February. Under its new permit, the company puts the waste through a membrane-filter system, then runs it onto land, although it must meet monthly averages for nitrogen, salts and other pollutants. The residue caught by the membrane, along with toxic cleaning chemicals, is injected into the deep aquifer at 3,200 feet.The California Sportfishing Protection Alliance has filed the first step toward a lawsuit challenging the permit, saying it allows the continuing degradation of ground water.John Grace, who grew up in Hilmar and worked at the plant in the 1990s, recalled that everybody bragged about how fast Hilmar Cheese was growing compared with other plants. "But they had no restriction on their wastewater. You look at the other producers. All of the drain waters ran under extreme stipulations of how much they were allowed to dump and what they were allowed to dump," Grace said.Grace said he was told to dump cleaning chemicals - caustics and acids - along with the wastewater used for irrigation.He said Hilmar is a "good ol' boy town" where people don't want to make trouble for the company."In 20 years, Hilmar Cheese is going to pollute almost all of Hilmar and the surrounding area. After awhile, the ground is saturated. It can only take so much," he said. Fleischer of Hilmar Cheese said it's taken more than a decade to find an adequate way to treat the wastewater because wastes from making cheese, whey protein and lactose powder are unique."We're innovative. No one in California does what we do in the way that we do it," Fleischer said. "You don't know how it's going to work until you've tried it. That takes money, and that takes time."For more on this story, including a photo slide show, go to www.environmentalhealthnews.org.

By Peter FimriteCaptionClose The creeping plume of chemically laced drinking water that plagued the Mojave Desert town of Hinkley and led to a major motion picture about the scandal has continued to spread despite a long-standing order for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to clean up the mess. Higher than normal levels of cancer-causing hexavalent chromium, or chromium 6, have been detected over the past year in groundwater more than a half-mile beyond the previous boundary of contamination in the San Bernardino County farming community, water quality regulators revealed last week.  The toxic spillage at a PG&E facility southeast of Hinkley was first exposed by Erin Brockovich, a paralegal at a Southern California firm whose court battle on behalf of sickened residents against the giant utility was recounted in a 2000 movie starring Julia Roberts.  Representatives of PG&E said the levels of chromium 6 in the new location were never above California's safe drinking water standard and have recently been reduced to natural background levels. Still, many farmers and ranchers in the area are angry that the tainted water remains a threat two decades after PG&E stopped discharging the chemical. "The plume is migrating, and this is a violation of the cleanup order," said Carmela Gonzalez, one of many residents of Hinkley who is demanding action. "It is outrageous that this has been allowed to continue. People are fed up."Hexavalent chromium was used by PG&E between 1952 and 1966 to fight corrosion in the cooling towers at a compressor station about 12 miles west of Barstow. The wastewater from the cooling towers was discharged into unlined ponds. Some of the contaminated runoff percolated into the groundwater, polluting a 2-mile-long, nearly mile-wide portion of the aquifer.Dozens of townsfolk reported falling sick, and some allegedly died from exposure to the carcinogen. Breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, lung, brain and gastrointestinal cancers, miscarriages, and kidney and ovarian tumors were blamed on the poisoned water. The utility was ordered to clean up the water after a legal battle spearheaded by Brockovich. The film "Erin Brockovich" focused on a 1996 case that ended with a $333 million settlement on behalf of more than 600 Hinkley residents. Other lawsuits involving 1,100 people exposed to chromium 6 from PG&E facilities in Kings, Riverside and San Bernardino counties were also settled, the last one for $20 million in 2008.At that time, the utility appeared to have controlled the spread of the chromium 6 in Hinkley. Then a local farmer with water rights north of the PG&E facility began a pumping operation that experts believe sucked the plume northward. The Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board, which oversees the Hinkley area, issued a cleanup and abatement order in August 2008, instructing PG&E to stop the expansion of the underground chromium plume by Dec. 31 of that year.  The plume nevertheless continued spreading. It is now 2.6 miles long and 1.3 miles wide and extends 0.6 miles farther northeast than it did two years ago, said Lisa Dernbach, the senior engineering geologist for the water board. Dernbach said increased levels of chromium have recently been detected in about 12 domestic drinking water wells. That's in addition to the dozens of wells previously affected. Not only that, Dernbach said, but chromium has also been found in what she called "the lower aquifer," an area of groundwater separated from the upper aquifer by a layer of clay. "This is important," she said, "because the pollution originally affected only the upper aquifer, and a lot of the domestic wells were tapped into the lower aquifer because it was believed to be uncontaminated."Reports of sick and dying residents continue, including the deaths of three people who Gonzalez said once lived in a house that PG&E purchased and demolished - two died from cancer - but there is no direct evidence of a link between the reported health problems and chromium 6. Lahontan officials have not slapped PG&E with a notice of violation, a common enforcement tool.  "In this case the enforcement committee decided that a verbal enforcement action to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. was appropriate in part because PG&E was cooperative and working to develop a plan to address the violation, which they have since implemented," said Chuck Curtis, the supervising engineer for the water quality control board.Bob Doss, PG&E's principal engineer for gas transmission and distribution remediation, said the chromium plume has been expanding and contracting for years, but is, for the most part, corralled. The trick now, he said, is to move forward with a PG&E action plan that was recently submitted to the Lahontan board. The proposal is to reduce chromium levels to naturally occurring background levels of less than 3.2 parts per billion. A series of hydraulic and biological methods are being used, Doss said, including the injection of ethanol into the groundwater, a process that converts hexavalent chromium into trivalent chromium, which is not harmful.  PG&E is also growing feed crops like alfalfa using contaminated water, a process that essentially filters out the chromium 6, at a utility-owned dairy."The goal, quite simply put, is to continue to use our agricultural treatment in the one area and expand that into other areas," Doss said. "It's a natural beneficial use that makes a lot of sense. It dilutes the plume." The highest concentration of chromium found in a resident's well over the past year has been about 14 parts per billion, according to Dernbach. The state drinking water standard for chromium is 50 parts per billion. The most toxic area, at the source of the plume, has a concentration of 9,030 parts per billion of total chromium, Dernbach said.  One issue is that the standards do not specifically single out chromium 6, which is one of many forms of chromium. The California Department of Public Health does not currently have a standard for chromium 6 in drinking water, but last year the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment proposed a ceiling of 0.06 parts per billion.  That standard, if it eventually gets approved, would mean that virtually all of the well water in the Hinkley Valley is unsafe to drink. "Here you have a community that is suffering because their wells have been contaminated, and PG&E hasn't even received a violation," Gonzalez said. "California needs to know that this plume is growing. Erin Brockovich didn't fix it, and Hinkley residents aren't getting justice."Brockovich, whose law firm said she was out of the country, did not respond to an e-mail about the expanding chromium plume.

Joan KruckewittCaptionClose2005-12-11 04:00:00 PDT Taracoa, Ecuador -- On the porch of an Amazonian village store, a shirtless man flicks a rag at flies. "Does Maruja Garrido live here?" we ask. No answer. He raises his eyes, then flicks his rag again. A woman in a pink dress appears beside him. "Yes?" she asks warily, peering at us, two foreigners. "We're looking for Maruja Garrido," I say quickly. "We're journalists, looking to interview people who have cancer." Photographer Lou Dematteis and I had just come from the village health center where a doctor had given us her name. The woman's eyes moisten. She hesitates. We wait. Then she motions to her teenage daughter to fetch two plastic chairs, and we are invited to sit on the porch. "I am Maruja, I'm 35, and I'm in the third stage of colon cancer," she says flatly. Then she tells us her story. She has sold her farm to pay the medical bills. Twice, she has taken the serpentine 10-hour bus ride up the Andes Mountains to Quito, the capital, to the only cancer hospital in the country, to have chemotherapy. She is supposed to go every 28 days, and, after chemotherapy, she'll start radiation. Her doctors won't tell her what her chances are; they just tell her to return. "My husband had an accident. He can't work now, he's deaf. I have five children, and I run our store. If something happens to me ... ." She doesn't finish the sentence. Her husband, the shirtless man, wanders over to look at us. Their children cluster around the counter. A customer comes inside and buys a Coke, then stays to listen. Maruja's story is typical of those we heard as we searched one year ago for people with cancer in the Oriente, the Amazonian region of Ecuador. The story goes back to 1967, when Texaco, a U.S. oil company that now is part of Chevron, discovered oil in northeastern Ecuador. Between 1971 and 1992 Texaco, in partnership with state-owned PetroEcuador, extracted more than 1.5 billion barrels of oil from this area. Texaco dug nearly 300 wells, built processing facilities, pumping stations and a refinery. Texaco disposed of wastes from its work in a manner that plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit -- called Aguinda vs. Texaco -- contend is responsible for the area's high rate of cancer, an assertion the oil company disputes. Plaintiffs' attorneys cite a series of health studies in publications such as the International Journal of Epidemiology and the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health. One found that the cancer rate in the oil-drilling area was 150 percent higher than in other parts of Ecuador. Another found that the rate of leukemia in children there was three times higher than in other parts of Ecuador. In 1993, the lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York on behalf of roughly 30,000 Ecuadorians. It claimed that the oil company had polluted their rain forest home and damaged their health by dumping hazardous wastes. The suit, filed by the Philadelphia firm of Kohn, Swift and Graf, seeks $6 billion in cleanup costs. In 2001, Chevron, of San Ramon, acquired Texaco and with it the lawsuit. In 2003, the suit was refiled in Ecuador. Chevron spokesman Jeff Moore recently declined to comment on the lawsuit, but Chevron earlier told The Chronicle that it didn't believe the plaintiffs had "ever provided any substantiated evidence to support their claims." Chevron Chairman David O'Reilly said at last year's annual stockholder meeting that there are undoubtedly health problems in the Amazon, but they should not be blamed on his company. He noted that Texaco spent $40 million cleaning up the region and, in 1998, received a release from further liability from Ecuador's government. Court papers, studies and documents on Chevron's Web site, www.chevron.com, detail the company's contention that oil pollution is not a severe problem in the area and that Texaco's activities were not responsible for residents' sickness. Chevron maintains the main causes of disease in the area include poverty, poor sanitation, lack of access to clean water and naturally occurring bacteria and parasites. Samples taken from some wells, Chevron says, show only contamination from human and animal wastes, which, it notes, can cause illness in humans. But the plaintiffs allege that toxic waste dumped by Texaco into rain forest rivers, wetlands and unlined pits the company dug near their wells polluted the bathing and drinking water of inhabitants, including five indigenous groups -- the Quechua, Siona, Cofan, Secoya and the Huaorani -- and the tens of thousands of settlers who had emigrated from the Andes Mountains, searching for work and land. Maruja Garrido moved to Taracoa as a teenager in the 1980s. "My father's farm had several waste pits on it," she said. "We lived next to a stream, and we had no idea it was contaminated." She said she gathered drinking water from the stream, pushing aside the rainbow-colored film on top and scooping up the "clean" water underneath. She washed the laundry there, sometimes returning home with black-spotted clothes. She ate fish caught from the oily streams. Residents say Texaco also sprayed waste crude on the region's dirt roads to keep the dust down. Many people in the region, too poor to own shoes, walked barefoot on the roads. Maruja carried her shoes so she wouldn't ruin them, then cleaned her feet with diesel fuel. Along the dirt roads run oil pipelines 2 feet in diameter. Occasionally, clearings appear where old oil wells stand idle next to waste pits that bubble and burp in the sun. In the nearby jungle, farmers and their children live. Some of them suffer from cancer or birth defects. Miguel Yumbo, 37, of Rumipamba, a member of the Quechua indigenous group, says his son Jairo's deformed hand is the result of oil pollution. Two of Jairo's fingers are fused together. "The doctors told me he was born like that because we always drank water from an oil-filled stream and because Texaco used to pass by our house spraying crude on the dirt highway," he tells us one afternoon. The waste pits were hazardous for animals. Horses, cows, pigs, dogs and chickens fell into them, the local people say. When animals couldn't be saved, farmers killed them and ate them. Two waste pits, two oil wells and a separation plant surrounded the house of Maria Patiño and her husband, who raised cattle in San Carlos. They couldn't figure out why their cattle miscarried, or, if calves were born, they had diarrhea and died. Later, they came to believe it was from drinking the salty formation waters the plant released into the stream. Texaco's waste dumping sites are spread across an area the size of Rhode Island that contains major rivers that feed into the Amazon River in Brazil. The lawsuit contends that in 20 years of operations in Ecuador, Texaco dumped billions of gallons of toxic wastewater into pits or into rivers. The oil company counters that it spent millions of dollars in cleanup efforts. Modesto Briones, 45, of Parahuaco Dos, believes she got cancer from years of washing clothes in a contaminated river. There are three waste pits within 150 yards of her house. A sore on her toe, she says, developed into a cancerous ulcer, and doctors amputated her leg. "I'm having a hard time now. I no longer leave the house," she tells us. In a year, she has left the house only once, to request an identification card. In 1992, Texaco's concession rights ended, the company pulled out of Ecuador, and its operations reverted to the Ecuadorian state petroleum company. Many of the waste pits were covered with bulldozed trees and dirt. Waste from oil operations contains identified carcinogens and can lead to skin disease, reproductive abnormalities, nerve damage and cancer. The waste is saturated with carcinogens such as benzene, toluene and xylene. In the United States, these pits would probably be a Superfund site. But in this part of the Amazon, waste pits are often closer than the neighbors. Juana Apolo, 53, of Comunidad San Francisco, a cook at a state oil camp, takes us to the whitewashed cemetery where her father, sister and brother are buried. All died of cancer. She says they lived near waste pits. Dolores Morales, 49, of Sacha Central, lived 20 yards from an oil well and 50 yards from a waste pit. Five years ago, doctors discovered that her son, Pedro, 19, had three cancerous tumors: in his lungs, liver and on his leg. He died 10 months later. "He really suffered," she says. "He begged them to amputate his leg, but the cancer had spread. He had a girlfriend. He said he didn't want to die, he wanted to keep on living." Now, Dolores' 15-year old son, Jose, has leukemia. His testicles were removed, and he continues treatments whenever Dolores has money to take him to Quito for checkups. Research links long-term exposure to benzene to leukemia. When photographer Lou Dematteis first visited Luz Maria Marin, 56, she was cradling her husband Angel Toala's head between her hands. He lay, gaunt, unmoving, in a hammock. Some months later, when I visit, Luz Maria is a widow. She slumps in a chair, staring at the floor, crying. "In Quito, they diagnosed him with stomach cancer. The doctors said it was too late. In the last three months before he died, he couldn't do anything, he just lay in the hammock." Texaco's oil well was 200 yards from her house, Luz Maria says. The separation station was nearby, and downstream was a lake where the dumped oil gathered. Dead fish floated in it, she says, and the nearby coffee bushes turned yellow, then died. Back at the village store, Maruja tells us her first symptoms appeared seven years ago, when her head and legs began aching. The pain worsened. Doctors operated on her for an ectopic pregnancy, but she didn't improve. At the cancer hospital in Quito, they finally discovered her tumor and removed it. Treatment is painful and expensive, she says, but, for the sake of her children, she has to continue. "Here in Taracoa, so many people have died from cancer," Maruja says. "Two people were just buried, and two more are about to die." She begins to cry. "I'm waiting to see what God decides -- whether or not he will give me life. If not, well then, I may leave this world, even though it's before my time."  An exhibit, "Crude Reflections: ChevronTexaco's Rainforest Legacy," features the work of photographers Lou Dematteis and Kayana Szymczak, and writer Joan Kruckewitt, including some of the photographs shown here. It is on display until Dec. 30 at San Francisco City Hall. The show is sponsored by the city's Arts Commission Gallery and is supported by numerous groups, including Amazon Watch, an environmental advocacy group, which sponsored a similar exhibit last spring in San Ramon. Donations for medical expenses of residents of Ecuador's upper Amazon basin can be sent to: Peace/Amazon Medical Fund, 3201 Camino Tassajara, Danville, CA 94506.

Julie N. Lynem, Chronicle Staff WriterCaptionClose1999-01-27 04:00:00 PDT SANFRANCISCO -- The captain and chief engineer of the Liberian-registered tanker accused of dumping oil that soiled the San Mateo County coast were arrested yesterday when they voluntarily returned to the United States. Captain Dimitrios Georgantas, 50, and chief engineer Lampros Karaganis, 52, were taken into custody by Coast Guard and immigration officials when they arrived at San Francisco International Airport on a flight from London, according to attorneys for the two men. The pair is expected to appear before a federal magistrate in San Francisco today. Both men and the vessel's owner, Pearl Shipping Company, were indicted by a federal grand jury last month for knowingly discharging bunker fuel into San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The indictments marked the first time in five years that the U.S. attorney's office for Northern California had sought criminal charges in an environmental case. Determined to clear their names of the dumping charges, Georgantas and Karaganis returned to the Bay Area from Greece to face charges that they deliberately dumped the fuel oil after their tanker, Command, left San Francisco in September. At a morning news conference, defense attorney Douglas Schwartz said, "The voluntary return of these two men is confirmation of their innocence. What they've done takes guts. "The captain and crew had no reason to discharge perfectly good oil," said Schwartz, who represents Georgantas. "That would be like throwing money overboard." Under Greek extradition law, Schwartz said the men could have easily remained in their homeland with their families and never returned to the United States. Georgantas and Karaganis are scheduled to be arraigned before federal Magistrate Maria Elena James at 2 p.m. today. Schwartz said yesterday that he will ask that the men be allowed to post bail, so they can return to Greece until they are needed for pretrial hearings. If convicted, the men face up to 13 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. The case began in late September when the vessel was found leaking oil into San Francisco Bay during refueling. Authorities with the U.S. Coast Guard said the tanker underwent repairs to fix the leak but, after leaving the bay, intentionally dumped more oil off the coast of San Mateo County. By the time the $1.25 million cleanup ended, about 1,300 gallons of oil had been skimmed off the ocean and more than four tons of tar balls gathered from San Mateo County beaches. More than 100 birds and other wildlife were killed from being slathered in the gooey substance. Coast Guard investigators tracked the 717-foot ship and boarded it off the coast of Central America. They allegedly matched the chemical fingerprinting to oil collected from the first fuel leak with the slick that reached the San Mateo coast. The U.S. attorney's office for Northern California has been criticized in the past for not aggressively enforcing environmental laws. A study released by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility in Washington, D.C., gave the San Francisco office a poor grade for prosecuting environmental cases. Out of 94 U.S. attorney's offices nationwide, Northern California's was ranked 80th for effort, conviction rate and convictions per capita. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Jacobs said the new administration of Northern California U.S. Attorney Robert Mueller III has made environmental prosecutions a priority. Dr. Martin Topper, a staff member with the federal Environmental Protection Agency's criminal enforcement, forensics and training department, said attorneys offices across the nation have been gradually turning toward more aggressive prosecutions of environmental crime. Since the passing of the Pollution Prosecution Act in 1990, there has been an increase in the number of environmental cases and a steady rise in the number of fines that have been levied, he said. "As the population has grown, we've become more concerned about environmental issues," Topper said. "The public wants the U.S., local and state governments to make sure they are enforced. People are beginning to understand the costs and want polluters to understand there is a risk in committing this type of crime."

Greg Bluestein and Brian Skoloff, Associated PressCaptionClose The BP oil slick drifted close to the Florida Panhandle's white sand beaches for the first time Wednesday.In Florida, officials confirmed an oil sheen Tuesday about 9 miles from Pensacola beach, where the summer tourism season was just getting started.Winds were forecast to blow from the south and west, pushing the slick closer to western Panhandle beaches.Emergency crews began scouring the beaches for oil and shoring up miles of boom. County officials will use it to block oil from reaching inland waterways but plan to leave beaches unprotected because they are too difficult to protect and easier to clean up."It's inevitable that we will see it on the beaches," said Keith Wilkins, deputy chief of neighborhood and community services for Escambia County.The oil has been spreading in the gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded six weeks ago, killing 11 workers and eventually sinking. Crude has already been reported along barrier islands in Alabama and Mississippi, and it has polluted about 125 miles of Louisiana coastline.More federal fishing waters were closed, too, another setback for one of the region's most important industries. More than one-third of federal waters were off-limits for fishing, along with hundreds of square miles of state waters.Fisherman Hong Le, who came to the U.S. from Vietnam, had rebuilt his home and business after Hurricane Katrina wiped him out in 2005. Now he's facing a similar situation."I'm going to be bankrupt very soon," Le, 53, said as he attended a meeting for fishermen hoping for help. "Everything is financed, how can I pay? No fishing, no welding. I weld on commercial fishing boats and they aren't going out now, so nothing breaks."Le, like other of the fishermen, received $5,000 from BP PLC, but it was quickly gone."I call that 'Shut your mouth money,' " said Murray Volk, 46, of Empire, who's been fishing for nearly 30 years. "That won't pay the insurance on my boat and house. They say there'll be more later, but do you think the electric company will wait for that?"

Elisabeth Rosenthal, New York Times2007-06-12 04:00:00 PDT Milan -- This part of northern Italy is renowned for fashion, food, Fiat. But now it has another, less welcome claim to fame: The cities here have the worst air pollution in Europe.By mid-May, Milan had already exceeded European Union and World Health Organization limits for particle pollution in the air on 80 days. Last year was bad, too. By the end of March, Milan had had 64 such days, Turin 77, Bologna 51 and Venice 49.Particulate pollution is tied to heart disease and respiratory ailments like asthma, and poor lung development in children.While Europe's other big polluters -- Germany and Poland -- have reduced emissions since 1990, Italy's emissions have increased. This year, the European Commission deemed Italy's plan for emission reduction to be inadequate, and the country faces billions of euros in fines unless it corrects the problem.And so, when a coalition of parents and scientists fitted teenagers with portable monitors that measure ultrafine particles in November, it was no big surprise that the results were often harrowing.Tommaso Abbate, 16, found that the pollution levels at night in his living room were "really high" -- 200 micrograms per cubic meter at one point. His home is along a busy thoroughfare, he said, and "we always open the windows."During his 24 hours wearing the monitor, his average exposure was 127 micrograms per cubic meter. The World Health Organization says a safe target for such particles is 10 micrograms per cubic meter."We're not warriors, we don't want to fight, we want to cooperate," said Anna Gerometta, president of Genitori Antismog (Parents Against Pollution), who organized the monitoring program. "But we want people to rebel and politicians to pay attention. This is really bad for health."All across Europe, cities are facing air pollution levels that medical research has shown harm health, and that routinely breach World Health Organization guidelines for particulate pollution."Many countries are distant, in some cases very distant, from that level," said Roberto Bertollini, director of the health organization's European Center for Environment and Health. "We have a lot of countries where the value is at least double our guidelines."The vast majority of particulate pollution is caused by traffic jams, which are a growing problem in most European cities.Politicians face competing pressures. On the one hand, doctors and citizens groups are advocating binding standards; on the other, industries and businesses argue for greater leeway to foster economic development.In recognition of those pressures and of the high cost of cleaning the air, two years ago, the European Union proposed a target for small particles, called PM 2.5, of 25 micrograms per cubic meter. This is well above the 10 that the World Health Organization recommends, or the level of 15 that is the standard in the United States.Many doctors groups are bitter about the decision."In Europe, we feel the limits are now set too high, and countries can ignore them -- which is really, really dangerous," said Dr. Isabella Annesi-Maesano, a researcher at Inserm, an institute for health and medical research in Paris, and an official at the European Pulmonary Society, whose research shows that even a tiny increase in the smallest particles causes asthma.Both Annesi-Maesano and Bertollini said that in Europe, where carmakers were a powerful economic engine, the auto industry had lobbied hard against stricter limits."In a country with Renault and Citroen, I've learned that you can't say cars are a problem," Annesi-Maesano said.Politicians in Milan say they are making slow progress."We've had some victories," said Roberto Formigoni, president of the Lombardy region, which encompasses Milan, noting that ozone and benzene levels have sharply dropped in the past decade. But he conceded that reducing small particles has been difficult."We've reduced them 10 percent in 10 years, but they're still well above EU standards," he said.

Timothy Egan, New York TimesEight years ago, Ignacio Rodriguez took his grandson for an afternoon of fishing near his house on the Alamosa River in the foothills of the San Juan Mountains in southwest Colorado. The river that runs through the valley was his longtime neighbor, but on this day, he said, it was a stranger."The rocks were red, and the river had some greenish tinge to it," Rodriguez said in a telephone interview last week. "The fish were all belly up.Rainbow trout and German browns -- all dead. It was sickening."Rodriguez was one of many witnesses to what state officials have called the worst environmental disaster in Colorado, a spill of cyanide and acidic water from a gold-mining operation that killed almost every living thing in a 17- mile stretch of the Alamosa, though causing no known human injuries.The company responsible for the spill, Summitville Consolidated Mining Corp. , declared bankruptcy, and its major officers fled the country, leaving taxpayers with a cleanup bill that is approaching $150 million.It may take decades before clean water runs year-round through the Alamosa. But the account of what happened in the little valley in a remote corner of Colorado nearly a decade ago is emerging, both sides say, as a central exhibit in the testing of the political philosophy of Gale Norton, President-elect Bush's choice for secretary of the interior.Norton, 46, was Colorado's attorney general when the Alamosa was poisoned with waste from the Summitville mine, and it was under her administration that many of the legal proceedings against the mine's owners were initiated. Even Norton's political opponents in Colorado say her office did a commendable job in trying to get compensation for the damage, though they criticize her for not pressing criminal charges.But it is not Norton's conduct as the state's chief legal officer that is being debated in connection with the Summitville mine. Rather, it is her philosophy. Norton, like Bush, has long advocated allowing the mining, timber and oil industries more leeway to police themselves. Their argument is that if businesses are given incentives, like immunity from fines and prosecution, for reporting and cleaning up their own pollution, most will do the right thing -- a so-called self-audit.Norton also has been a consistent advocate of states' rights and minimal federal interference. But in the Summitville case, it was the federal government that stepped in, acting on an emergency basis after the poisoning of the river to avert an even larger disaster, and later winning felony convictions against many of the corporate owners of the mine. The state welcomed the federal intervention."The whole problem with Summitville goes back to the essential trust that the state put in that mining company," said Larry MacDonnell, former director of the Natural Resources Law Center at the University of Colorado. "Summitville is a poster child for the inadequacy of that kind of philosophy."Regulation was so lax and state laws so weak -- both were strengthened after the mine disaster -- that Summitville is seen by members of both parties in Colorado as a lesson for the vigilance that government needs to keep over potential polluters.Pending her confirmation hearing, Norton would not comment on Summitville.But five years ago, when she was asked about how her philosophy of giving polluters incentives to come forth squared with the Summitville case, she said,"This was an unusual case, a situation where the individual in question knew about continued environmental problems and continued with operations in spite of that."In her writings and speeches, Norton has preached a new kind of environmentalism, less dependent on federal policing. "We need to give good businesses the incentive and the tools to be good environmental citizens," she said.The pollution of the Alamosa River affected Norton deeply, according to people who worked with her when she was attorney general from 1990 to 1998."Summitville, to her, was a disaster of huge magnitude," said Tim Tymkovich,who served as solicitor general for Norton.Norton's supporters expect her to bring big changes to managing more than 500 million acres of public land, from national parks to wildlife refuges, and to regulating the thousands of mines operating on federal property. As a protegee of James Watt, who angered environmental groups as Ronald Reagan's interior secretary, and as a onetime delegate to the Libertarian Party presidential convention, Norton has advocated free-market approaches to solving environmental problems.But even Norton's staunchest allies say the Summitville disaster points to the limitations of the free-market, hands-off approach."Self-auditing without the potential to bring down the hammer will not work, " said Terry Anderson, who is a member of the Bush transition team on the interior and is director of the Political Economy Research Center, a free- market environmental research group in Bozeman, Mont. Anderson suggested Norton to Bush for the interior post."What Gale Norton will bring is reform, but not revolution," Anderson said. "To think that she will come in and let the polluters off the hook if they only agree to 'fess up is dead wrong."But people who live in the valley that lost all aquatic life to a mine that was, according to court documents, poorly regulated, say they fear that Norton will bring a philosophy to the office that only invites more Summitvilles.

Juliette Terzieff, Chronicle Foreign ServiceCaptionClose2003-08-12 04:00:00 PDT Rawalpindi, Pakistan -- Mohammad Saleem gingerly picked his way through garbage piles and animal droppings down the sloping bank of the Lai River, eyeing his stable of seven water buffalo cooling themselves in the oily brown water. "Everyone knows the water's dirty," he mused, glancing downstream at a group of 10 young boys splashing around underneath Rawalpindi's Pir Wadhai bridge. Saleem knows his animals not only contribute to the mess but may also contract -- and pass along through their milk -- waterborne diseases. An estimated 150,000 cows and water buffalo routinely bathe in the Lai -- the same animals that provide the milk supply to Rawalpindi and the capital, Islamabad. "Too much heat will make them ill anyway," he said of the buffalo, "and how can you deny living creatures a chance to enjoy themselves?" Degraded by decades of industrial and human waste, much of the Lai, once a fish-filled freshwater stream, is now a sludge canal threatening the health of more than 2 million people who live along its banks. Pakistani citizens are paying a high price for the pollution of their water supply. "About 40,000 children a year die from drinking contaminated or polluted water, and 60 percent of infant deaths are caused by waterborne diseases," according to the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC). Every fifth person in the country suffers from illness associated with pollution, and 40 percent of deaths in urban centers are caused by unsafe water. A huge amount of sewage is pumped into the Lai every day. Of 65 million gallons of liquid waste produced daily in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, only 5 million gallons are treated. All the sewage eventually is dumped into the Lai. On top of that, hundreds of tons of solid waste from the two cities are added every day. Hospitals, medical schools, textile and marble factories all make their special contribution to the polluted water. "Pakistan generates over 50,000 tons of solid waste per day - out of which only 20 to 25 percent is collected but not disposed of in the proper manner. Only 3 percent of the industry treats their wastes, while the rest discharges untreated effluent into rivers, lakes and the sea," states the U.N. Environmental Program (UNEP) country report for Pakistan. The resulting contamination has degraded aquatic life to the point where many species, including freshwater turtles, frogs and some fish such as trout are endangered. It also poses serious health risks to humans in the area, UNEP says. According to the UNEP report, about 47 percent of the population has no access to safe drinking water, and nearly 84 percent of the rural population is without sanitation facilities. Waterborne diseases account for 20 to 30 percent of infant deaths in the country, and pollution contributes to the incidence of cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, diarrhea, dysentery, yellow fever and malaria. Originating in the federally protected Margalla Hills National Park in nearby Islamabad, the Lai is about 26 miles long. From Rawalpindi, it empties into the Soan River and eventually into the Indus, which flows through the cradle of ancient South Asian civilization, home to millions of people. "There are 11 government institutions tasked with coordinating on the environment . . . (but) no single entity bears full responsibility," said Ali Tauqeer Sheikh, director of Leadership for Environment and Development (LEAD). "You end up with a cycle where every year environmental concerns become a hot issue for a short time, but everything remains the same." Over the years, various institutions have launched projects to combat the pollution. In 1996, the Rawalpindi Development Authority, the city's municipal developer, floated a plan to build canals to feed sewage into a treatment plant to be built near the River Soan. The provincial government signed off on the project, but the Punjab Planning Commission held up the $17 million plan until the government changed -- effectively killing the project. "For several decades, short-term issues have dominated planning. When the government is worried about surviving the week, they're not worried about environmental consequences five years from now," said Sheikh. "The environment just isn't a priority." Illegal felling of trees and digging by slum dwellers and housing developers have all encroached upon the banks of the Lai, increasing the risks of casualties during the annual summer monsoon season. In July 2001, 35 people died when their homes were swept away by floodwaters. Sheikh said 54 freshwater streams in 54 Pakistani cities are all being degraded in a similar fashion. The government of President Pervez Musharraf has promised to examine the issue, instituting a series of research projects to study ways to combat air and water pollution, but people like Saleem who live on the banks of polluted waterways do not expect positive change any time soon.

By Chip JohnsonCaptionCloseIn the environmentally conscious Bay Area, concerns about poor air quality - or a toxic emergency - are usually associated with the oil refineries just up the East Bay shoreline in the industrial cities of Richmond, Rodeo and Martinez. So it came as a shock last week when USA Today published a report that included three Berkeley schools in the top 1 percent among the nation's most at-risk sites for exposure to toxic air emissions. The national newspaper identified Black Pine Circle School, Via Center and Nihaus School among the worst 400 sites in an eight-month study that looked at more than 127,000 schools nationwide. Oddly enough, the Rosa Parks Elementary School, which sits next door to Black Pine, was listed in the nation's 6th percentile group. While some dispute the newspaper's findings, the report has caused a stir. Just about everybody knows there are special rules of conduct in every city - institutions, legends and things held close to the heart. Bay Area burgs are no different. If you have a problem with gays, San Francisco is probably not the place to voice your displeasure. In Oakland, criticizing the mayor is fine, but don't bad-mouth the Raiders, never mind the disappointment and despair of another lost season. And in the Nuclear Free City, if you talk about the city's environmental practices, you must be looking for a fight. In addition to rankling a few official sources, the newspaper report rekindled a grudge more than 25 years old between the nation's No. 4 steel manufacturer and the nation's No. 1 environmentally conscious community. Citizens in Berkeley have used this opportunity to talk about their "dirty little secret" and to single out Pacific Steel Castings, Inc., as the community's chief polluter. The company, which sits on Second Street, is a homegrown business that has operated in West Berkeley for more than 70 years.Elisabeth Jewel, spokeswoman for Pacific Steel Castings, said the company took issue with the newspaper's findings and pointed out that with West Berkeley's proximity to one of nation's busiest freeways and other industrial plants in the area, it is irresponsible to blame one source. The EPA report used as the basis for the article is not data used to report emissions at any level of government, said Lisa Fasano, a spokeswoman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. "It erroneously reported emissions data that are actually not quantified or verified by the EPA," Fasano said. The district's air quality monitoring has identified parts of east and west Oakland, areas near the Port of Oakland and refinery operations in Richmond as areas most at-risk. Jewel dismissed outright any findings reached through community testing efforts as amateurish. "It's frustrating from our perspective because there is no basis in science whatsoever," she said. But soon there will be more solid emissions data. Seven months ago the Bay Area Air Quality Management District installed monitoring equipment two blocks from the plant. "They asked for it and they got it - not community members with test kits," Jewel said. In Berkeley, environmental issues are the meat and potatoes of political life and no one knows that better than the city's mayor, Tom Bates. Bates is a sitting director on the board of the air quality district and led the charge to sue to save a grove of trees threatened by expansion on the UC Berkeley campus. But there are residents and community groups in Berkeley and the East Bay who believe the newspaper report, which focused on areas in or near school sites, has merit and should be investigated further. With a grant provided by the air quality district, Denny Larson, the executive director of Global Community Monitor, conducted tests near the plant last summer. He found that Berkeley has failed to hold the steel manufacturer to the community standard. "It's the greenest city on earth, with a dirty little toxic secret," he said of the city's relationship with the plant. "Most people think they are being protected by the EPA, and when they send their kids to school they aren't worrying about air quality, and certainly not in places like Berkeley. It's both scary and laughable because the city has not applied its green energy principles when it comes to Pacific Steel Castings." The newspaper article has already spurred some residents to act, and immediately strengthened the Healthy Air Coalition - a community group rekindled from the bones of several groups gathered to address plant operations over the years. Neighborhood resident Robin Harley, who has one child and is pregnant, said the smell from the plant has always been a concern but she contacted the group because of worries about heavy metals being released. Carrie Wilson, who lives four blocks from the plant, said she lives in the toxic footprint identified in the tests conducted by Larson's group last summer. Her 3-year-old daughter suffers from asthma and she said doctors believe it's been triggered by particulate matter in the air. "I never thought I would leave Berkeley to go back to Bush's state for cleaner air," said the Texas native. "But I'm thinking about it."

Erling Hoh, Chronicle Foreign ServiceCaptionClose2002-03-04 04:00:00 PDT Yinchuan, China -- The Yellow River, once the cradle of Chinese civilization and the inspiration of poetry, is on the verge of becoming a vast ditch, experts say. All along the Yellow's 3,400-mile course through nine provinces, its tributaries lie dry. In many places, it has been reduced to a sluggish stream. The drying up of China's second-longest river is changing life all along its course. In 1972, the river ran dry before reaching the Yellow Sea for the first time in history. In 1997, the river's lower reaches lay dry for 227 days. Moreover, the discharge of toxins from cities and factories has made river water unfit for irrigation and human consumption along much of its route. "Only 15 percent of Yellow River water is treated, and only 20 percent is recycled," said Vaclav Smil, a professor of geography at the University of Manitoba in Canada and an expert on China's water problems. A good example of the river's plight is Ningxia province. Since the 1949 communist revolution, agricultural land irrigated by the river in the province has expanded from 309,000 acres to 1.1 million. Part of this land is used to grow rice, a crop that requires twice as much water as corn or sorghum. In Yinchuan, the capital of Ningxia province in Inner Mongolia, a Yellow River museum opened last year in an attempt to educate people about the history of the river and the importance of water conservation. This arid province, with 6 million inhabitants, would be a desert without the river. "It has only rained twice in the whole year," said a resident standing by the river in Shizuishan, a coal-mining town in northern Ningxia. He pointed to some simple houses on the opposite side. "Those are new. The people moved there because their villages up in the hills ran out of water." All along the Yellow River, diversion and dam projects, big and small, are in progress. There are plans for more than 10 new dams on the river. Originating in the Himalayas, the Yellow River traverses the high plateau of Qinchai province and the deserts of Inner Mongolia before emerging in the fertile plains of northern China. The desiccated inner provinces divert as much water as they can, leaving little for densely populated areas along the river's lower reaches. Especially down river in Shandong, the last province before the river meets the Yellow Sea, the shortage of water has led to several riots in the past few years. Diversion projects and dams have been Beijing's main response. As a result, critics argue that too little has been done to tackle the roots of the crisis - - deforestation of the inner provinces; indiscriminate, uneconomical use of water for agriculture; outdated factories that use more water than necessary; erosion, overpopulation, the lack of a functioning price system, and the lack of water treatment plants. Since the end of the civil war in 1949, China's population has increased by 700 million and a program of rapid industrialization has placed an unprecedented strain on the nation's environment. The most obvious sign is the water crisis. According to the United Nations, 80 percent of China's major rivers are so polluted that they no longer support fish. Across northern China, the groundwater table is sinking by about 5 feet per year because of overpumping. As water tables fall, satellite photographs show hundreds of lakes and rivers disappearing. In Shanxi province, the Fen River, a Yellow River tributary that used to run through the capital, Taiyuan, barely exists. Aquifers beneath the city have dropped more than 300 feet, and planners wonder whether the 2 million residents will eventually have to move. Because the Yellow River was once the source of ancient Chinese civilization, it has often been called the "mother river." Around 4000 B.C., people made the switch from hunting and gathering to agriculture in the Yellow River Valley. Since then, the nation's rulers have been judged by their ability to manage the unevenly distributed, highly seasonal water resources. Today, there are about 48 million acres of arable land and 100 million people residing within the river basin. The river is so overused that it failed to complete its course to the Yellow River in 1972 for the first time in recorded history. But the Yellow River is not the only major Chinese river threatened by development. In 2000, Beijing announced its intention to go ahead with a gigantic project to divert water from the Yangtze in three separate channels to the arid north, an idea ascribed to the late Mao Zedong. "The north of China needs water, and the south has plenty," Mao said in 1952. "If possible, the north may borrow some water from the south." According to preliminary estimates, 26 billion cubic yards of water from the Yangtze will be diverted annually to the north. Although this constitutes only a fraction of the river's annual flow, some scholars are already warning that the Yangtze will eventually run dry too. Paradoxically, even as the Yellow River dries up, the threat of flooding remains. Because a high level of fine, yellowish silt accumulates on its long journey down the river, the body of water is the world's muddiest major river. When it reaches the flat North China Plain, silt settles on the river bed, raising it by 4 to 6 inches per year. In some places, the Yellow River now flows within banks that rise 60 feet above the surrounding plain. Under the torrential rains of summer, the river swells rapidly, and any rupture of the embankments can cause havoc -- hence the river's nickname: China's Sorrow. Just north of the last bridge across the Yellow River before it enters the sea, near the town of Kenli, Wang Guishan runs a little kiosk atop the northern dike. "The river usually runs dry in March," he said. "This year, though, they (government officials) have kept the river flowing all year" by lowering the water level in reservoirs. An acquaintance from a nearby village arrived on a bicycle with two plastic containers. There was no water in his village, he explained. Wang has a tap. The man filled his two containers with brownish water and rode off. At the foot of the dike, the flood plain stretched for about half a mile to the river. Until only a few years ago, the farmers in Wang's village cultivated this fertile land. But recently, because of soil salinization, the farmers have abandoned these fields, cutting their land under cultivation by half. In Inner Mongolia, in a village near the steel town of Baotou that lies between the Yellow River and the Gobi Desert, Tian Shenhai, 64, lives with her husband, son and daughter-in-law. In the past, family members reared 300 sheep. Now, they can feed 60 to 70. A law introduced last year to curtail the desertification of Inner Mongolia is in effect, barring the family from letting their sheep graze freely. The animals are now fenced in, and grass is brought to them. Tian worries about where she will get the $150 she needs to comply with the new obligation of buying a machine that processes grass. Outside Tian's house of sun-dried mud and straw, a sand dune washes up against one of its walls. "Twenty years ago," Tian recalled, "the grass grew so high you couldn't see people."

Sophie MaxwellIt may be easy for those who stand to profit from inaction, and those who aren't impacted directly by pollution, to call for yet another study of the combustion turbine project that will shut down the polluting Potrero Hill power plant in San Francisco. But for those of us who live in the shadow of the smokestacks, the time to act is now.Today, a committee of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors has the historic opportunity to reduce air pollution in San Francisco and bring environmental justice to neighborhoods that have too long suffered from the impacts of the polluting Potrero power plant.For more than seven years, I have worked with Bayview-Hunters Point, Potrero Hill and Dogpatch neighbors and leaders to close the Mirant-owned plant, one of the most polluting left in the Bay Area. And for more than seven years, we have exhaustively explored alternatives to the ONLY project that state regulators have repeatedly said will pave the way for plant closure - the construction and operation of new, natural gas-fired combustion turbines. But when people's lives and health are at stake every day, at some point we must stop exploring and start acting.PG&E is openly funding a cynical campaign against the peaker project. They have fought tooth and nail against efforts by the city to develop our own renewable power sources or assert our energy independence. They oppose the peaker project only because it threatens their monopolistic stranglehold on our city. This time, their lies and misinformation threaten to do very real damage to the people of the southeastern San Francisco community.The three proposed in-city combustion turbines are far cleaner and smaller than the existing four Potrero plant units. According to emissions data from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the entire Potrero plant emits three times the ozone and fine particulate matter that will come from the new combustion turbines. The existing Potrero plant is also harmful for San Francisco Bay. Every day, the current plant discharges 226 million gallons of superheated water into the bay, damaging the local ecosystem and stirring up hazardous sediments settled on the bay floor. The new peaker units, however, will use recycled cooling water that results in zero discharge into San Francisco Bay.PG&E claims that we should allow the Potrero plant to continue operating and make the neighborhoods wait while the city studies still more ideas to someday close the plant. But the city has pursued and investigated other options for years, including more energy conservation, more renewable and solar energy, advanced transmission upgrades and more, in the hopes that state energy regulators would accept these projects as a replacement for the peaker units.Each and every time, the California Independent System Operator - the agency that monitors and oversees California's energy grid - has been firm in the need for the in-city power generation and "round-the-clock" availability that only the peaker units provide. By any measure, completing the peaker units and closing the Potrero plant units will decrease visual blight and bring enormous improvements in air and water quality - and public health - to the surrounding neighborhoods. And let me be clear: I look forward to the day when we can shut down the peaker units as well. But until then, we have an obligation to shutter that rusty plant from 1975 that spews toxins into my neighborhood every single day.Opponents of the project talk about the need for more options without presenting a single alternative that also guarantees closure. As a mother and a grandmother who has raised children in the Bayview, I cannot accept any more theoretical debate when people's lives are at stake.Rejecting the peaker project will only guarantee the continued operation of the polluting Potrero power plant every single day for years to come. Let us see through PG&E's smear campaign. Let us bring environmental justice to the southeastern sector. Let us not squander our best chance to shut down the Bay Area's most polluting power plant, right here in San Francisco.

Erin Hallissy, Chronicle East Bay BureauEnvironmentalists protested yesterday that a wastewater pond at Unocal's Rodeo refinery could endanger wildlife because it contains high amounts of selenium. About 20 protesters, one dressed as the grim reaper, suggested that the pollution has the potential to create an ecological disaster such as the one that occurred at Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in Merced County, where wildlife was deformed and poisoned by high levels of selenium during the 1980s. Members of Communities for a Better Environment have long attacked Unocal for discharging selenium into San Francisco Bay, but they focused their offensive yesterday by contending that the pond is also hazardous to migratory waterfowl. The San Francisco-based group unfurled a banner proclaiming the pond a "Selenium Wildlife Refuge" and charged that Unocal is the worst polluter of the five refineries that operate along the north shore of Contra Costa County and in Benicia. "Unocal is the biggest selenium polluter of the bay," said Greg Karras, a scientist for Communities for a Better Environment. "We have been asking Unocal to address this problem for six years. It's putting profit over protection." Unocal spokesman Kevin Elliott, who called the protest a "stunt" to gain attention, said that the pond does not pose a threat to wildlife and that the refinery is complying with its state water board permit for discharging selenium into the bay. Selenium is a naturally occurring element vital to life in trace amounts but toxic in high concentrations. Crude oil from the San Joaquin Valley contains large amounts of selenium. The state and federal governments ordered refineries to reduce selenium discharges by 1993, but the state Regional Water Quality Control Board granted four- year extensions to Unocal, Shell and Exxon because they said they needed more time to devise the technology to do so. Chevron, Tosco and the now- closed Pacific Refining have met the stricter standards since 1993. Communities for a Better Environment sued to overturn the extensions and won at the trial level, but Unocal has appealed the ruling and meanwhile the extensions remain in effect, water board officials say. Elliott said Unocal is allowed under its permit to release 5.6 pounds of selenium a day, and it has been releasing 4.73 pounds a day. By July 1998, the amount must be reduced to .85 pounds a day. "The industry is working together on this," Elliott said. "We are probably going to beat our deadline by as much as six months. There is nothing slow about this." Elliott said it is not fair for environmentalists to suggest that the wastewater pond is similar to a reservoir at Kesterson, which was contaminated by selenium tainted by agricultural runoff. At Kesterson, the water collected, and selenium levels remained at high concentrations for long periods of time. At Unocal, the wastewater moves through the pond and then out into the bay, so selenium levels do not build up, Elliott said. "You just can't compare the two," Elliott said. "Their continuing misinformation has tried to sort of confuse the issue."

Edward Cody, Washington Post2005-12-22 04:00:00 PDT Beijing -- A zinc smelter discharged toxic waste into the Bei River in southern China last weekend, forcing one city to order a daylong suspension of water supplies and threatening other cities as the pollution moves downstream, residents and official media reported Wednesday. Authorities said the discharge in Guangdong, China's most densely populated province, contained high levels of cadmium. It marked China's second environmental crisis in a month. An explosion at a chemical plant in northeastern Jilin province in November sent 100 tons of toxic benzene floating down the Songhua River and caused a water cutoff of several days in the nearby city of Harbin. The disasters underlined growing pressures on the environment and industrial safety in China as the economy booms and the Beijing government has trouble getting growth-minded local officials to enforce environment and safety regulations. A resident contacted by telephone said water had been cut off all day Tuesday in Shaoguan, in the far northern section of Guangdong province about 170 miles north of Hong Kong. The taps began running again around 5 p.m., she added. Shaoguan has about 520,000 people in its urban center. Officials who answered the phone at the Shaoguan city government and water company and refused to give their names denied there was any disruption of water supplies. The official Guangdong television station warned residents farther downstream not to drink tap water along some sections of the river, which runs about 300 miles southward through heavily industrialized Guangdong province until it spills into the Pearl River. In Yingde, a city of 1 million residents 60 miles south of Shaoguan, officials started building a mile-long water pipe to connect the threatened downtown area with a suburban reservoir isolated from the river-borne pollution, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Downstream from Shaoguan, the major city of Guangzhou -- China's southern business center -- was ordered to make emergency plans to ensure safe water supplies, Xinhua reported Wednesday. The Bei flows into the Pearl River, which passes Guangzhou and empties into the South China Sea west of Hong Kong. Xinhua didn't say what Guangzhou had been told to do, or how many people there rely on river water. The report said Foshan, a nearby manufacturing center, also had been told to make precautions even though the chemicals weren't expected to threaten either city. It also said 20 monitoring stations had been set up along the Bei. An unnamed government official told the agency that the pipeline should be completed before the polluted waters reach the city distribution system, estimated for sometime today. In addition, he said, fire engines and other tanker trunks have been mobilized to carry water to the threatened downtown area and upstream reservoirs have released water into the river to dilute the pollution. Environmental protection officials blamed the crisis on waste discharged by a smelter in Shaoguan. The waste, they said, contained up to 10 times the safe level of cadmium, a metal that can damage internal organs and lead to cancer. The official television broadcast Tuesday night said authorities on Sunday had ordered the plant to halt its discharge. But there was no explanation why the waste being disposed of contained an unusual amount of cadmium.

Jane Kay, Chronicle Environment WriterCaptionClose The most comprehensive survey ever of pollutants in California's lakes and reservoirs has found that only a few of the most popular fishing spots are free of mercury, PCBs and other contaminants.Of 152 lakes tested statewide, 21 were clean while 131 showed one or more pollutants at levels above state health guidelines, according to the study released Monday by the State Water Resources Control Board.In Northern California, some of the cleanest were the high-elevation lakes of the Sierra Nevada and the Trinity Alps. The only Bay Area body of water free of contaminants found was Lago Los Osos in Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area in Fremont, where fishing isn't allowed."This study is helping to define the scope of the statewide problem of contaminants accumulating in sport fish," said Jay Davis, lead author and toxicologist at the nonprofit San Francisco Estuary Institute in Oakland.Results of the two-year study of California lakes, rivers, reservoirs and coastal waters will be used to develop cleanup plans in watersheds that feed the lakes and to establish guidelines for consuming fish to protect anglers and their families from health risks, Davis said.In addition to the 100 popular lakes tested in 2007, the survey included 50 other lakes picked at random. Next year, 2008 sampling results from 100 additional lakes will be released, bringing the total to 250 lakes out of 9,000 in California. Some 12,000 fish are being collected and tested, including bass, trout, catfish and carp.Popular lakes were those that appeared in fishing guides and were known to state fish and water officials. The lakes were considered clean if all concentrations of pollutants in all the tested species were below thresholds set by the state.Toxic chemicals under scrutiny were mercury, most of which comes from past mining activities; PCBs, chemicals once used in electrical equipment; and the banned pesticides DDT, dieldrin and chlordane. Fish were also tested for selenium, which is discharged as waste from oil refineries and seeps from irrigated land in the Central Valley.Methylmercury, the potent form of mercury that taints fish, is the most widespread potential health risk, the study said.Inorganic mercury, used as an ingredient in gold mining or washing out of crushed rock and natural rock formations, transforms to methylmercury in rivers and lakes, where it accumulates in ever-higher concentrations as it moves up the food chain to larger fish-eating species, such as large-mouth bass.About one-fourth of the lakes surveyed had at least one fish species with a mercury level high enough that state health officials would consider prohibiting it for the most sensitive humans - pregnant and nursing women, women between 18 and 45 years old who might conceive and children. PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are the chemicals that caused the second-most concern among health officials. In Northern California, more than one-third of the lakes had a fish species with a concentration about the state's threshold.Concentrations of banned pesticides and selenium were generally low, and they infrequently exceeded the state's thresholds, the study said.The study will be used to identify the lakes where state health officials should return to gather and test more fish and establish safe-eating guidelines, officials said. The strictest limits will be set for pregnant and nursing women because they can pass pollutants onto fetuses and infants, who are most vulnerable to poisons. Mercury and PCBs can impair mental and motor development, while PCBs and the pesticides are believed to increase cancer risks.Curtis Knight, Mount Shasta manager for California Trout, a 7,500-member conservation organization, said the new information is important for knowing which fish are safe to eat."A big part of fishing in a lake is fishing with your kids. That's how they learn to fish. You certainly want to know what you're feeding your kids, and you want that to be safe," Knight said.Knight said the lakes and the fish in them are indicators of watershed health. "Lakes are collecting bodies for what's coming out of the streams, and that gives a sense of the watershed's history," he said.Read the report at links.sfgate.com/ZGZG.Read the state's guidelines at links.sfgate.com/ZGZH.

Mike Clendenin2000-09-05 04:00:00 PDT Taipei -- After two decades of building one of Asia's richest economies, Taiwan is casting a wary eye on its legacy of rapid development. The former Nationalist Party government ushered in the "economic miracle" that has turned the island into one of the world's top suppliers of high technology. The economy is diversified; foreign currency reserves are high and debt is low -- all factors that helped Taiwan emerge from the 1997 Asian economic crisis relatively unscathed. But this nation of 22 million has been less fortunate in eluding the fallout from breakneck development. Once regarded as the Ilha Formosa, or "Beautiful Island," it is now plagued by polluted rivers. And as more pollution bubbles to the surface, the new government of President Chen Shui Bian is being watched closely by both environmental groups and an increasingly vocal middle class who are pressuring for more regulatory enforcement. "It makes me feel embarrassed sometimes to be Taiwanese, because you like to see the country get better and better," said Fang Ching Chi, executive secretary of the Environmental Education Center, based in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Chen's Democratic Progressive Party has long had close ties with "green" groups. But after being an opposition politician for more than a decade, he now faces the challenge of living up to his reputation for being environmentally sensitive while sustaining Taiwan's economic prosperity. Taiwan's burgeoning green movement wants the island to discard its tiger economy credo of pursuing development at the price of environmental preservation. The movement's strength can be seen in its dogged fight to prevent the completion of the controversial $5.6 billion Fourth Nuclear Power Plant. Since taking office in May, Chen has wavered on a campaign promise to kill the project -- a pledge that gained him crucial votes in his narrow victory over the Nationalists. The power plant, situated 24 miles from Taipei, is only 30 percent completed. Chen says he will decide the matter later this month. The paramount issue for environmentalists is their contention that Taiwan has far exceeded its limit for sustainable development. Today, the nation is capable of processing only 40 percent of its industrial waste, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That grim reality has spurred the government to ask North Korea, Russia and Cambodia to dispose of Taiwan's industrial and nuclear waste for a hefty fee. In a high profile case last year, Cambodia returned 2,700 tons of mercury-laced waste produced by Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Corporation after several deaths occurred near the disposal site. A World Health Organization investigation later showed that the waste had far exceeded permissible levels of mercury. "What can we do now?" asked Huang Hsiao Hsin, a member of the government's Industrial Development Bureau. "We are urging industry to reduce waste as much as they can." Taiwan corporations routinely hire government-sanctioned "waste handlers" to find a safe place to store its industrial waste. But these agents are well aware that there are few storage places left and typically arrange for local workers or crime organizations to get rid of toxic matter. Recently, more than a dozen people were charged with attempted homicide for pouring 100 tons of toxic chemicals into a river that feeds Kaohsiung's major water supply. As a result, 3 million residents went without water for five days while officials waited for the toxics to filter through the system. In Taiwan's largest environmental crime, prosecutors allege that the same sanctioned waste handler who hired the men in the Kaohsiung affair dumped at least 14,000 tons of toxic solvents into river systems across the island. "For the last 20 or 30 years, there has been more serious contamination," said George Cheng, director of the Taiwan Watch Institute, an environmental think tank. "But they (Taiwan residents) take pollution for granted because we need money and economic development." Those days may be over. Last month, a lobby composed of 750 scholars from the southern town of Meinung successfully stopped the construction of a nearby dam, arguing that it would have flooded a valley that is home to one of the highest concentrations of butterflies in the world. "We used both will and knowledge to resist the proposed dam," said Wu Chi Tsung, the group's leader. "Now it is time to shift our focus to other injustices." Individuals are also speaking out. Take Wu Wen Tung, who owns an electronics store in Kungliao lined with televisions and powerful stereos. Although Wu is well aware that a new nuclear power plant could end an energy shortage and ensure electronic sales, he is vehemently against the project. "The plant is not even completed and there has already been major damage; the food chain is very complicated," he said, referring to the loss of fish by the dumping of landfill and concrete to build the plant's pier. Other critics argue that Taiwan already has three nuclear power plants and an accident is more likely with the fourth because it is located near an earthquake fault line. President Chen has assigned a high-profile team of academics and government officials to re-evaluate the necessity of the plant, which lies within a government-designated nature area visited by several million people a year. An idyllic beach lies near the plant's front gate. If Chen stops the plant, it would be a monumental about-face in Taiwan's heavy emphasis on economic development. "Nobody knows what will happen," said Wang To Far, an economics professor who is part of the reassessment team. "The meetings have been very divisive. Most (government) officials still think of economic growth first." Taipower, the state-owned electric utility, claims to have already spent $1.4 billion on the project and has signed contracts for another $1.4 billion, of which at least $819 million would have to be paid if the plant is scrapped. "Even though we have a new government, the low-level bureaucrats still have the thinking of 10 years ago," said Wang, the government adviser. "We still need some time to realize that we have to give up a little economic growth in order to improve our living situation."

Jim Doyle, Chronicle Staff WriterCaptionCloseTalk about dirty jobs.Contractors in wetsuits spent hours Wednesday digging a pit next to a ruptured steel pipeline at a sewage treatment plant near the Sausalito shoreline in hopes of stopping a leak that has spewed about 500,000 gallons of foul-smelling waste into San Francisco Bay.At low tide, they attached a custom-made collar in an attempt to stop the torrent of raw and partially treated sewage, which was gushing out of a roughly 2 1/2-inch diameter hole in the larger pipe at a rate of up to 300 gallons a minute.By the end of the day, officials said, workers had succeeded in stopping most of it from flowing into the bay. "It's a nasty, nasty job," said Ray Gergus, who sits on the board of directors of the Sausalito-Marin City Sanitary District, which operates the Fort Baker treatment plant.The bacteria-laden leak, discovered early Tuesday afternoon, is the latest in a slew of spills that have polluted bay waters and soiled the shoreline of southern Marin County. As the early afternoon tide began to rise, the contractors reached a troubling conclusion: Their temporary fix had significantly reduced the volume of leaking sewage, but didn't stop the leak. A tight seal couldn't easily be fabricated, so the workers moved on to Plan B: They rigged hoses to divert the waste back into the treatment plant. "Virtually all of the leakage has been stopped," said Bob Simmons, general manager of the sanitary district. "It's now leaking at less than a gallon per minute. What we ended up doing here is not a fully engineered repair. It's a temporary fix."After the hole is plugged, he plans to hire a contractor to encase a 6-foot section of the ruptured pipe in concrete, with steel bars for strengthening.The treatment plant serves about 18,000 customers in Tamalpais Valley, Marin City, Sausalito, the Marin Headlands and Fort Baker. The broken pipe carries treated and untreated sewage from the plant's primary and secondary treatment facilities.Simmons said the spilled sewage had been partially treated, with 60 percent of the solids removed. He blamed corrosion and a possible defect in the 24-inch diameter steel pipe. The pipe, which is coated with concrete, is about 23 years old."This type of pipe should last 50 years," Simmons said. "We think the majority of the pipe is in good shape."Southern Marin County has experienced a slew of sewage leaks in recent years.In 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered nine sanitary agencies and districts in Marin County, including the Sausalito-Marin City Sanitary District, to formulate plans to reduce sewage leaks.In January 2008, two spills from facilities operated by the Sewerage Agency of Southern Marin - which serves the Mill Valley area - dumped more than 5 million gallons of raw and partially treated sewage into the bay. The smaller Sausalito-Marin City Sanitary District has had its own problems. In January 2008, the district's collection system in northern Sausalito leaked 63,000 gallons of sewage into the bay, and a power outage that month resulted in a leak of 17,000 gallons at another one of its facilities. In August 2008, about 12,000 gallons of sewage leaked at its pump facility at the foot of Sausalito's Main Street. Simmons attributed southern Marin County's high frequency of sewage spills to rain and the county's hilly terrain, a combination that increases the volume of peak flows through the sewer system."We try to run a professional operation. We have a significant capital improvement project ahead of us," Simmons said. "We've been under construction for the last five years and we've worked very hard." Built in 1953, the treatment plant was upgraded in the late 1980s.The sanitary district is pursuing a $30 million capital improvement program, including plans for a $14 million underground storage basin to be opened in four years. The district's board of directors has approved a 30 percent rate increase to begin paying for these projects.Meanwhile, signs have been posted along the southern Marin County shoreline to alert people that the sewage spill has contaminated the water and warning them not to swim or fish.Deb Self, executive director of the Baykeeper environmental organization, said: "What we know is that it's basically untreated sewage, or mostly that. ... We have a lot of birds and herring roe that have been exposed to the Cosco Busan and other oil spills, so their immune systems are already compromised."She said that currents have probably flushed some of the pollutants including harmful bacteria out of the bay, but some of the discharge may be pushed by currents into Richardson Bay.Staff members at the Richardson Bay Audubon Center & Sanctuary said Wednesday that they have not seen any ill effects from the ongoing release of sewage.The local Regional Water Quality Control Board is investigating the incident, and the sanitary district's Simmons said he expects an enforcement action."A fine is inevitable," Simmons said. "It'll probably be hundreds of thousands of dollars. ... We created a hazard and some environmental harm."He added: "I think fines help get the bad apples moving, but I wouldn't consider us as one of them."

Reynolds Holding, Chronicle Legal Affairs WriterEnvironmental groups sued the U.S. Navy yesterday for allegedly polluting Treasure Island and San Francisco Bay with oil and diesel fuel leaked from storage tanks and pipelines. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco, cites Navy documents in charging that 28 underground storage tanks, 12 aboveground tanks and more than three miles of pipeline on Treasure Island have leaked substantial amounts of fuel. The pollutants have seeped into the ground and flowed into the bay through 59 storm drains, the suit contends. In all, the suit says, the Navy is liable for 464,000 violations of federal environmental law. If found guilty, the Navy could face millions of dollars in fines. "The Navy has turned Treasure Island into a huge, oil-soaked sponge," said Michael Lozeau, executive director of San Francisco BayKeeper, which filed the suit with Arc Ecology. Ken McNeill, a spokesman for the naval station on Treasure Island, said he could not comment directly on the lawsuit. The Navy has an "ongoing investigation and remedial cleanup of sites out here," McNeill said. "We are working on all of this in cooperation with the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) and intend to restore our installation to its pristine condition." Yesterday's suit amends a complaint filed last August contending that the Navy's sewage-treatment plant on Treasure Island has spewed toxic wastes into the bay. It is the latest effort by the two environmental groups to make the Navy clean up various bases around the Bay Area. A similar suit alleging environmental violations at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard was filed in 1994, and the groups are pushing for clean-up measures at Alameda Naval Station, Point Molate Naval Fuel Depot in Richmond and Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The situation on Treasure Island is particularly urgent because the Navy is scheduled to give San Francisco control of the property in 1997, according to Lozeau. "We think that obviously someone should put a little pressure on the Navy to take care of this problem before they hand off the island to San Francisco," Lozeau said. No one has yet determined how much waste has leaked into the ground or the bay, but each day that any of it remains counts as a separate violation of the laws. The failure to clean up the mess violates the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act and other federal statutes, says Loseau. The cost of cleaning up all Bay Area naval bases may exceed $2 billion, he said.

By Demian BulwaCaptionCloseBay Area residents can expect to remain mired in a smoky haze this weekend as nearly 1,100 wildfires chew up 250 square miles of land around Northern California. For those most sensitive, the foul air could pose health risks, pollution regulators and meteorologists said Thursday. Temperatures are expected to top out in the 80s and even the 90s in hot spots like Livermore, which would make for great summer weather, "if only you could breathe," said Diana Henderson, a National Weather Service forecaster.Existing fires continued to spread Thursday, even as new fires were discovered. And state and federal fire officials said they were preparing for the return of the same dry thunderstorms that sparked most of the recent blazes. The storms were expected to bring lightning strikes starting late Thursday and continuing through the weekend. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District said it expects pollution levels to remain unhealthy today in portions of Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, Solano and Sonoma counties. People who are very young or old, or suffer from lung or heart disease, are most at risk. Of particular concern, said agency spokesman Aaron Richardson, are smoke particles smaller than 1/20th of the diameter of a human hair that are not filtered out of the body by the nose or throat, and may pass into the bloodstream.Concern about polluted air was one reason why organizers canceled Saturday's 100-mile Western States Endurance Run. The famous footrace from Squaw Valley to Auburn was scrapped for the first time in its 35-year history because of the "health risks that have been associated with these wildfires," race officials said in a statement.As of Thursday afternoon, officials had identified 1,088 fires in Northern California that covered 159,000 acres and destroyed at least 18 homes. More than 12,500 state and federal firefighters were on the job, with 68 helicopters and 14 airplanes dropping water and retardant liquid. Closures were in place on Highways 32, 36, 70, 89 and 96 and 299.One of the smokiest fires continued to grow in Lake and Colusa counties. The Walker Fire was just 10 percent contained and had the potential to shut down Highway 20 and burn more than 30,000 acres - or nearly 50 square miles - as it moved north through steep and rugged terrain, the state's firefighting agency said.The Walker Fire had not destroyed any homes in the remote area, and the popular Wilbur Hot Springs resort that was evacuated was spared, said Roger Archey, a spokesman for the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. On Thursday, he said, the two-lane Highway 20 remained open, but was crowded with emergency vehicles and choked with smoke from the blaze.As of Thursday morning, Archey said, nearly 600 firefighters had reported to the blaze, using five helicopters to drop water and 21 bulldozers to carve out wide perimeter lines, attempting to stop the fire's advance. The cause remained under investigation, though it was reported earlier as lightning."It's really gnarly country, a lot of brush and chaparral and steep terrain," Archey said. "There are fast-burning fuel types that are problematic, obviously."Another major concern was the Eagle Fire in Shasta-Trinity National Forest, which jumped Highway 299 on Wednesday and prompted the closure of a stretch of the roadway as well as evacuations near Junction City.In Monterey County, both directions of Highway 1 south of Big Sur remained closed in a 12-mile stretch because of what is now known as the Basin Complex of fires in Los Padres National Forest. The highway is likely to stay shut for several more days, according to Caltrans.The possibility of the flames traveling about a mile west and reaching Big Sur lessened Thursday, though the combined fires had burned 24,000 acres and are only 3 percent contained, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman said.The fire, which has destroyed 16 homes, is considered to be in the southern part of California and is thus not included in the damage report for Northern California.To view a map showing significant fires in California, go to sfgate.com/maps/fires2008

Jane Kay, Chronicle Environment WriterCaptionCloseCalifornians are in denial about their cars, according to a new poll: Although they are deeply concerned about air pollution, few see their own vehicles as part of the problem. Fifty-eight percent of residents believe that air pollution is a serious health threat, according to the poll by the Public Policy Institute of California. And most believe that auto emissions are the primary cause. Yet fewer than half believe that their own vehicle pollutes too much. That was one of the findings of a wide-ranging survey on attitudes about the environment, which found air pollution topping the list of concerns. The telephone poll of 2,002 California adult residents, interviewed in English and Spanish, was released Wednesday by the Institute, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research group that studies topics ranging from the economy and education to poverty and welfare. The reason for the disconnect, said survey director Mark Baldassare, is the deep attachment Californians have for their cars. "California culture revolves around cars, in many ways," Baldassare said. But other responses indicate a growing alarm about the health effects of breathing dirty air, and Baldassare said that some residents might be ready to "break the cycle." Three-quarters of Californians say they would be willing to see tougher air pollution standards on new cars, trucks and SUVs, and 65 percent say they would favor them even if it made the vehicles more expensive. Generally, Californians are more environmentally friendly than the nation as a whole, the poll found. Sixty-five percent say environmental protection should be given priority, even at the risk of curbing economic growth, compared with 47 percent of Americans in a recent Gallup poll. The poll results showed preferences vary for car size statewide. Thirty percent of Californians -- and 34 percent of Bay Area residents -- drive a compact car. Twenty-five percent drive a midsize car, and 8 percent a full-size car. Twenty-nine percent of state residents drive a van, pickup or SUV. Only 7 percent said they don't drive. Twenty-one percent report owning or leasing an SUV. Californians are not big on public transit, but they want to do better. Seventy-three percent of employed residents report that they usually commute to work by driving alone, 13 percent participate in a carpool, and only 5 percent take public transit. But when questioned about changing habits to help the environment, 45 percent of Californians in the workforce said they would seriously consider regularly using public transit for their commute to cut air pollution and fuel use. The poll found that younger and lower-income residents were more willing than older and wealthier ones to consider commuting by public transit. There were only slight differences among geographic areas in the amount that people drive. And regardless of where people live, or how much time they spend commuting, most Californians said they enjoy driving. "Across the state, Los Angeles residents spend more time behind the wheel than others, but large proportions of residents in every region spend a significant amount of time in their vehicles," the poll said.

Laura Hamburg, Chronicle Staff WriterCaptionClose1999-02-02 04:00:00 PDT BAY AREA -- Last week, when the sun was shining and the fish were jumping, the Hunter-McElroy family reeled in so many Kingfish off the Seventh Street Pier in Oakland that they threw a fish-fry party on Super Bowl Sunday. The problem is that the Kingfish, like many of the fish in San Francisco Bay, were contaminated with a toxic byproduct called dioxin, which can cause cancer. But local governments are considering a regional attack on dioxin. Tonight, the Oakland City Council will consider a resolution to stop future dioxin pollution. San Francisco supervisors will take up a similar resolution later this month. The Bay Area discussions come on the heels of the federal Environmental Protection Agency's proposal in November to make controlling dioxinlike compounds in the bay a "high priority." The federal watchdog agency and the state EPA found dioxin in the Bay Area's air and water beginning in 1994. A byproduct of burning plastics, refining oil, bleaching paper and driving diesel-powered vehicles, among other sources, dioxin ac cumulates in the bay's sediment and works its way through the food chain, eventually lodging in the fatty tissue of fish. But getting rid of the chemical is difficult because it remains in the ecosystem for generations. "It's a massive health problem that affects every man, woman and child and thousands of people who fish the bay for food," said Greg Karras of Communities for a Better Environment, a San Francisco environmental group. "If Oakland and San Francisco can take the lead on this and say here's what we're specifically going to do to eliminate dioxin, it will be a model for the nation and the industrial world." If both cities approve the resolutions, there are plans to form a regional task force made up of industry leaders, environmentalists and regulatory agencies. The problems facing everyone from scientists to government officials are: How to get rid of dioxin; and how much dioxin is harmful? The regional task force would encourage businesses to find alternatives to materials that emit dioxin when they are burned. Another hope is to eliminate the stuff that produces dioxin. For example, paper manufacturers could be persuaded to use hydrogen peroxide instead of chlorine to bleach paper. Hospitals also could invest in reusable hospital plastic products instead of tossing them out only to be burned later in an incinerator. Dioxin occurs when chlorinated waste is burned and when other organic chemicals that contain chlorine are manufactured. Dioxin rained down on Vietnam in the defoliant Agent Orange in the 1970s. It also spewed from an explosion and leak at a chemical plant in Seveso, Italy, in July 1976, killing farm animals and causing skin diseases among the villagers. After decades of widespread use of now-banned herbicides and unregulated industrial processes, scientists believe that all people have some dioxin stored in fatty tissue, said Dr. Rajiv Bhatia of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. Dioxin is linked to numerous health problems including birth defects, endometriosis, cancer, hormonal changes, smaller testicle size, immune system and learning problems, according to the Experimental Toxicology Division of the federal EPA. But experts differ over how much dioxin our bodies can handle and what the worst dioxin-polluting culprits are. Environmentalists say the refineries and medical waste incinerators are to blame, while some regulators say the culprits are diesel engines and wood-burning. "If you put together 10 scientists in a room and asked them to name the top 10 sources of dioxin, there would be unanimous agreement," said Robert Stephens, a scientist at the state Department of Toxic Substances Control. "But if you asked the same scientists to rank the sources, they would come up with 10 different lists." That is why lobbying groups representing the chlorine and plastic industries want to tweak the resolutions sponsored by Oakland Councilwoman Nancy Nadel and by San Francisco Supervisors Gavin Newsom, Mark Leno and Sue Bierman. While industry groups support the idea of a regional task force to deal with dioxin pollution, they hope to eliminate references that point fingers at plastic and paper manufacturers. "We know dioxin is bad, and we know there are problems in Oakland and in the Bay Area," said Jim Ross, spokesman for the Chlorine Chemistry Council. "But to pick on my client -- pulp and paper mills -- when they are already moving forward on dioxin elimination is unfair." Valeria Hunter, an Oakland mother of four teenagers, does not care about the squabble over who is to blame for the dioxin poisoning of the fish she catches in the bay. She just wants the contamination to stop. "They've got to do something about the pollution," she said last week, casting her line off the Seventh Street Pier. Hunter has been fishing the bay for 15 years. Her kids fish. Her 8- year-old nephew Alphonso Nears fishes. So does her husband, William McElroy. The family fishes a couple of times a week. One moonlit night, the family caught 13 sharks, which ended up the family dinner table. "I love to fish. Love to eat it. Love everything about it," Hunter said. "But now you've got to limit how much you eat, especially if you're pregnant or breast-feeding. They got that big ol' yellow sign out there warning people." State and local regulatory groups put up signs warning people in six languages to limit the amount of fish consumed out of the bay to two meals a month. But most of the 1,000 or more people who fish the bay eat a lot more fish than that, according to studies conducted by Communities for a Better Environment and two other environmental groups. The studies, which surveyed the fishing habits of hundreds of bay anglers from 1993 to 1997, reached similar conclusions: Most people who fish the bay eat their catch. Most anglers are people of color -- the Richmond Laotian community, Chinese Americans who live in San Francisco and African Americans from Oakland and Richmond. Many are low-income. "The CEOs of the oil companies don't eat fish out of the bay. They fly-fish in British Columbia and Montana," said Karras of Communities for a Better Environment. "There's something very wrong when we have this world-class food resource in our back yard and it's too polluted to eat from."

Beth GreerAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, the air we breathe inside our homes could be as much as five times as polluted as the air outside. One major reason: Common cleaning products contain chemicals that can be more dangerous than the germs themselves. Every time our children roll around on the carpet or our pets lick crumbs off the floor, they are being exposed to chemicals. Many of us, in our zeal to make our homes a safe haven, take clean to an extreme. Each year, according to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, the average American uses approximately 25 gallons of toxic and hazardous chemical products at home, much of which is eventually washed down the sink, flushed down the toilet or placed in a garbage can, potentially affecting the health of the people, plants, animals, land and water in and around our neighborhoods. The department contends that of the roughly 17,000 chemicals found in common household products, only 3 in 10 have been tested for their effects on human health. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is the agency responsible for the safety of consumers using thousands of products -- from toys and cribs to power tools and household chemicals. The commission does not require manufacturers to test household cleaning products before they appear on store shelves, so much of the information consumers have about a product comes from its label. Labels are required to provide hazard symbols, such as "poison" and "flammable," and must give information about first aid treatments for those ingredients. But according to the Children's Health Environmental Coalition, a national nonprofit that educates the public on environmental toxins that affect children's health, labels often omit inactive or inert ingredients that can make up as much as 90 percent of a product's volume. These include solvents, dispersal agents, dyes and fragrances, some of which can pollute the air and water. Other ingredients can be suspected carcinogens or worsen long-term health problems such as allergies and asthma. Diethyl phthalate, commonly found in commercial cleaning products, is a known endocrine-disrupting chemical (which can interfere with normal growth and development). Toluene, a chemical found in some stain removers, has been classified by the EPA as a carcinogen -- and studies have linked it to neurological problems and birth defects. Another thing to watch out for are aerosol sprays that contain flammable and nerve-damaging ingredients such as hexane and xylene. Also, aerosol sprays produce mist particles that can contain a high proportion of organic solvents, according to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. It warns that these solvents can be inhaled into the lungs and enter the bloodstream. According to a 1999 study published in the weekly science and technology magazine New Scientist, in homes where aerosol sprays and air fresheners were used frequently, mothers experienced 25 percent more headaches and were 19 percent more likely to suffer from depression, and infants younger than 6 months old had 30 percent more ear infections and a 22 percent higher incidence of diarrhea. Labels provide only limited information, but there are other ways to make sure you're keeping your family safe from indoor pollutants. They include: -- Be wary of products that make cleaning too easy. If you don't need to scrub at least a little bit, you should question why. These cleansers can emit fumes (even while stored) that can affect a home's air quality. -- Air fresheners contain synthetic fragrances, or phthalates, chemicals that have been linked to cancer and reproductive-system harm in rodents. Some groups cite evidence linking phthalates to the same problems in humans. While it shouldn't be assumed that because an item is on the shelf it has been tested for safety, you also shouldn't assume that if it says "natural" it's safe. The word "natural" is undefined and unregulated by the government and can be applied to just about anything. Because no standards exist, claims like "eco-safe" and "environmentally friendly" are also meaningless, says the Consumers Union. Since only food and herbs can be certified organic, the word "organic" on the label of a dish or laundry soap doesn't mean much. Most conventional dish and laundry detergents are made from petroleum, a nonrenewable synthetic resource, so look for naturally derived or plant-based formulas that are biodegradable and contain no phosphates. Fabric dryer sheets and potpourri that list "fragrance" on the label mean that synthetic (i.e., petroleum-based) chemicals were used, and they should be avoided. Choose "non-chlorine bleach" cleaning solutions and scouring powders. Fumes of cleansers containing a high concentration of chlorine can irritate the lungs, which is dangerous for those with asthma, emphysema or a heart condition. The risks are compounded when the cleansers are used in small, poorly ventilated rooms, such as the bathroom. Fragranced chlorine bleaches are even worse because the odor is disguised, which can lead to dangerous overexposure. If you use air fresheners, try using non-aerosol citrus sprays containing only citrus peel extracts, which are effective at dissolving airborne odors. Try an open box of baking soda to remove odors, or use sachets of dried flowers and herbs, or lavender essential oil, which will provide gentle scents. White vinegar, borax, salt, herbs, olive oil, cornstarch and lemon juice have been used as cleansers for decades and have proved to be effective and safer for humans, pets and the environment. If all this seems overwhelming, think about just one "healthy" cleaning product you can buy today and commit yourself to buying it. This small, simple act could have a big effect on your family's health. -- Recipes to make environmentally safe cleansers from oven cleaners to mildew removers can be found online at: www.care2.com, www.almanac.com (hit the Food button, then scroll down to "Kitchen Tips and Tricks" and click on the "helpful advice and handy kitchen hints link") and www.organizedhome.com. -- Information about safe cleaning products can be found at: www.greenhome.com, www.checnet.org (Children's Health Environmental Coalition), www.householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov and www.kidsorganics.com/Chemicals%20to%20Avoid.htm. -- You can find environmentally safe products from Bon Ami, Ecover, Seventh Generation, BioShield, Earth Friendly and Greenwood Naturals (a lavender-based product developed by the Greenwood School in Mill Valley and produced by EO).

Chronicle Staff ReportThinking about the holidays invariably invokes images of family and friends gathered round the hearth enjoying a cozy fire. That's a pleasant image from the inside, but outdoors the reality is much harsher, according to the Bay Area Clean Water Agencies and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. That warm, friendly fire is actually spewing particulate matter on surrounding neighborhoods -- fouling the air, causing breathing problems and polluting the San Francisco Bay watershed. "While wood burning may not readily jump to mind as a source of pollution, it can have serious consequences for Bay Area waterways," says Phil Bobel of the Clean Water Agencies. "Wood burning is a major source of dioxin, one of the most toxic chemicals known. Let's give the bay a break and create holiday ambience with strings of lights and the aroma of hot apple cider." How does the pollution occur? Dioxins are formed and released into the air from the combustion processes of burning wood. Just as water moves through the hydrological cycle, toxic pollutants follow the same path. Once released into water, dioxins break down very slowly and bio-accumulate in the food chain. The higher in the food chain one goes, the higher is the concentration of dioxins, Brosseau explains. Jack Broadbent, the Air District's executive officer, echoes this point. "Wood burning is a major source of wintertime air pollution in this region," said Broadbent. "Wood smoke pollutes the air both inside and outside a home. Elderly people, children and people with asthma are particularly susceptible to health problems when wood is being burned." Wood smoke causes air pollution mostly on cold nights with little wind -- common weather conditions in winter months. These stagnant conditions can last for days. This is a big problem in California valleys. With little or no wind, warm air layers act as a lid over the cold air in the valleys, trapping smoke from woodstoves and fireplaces close to the ground. To help inspire residents to give up burning wood, the air quality district is administering a rebate program for Santa Clara County residents who replace their wood-burning fireplace or pre-1991 wood stove with one that uses natural gas instead. The rebates are $300 to $500 and interested residents can go to www.sparetheair.org for more information on participating retailers. Both agencies stress that all residents can easily reduce pollution over the holidays. Here are some tips: -- Break the wood-burning habit this year and don't burn wood. -- If you must use wood, burn less and use only clean, seasoned wood, and non-glossy white paper. -- Never burn garbage, plastics, rubber, waste solvent, paint, oil, painted or treated wood, particle board, plywood or glossy or colored paper. Burning these materials can produce noxious, corrosive smoke and fumes, which may be toxic. -- Make a pollution-free choice and switch to a gas fireplace or insert.

Michele Driscoll AliotoGardening can be a healthy, stress-reducing hobby that provides good exercise and nourishment for both the body and soul. It's also a pastime that calls for caution in at least one area, especially where children are concerned. Contamination of garden soil with lead, a highly toxic substance, is not an uncommon problem. Lead poisoning is especially dangerous for children and is insidious because most people don't show symptoms initially. Elevated blood levels in children can cause a wide variety of developmental and behavioral problems, including diminished hearing, growth and IQ. Extremely high blood levels can be fatal. Checking to see if your garden soil has been polluted can be a wise and healthy decision. Soil can be contaminated if it is near older homes, areas with heavy auto traffic, or certain types of industry. Gardens close to homes that were painted with exterior lead-based paint often have high levels of lead in the soil. Lead-based paint enters the soil by way of chipping and natural weathering, removal of paint by scraping and sand blasting, or a structure's demolition. Most of us know that older paint often contains lead and that children who eat paint chips are at risk. Keeping chips out of a child's mouth however, doesn't solve the problem. When lead-based paint peels and falls from a building's exterior, it eventually pulverizes and the surrounding soil becomes contaminated. During the years that automobiles burned leaded gasoline and lead was being released by industries, tons of lead wnt into the atmosphere and settled into the soil. Lead does not break down or wash away. Despite the fact that leaded gasoline and lead-based paint have been banned for almost 20 years, the consequences of its use are still with us. The good news is that there are relatively easy, attractive ways to keep your family and pets safe and your garden thriving. Protect your family. If you suspect you might have high levels of lead in your soil and have children who play in the garden, you should have your children screened for blood lead levels and speak with your doctor about the results. Enforce a clean-hands policy and insist that children wash when they come in from outside. It is estimated that children ingest up to 190 mg a day of soil under normal living conditions. Teach your children not to eat soil or put their hands in their mouths. Providing children with a covered sandbox will often discourage playing in the soil. Be aware of other potential sources of lead exposure at day care centers, schools and homes of friends and relatives. Don't let pets or children drag soil into the home. Feed children before sending them out into the garden. Studies have shown that if lead is ingested on an empty stomach the body absorbs up to 80 percent; on a full stomach the body absorbs only 10 percent. Good gardening practices. Have your soil tested for lead, PH and phosphorus levels. Tests can be done through the county extension office or through a certified private soil-testing laboratory. Position vegetable gardens away from roads, driveways and old painted structures. Grow leafy greens and other hard-to-wash vegetables far from the street. Although many edible garden plants do not absorb lead, it is advisable to grow vegetables in raised beds with organic, lead-free soil. All produce should be carefully washed in vinegar and water, especially roots and the crinkled areas of leafy vegetables. Fruiting crops such as tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers and beans will absorb fewer toxins in general than leafy vegetables and root crops such as carrots and radishes. If lead-based paint is found on a home's exterior, the highest levels of paint residue are usually found within a few feet of the foundation. The soil of these areas can either be replaced or covered with a plastic barrier and then covered with rocks or other decorative landscaping materials. Keep bare soil to a minimum with lawns, ground covers and other materials such as crushed rock. Learn to love mulching. Most contaminated soil is usually found in the top inches of topsoil. A layer of compost or mulch will hold down lead particles and keep the exposure to a minimum.

By Anna Bisaro abisaro@newhavenregister.com @annabisaro on TwitterCaptionCloseNEW HAVEN >> As Aly Tatchol Camara biked to the very edge of Criscuolo Park, fishing poles slung on his back, he found he would not be alone at Grape Vine Point this cold, March evening.Two poles already rested on the stone wall, lines dropped into where the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers meet before emptying into Long Island Sound. A 13-year-old boy told Camara through his shivering that he hadn’t had any luck yet that night in catching anything. The boy said he was there to try to bring fish home to his family. Just to the right of the poles was a sign from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection warning that if anyone spots raw sewage in the water, they are to call and report the sighting. Combined sewer overflows, contaminated storm water runoff, lawn fertilizers and lingering chemicals from dozens of power and manufacturing plants are just some of the pollutants hurting Greater New Haven watersheds. All three rivers in Greater New Haven — West, Mill and Quinnipiac — are on the impaired waters list of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  While pollution limits activities like swimming and paddling in these rivers, it also poses a significant risk to those who consume fish from them. The state Department of Public Health advises that any fish caught from the Quinnipiac River should be consumed only once a month, due to the dangerous contaminants present in fish tissue. Blue crab from the Mill River should not be eaten at all, the department warns in its 2016 consumption guide.  Camara, 51, said it was still a little too early in the year to catch much, but he said he likes spending his summer evenings at the edge of Criscuolo Park. A native of West Africa, Camara has been in the United States since 1996, he said, and he now teaches African dance and drumming in New Haven.He mostly fishes for sport, releasing much of what he gets, he said. Fishing in the evenings keeps him away from television and out of trouble, he said with a laugh.  “This is a place for us to spend time,” Camara said. “You meet a lot of friends here.”Based on the health advisories from the state health department for 2016, fish in the Quinnipiac may be contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, commonly referred to as PCBs. The recommendation that any species of fish caught in the river only be consumed once a month applies to both high-risk and low-risk groups. The high-risk group noted in the consumption guide includes pregnant women, women planning pregnancy within one year, nursing women and children under age 6. Anglers are reminded that long-term exposure to PCBs can lead to increased risk of developing cancers and can have a negative impact on children’s cognitive development.   “The High Risk Group should eat no more than one fish meal per month of most freshwater fish from local waters,” the guide notes. Low-risk groups are generally recommended to stick to one freshwater fish meal per week, if the fish is caught in Connecticut freshwater bodies. Brian Toal, an epidemiologist for the state health department, explained that the once-per-month rule can be flexible in regard to an entire year. Basically, he said, someone should not consume more than 12 fish from the Quinnipiac River over the course of one year. Toal explained that PCBs could have adverse effects on unborn children, especially in terms of cognitive health, and that is why pregnant women are warned to stay away from those freshwater fish. The PCBs in Quinnipiac fish are a lingering result of manufacturing plants along the river, Toal said. And for saltwater fish, striped bass and bluefish, for example, the PCBs are likely accumulated from deposits from rivers in Connecticut and New York. There’s enough in the environment of the Sound to contaminate the fish, Toal said. According to state Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, founder of the River Advocates of South Central Connecticut, PCBs in waterways can linger for a very long time — long after plants have even discharged the chemicals. They linger in the sediment on the bottoms of the rivers or bays, she said, and are very expensive to clean up. PCBs can travel from fish to fish, Mushinsky said, making fish further up the food chain even more dangerous. She explained that striped bass that make their way up the rivers from the Sound are likely chasing smaller, migratory fish that are headed upstream to spawn. “The higher you are up in the food chain, the more likely to have (contaminated) material in the body, and striped bass are pretty high on the food chain,” Mushinsky said. “They have picked up contaminants in their ocean life.” While there has been some success in cleaning the upper Quinnipiac River of the PCB threat, not all Connecticut waterways at risk of that type of contamination have been as lucky, Toal said. The other rivers and lakes with fish at risk of PCB contamination include the Housatonic River above Lake Lillinonah and the lakes on the Housatonic, Furnace Brook in Cornwall, Blackberry River in North Canaan,  the Connecticut River and the Little River and connected Versailles Pond and Papermill Pond, according to the health guide.  To educate the public about these potential dangers, Toal said DEEP and the health department post signs in popular fishing locations and have the consumption guide available online.For weeks leading up to opening day on April 9, DEEP is stocking Connecticut waterways — roughly 100 lakes and ponds and about 200 streams and rivers — with trout. A fresh stock of about 700,000 fish is needed every spring as the fish usually don’t make it until the next year, said Brian Eltz, an inland fisheries biologist at DEEP. This fact, and their breeding in hatcheries, makes them safe to eat. It is generally recommended that trout stretching more than 15 inches long not be consumed, according to Toal. If trout have reached that size, they might have been in rivers long enough to pick up harmful pollutants, he said. “Most trout stocked are caught pretty quickly and don’t have time to accumulate” contaminants, Toal said. But, according to the fish-consumption guide from the health department, published online, no trout from the Housatonic River should be consumed. DEEP continues to stock throughout the year, as fishing season in Connecticut is only closed for March and the first part of April, Eltz said.  “A majority of our waters do not support wild reproduction of trout,” Eltz said, citing water temperature and habitat as the reasons, rather than potential pollutants. Trout need cooler waters to thrive and generally spawn in riffled habitats, he said. “It’s too warm and too shallow to sustain a trout population,” said David James, president of the Quinnipiac River Watershed Association. “If you catch a trout in the Quinnipiac River, it’s stocked.”James added that he has never been concerned about health implications of eating a trout caught in the Quinnipiac.But for those areas that are starting to have trout populations return year after year, like the section of the Mill River that runs through Hamden, fishermen are only able to catch and release so as not to threaten this growing population, Eltz said. But, Eltz said, it seems that the catch-and-release trend is growing even in other water bodies where anglers are permitted to catch and keep. “I think people think it’s better for the environment,” Eltz said. James said he sees a lot of fishermen catching and releasing, but there are also people taking what they catch home — and not just trout. “People all over here eat fish caught out of the Quinnipiac all the time,” James said. He said he believes people eat perch and bass mostly from the Quinnipiac River. More than 100 years ago, there were 71 businesses that had permits allowing them to discharge waste into the Quinnipiac River. That number is down to six today. Three of those discharges include chemicals from manufacturing, according to a report completed by Mushinsky about the status of Greater New Haven rivers in June 2015. One of the goals of the River Advocates for South Central Connecticut, of which Mushinsky is the director, is to track these permits and get the public involved in hearings surrounding proposed discharges. The permits for waste discharges have to be renewed every five years and the public has only then to comment on the status or content of the permit. Companies are “allowed permits if discharge does not affect animals that are oversensitive to pollution,” Mushinsky said. But, the public “has to make sure the permit is strong and does rely  on live organisms.” In a recent case, Allnex USA applied for a permit modification, and Mushinsky and other advocates took action. A petition was submitted requesting a public hearing about a new chemical the company has requested permission to discharge into the Quinnipiac. Because the chemical is newly developed, there are no limits on the amount that can be discharged at this time. DEEP officials told the Register last month that the discharge would be monitored and water quality tested to check on the potential effects to fish and wildlife. DEEP will hold a status conference April 7 to discuss when a public hearing might take place, according to DEEP Communications Director Dennis Schain. In her assessment of the Quinnipiac, Mill and West rivers, Mushinsky found there were threats from other human sources, not just manufacturing, that were hurting the health of the watersheds. Bacteria, nitrogen, suspended solids and phosphorus — all pollutants that affect water quality — can come from septic systems, lawn fertilizers, landfills and even pet waste.But things in the rivers of Greater New Haven are not as bad as they used to be, Mushinsky said. Thanks to the Clean Water Act, there have been major efforts to limit and clean up major contaminants and the fish populations are starting to thrive again, she said, as indicated by the presence of bald eagles, osprey and other predators in the watersheds. And there are enough fish to keep local fishermen in Fair Haven going all summer long. The end of James Street in Criscuolo Park is packed with as many fishermen as will fit in warm weather, said Sean Random, 37, of New Haven, who stopped by the park one March evening before sunset.“They don’t bite too good when it’s cold,” Random said. But, once it gets warm, he said, it’s the best place to fish in New Haven. He added that he enjoys grilling striped bass the most. Oftentimes, he will release what he catches in salt water, he said, but any big “river monsters” he catches, he likes to take home and grill. “When I was younger, we used to fish to eat,” Random said. “Now that I’m older, I fish for sport, but I still like to eat them.”

Michael Kunzelman, Associated PressCaptionCloseEds: Adds details, comments and background. With AP Photos. AP Video.NEW ORLEANS (AP) - The focus of a trial over BP's massive 2010 oil spill has shifted from the causes of the deadly disaster to the company's struggle to plug its blown-out well while millions of gallons of crude gushed into the Gulf of Mexico for nearly three months.The trial's second phase opened Monday with claims that BP could have capped the well much sooner if it hadn't ignored decades of warnings about the risks of a deep-water blowout or withheld crucial information about the size of the spill from federal officials.BP attorney Mike Brock denied those allegations and said the company's efforts to stop the flow of oil were guided by an overriding principle: "Don't make it worse.""It was what the government instructed us to do," Brock told U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier.The April 20, 2010, blowout triggered an explosion that killed 11 workers on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and spawned the nation's worst offshore oil spill. BP used a capping stack to seal the well July 15 after other methods failed.Brian Barr, an attorney for residents and businesses who claim they were hurt by the spill, said BP treated the Gulf like its own "private laboratory" as its engineers tried in vain to stop the flow of oil. BP had a 600-page oil spill response plan that only included one page on "source control," but it simply called for assembling a team of experts to devise a way to stop a blowout, Barr said."BP's plan was nothing more than a plan to plan," he said.The trial's first phase, which lasted eight weeks before ending in April, included testimony from high-ranking company officials and rig workers who survived the explosion. It focused on the complex chain of mistakes and failures that caused the blowout.The second phase is divided into two segments: The first, scheduled to last four days, centers on BP's efforts to cap the well. The second, expected to last three weeks, is designed to help Barbier determine how much oil spilled into the Gulf.The government's estimate is some 70 million gallons more than what BP says spilled. Establishing how much oil leaked into the Gulf will help figure out the penalties the oil company must pay. Billions of dollars are at stake.In May 2010, BP tried in vain to use the "top kill" method to stop the flow of oil by pumping mud and other material into the blowout preventer. Plaintiffs' lawyers claim BP knew the strategy was doomed to fail based on higher flow rate estimates that the company didn't share with federal officials at the time."Nevertheless, BP pressed ahead and falsely claimed that it was a slam dunk," said Brad Brian, an attorney for rig owner Transocean.A week after the spill started, high-ranking BP official Doug Suttles told Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry that the company estimated oil was flowing at a rate of 1,000 to 5,000 barrels per day. But the company's adversaries at the trial say BP's own internal documents and emails show an effort to conceal much higher estimates."BP's policy of not releasing the flow rate information was enforced at the highest levels of the company," Brian said, pointing to an email that a BP employee sent to BP Exploration and Production CEO Andy Inglis and his assistant on May 15.The employee, Mike Mason, warned them that they should be "very cautious" standing behind the lower estimate because his team's models showed estimates that were up to 20 times higher.Mason said he was called in for a meeting the following day with Inglis' assistant, who suggested he should not have put his warning in writing. When Mason asked what the problem was, the assistant replied, "It's the big number," Mason recalled in videotaped testimony that was shown in court Monday.The top kill was among several methods that didn't work. Other attempts, such as the Cofferdam and the "top hat," also failed. The terms were obscure industry jargon before the spill but became buzzwords as the company scrambled to find a way to plug the well.Under the Clean Water Act, a polluter can be forced to pay a maximum of either $1,100 or $4,300 per barrel of spilled oil. The higher maximum applies if the company is found grossly negligent, as the government argues BP should be. But the penalties can be assessed at amounts lower than those caps. Congress passed a law dictating that 80 percent of the Clean Water Act penalties paid by BP must be divided among the Gulf states.The Justice Department's experts estimate 4.2 million barrels, or 176 million gallons, spilled into the Gulf. BP has urged Judge Barbier to use an estimate of 2.45 million barrels, or nearly 103 million gallons, in calculating any Clean Water Act fines. Both sides agree that 810,000 barrels, or 34 million gallons, was captured before it could pollute the Gulf.Using the government's figures, a maximum penalty if the company is found negligent could total $18 billion. Using the company's figures, that maximum penalty would be around $10.5 billion.In late July, BP reported a second quarter net profit of $2 billion as lower oil prices, higher taxes and a drop in income from its operations in Russia took their toll on the company. The company has already set aside more than $42 billion for the oil spill, including damage claims from residents and businesses.

By SUSAN PHINNEY, P-I REPORTEREight months ago, 10 Washingtonians volunteered blood, urine and hair samples to the Washington Toxics Coalition to be tested for eight classes of chemicals.The results are in, and they are not pretty.It wouldn't be kind to say that these 10 are walking toxic waste dumps, but their levels of phthalates (found in such diverse products as shower curtains and fragrances), PBDEs (found in flame retardants, mattresses and furniture), mercury, pesticides, lead and other chemicals were high enough to make both scientists and subjects sit up and take notice.All 10 tested positive for five to seven of those eight categories. Their profiles and test results have been published in a Pollution in People report, a project of the Toxic-Free Legacy Coalition of Washington State. At a news conference Tuesday, they shared their stories and reactions to the results, expressing shock, sadness, relief, alarm and opinions on what should be done.Dr. Patricia Dawson, 56, a Seattle surgeon, had the dubious honor of having 38 chemicals detected in her chemical profile. Her PBDE levels were near those found to cause reproductive problems in laboratory animals. Her levels of DDT (banned since 1972) were greater than 90 percent of the U.S. population.According to her "participant profile," Dawson, a native of Jamaica, was exposed to DDT trucks as a child. "I'm shocked. I eat organic and try to have a healthy lifestyle," she said.Denis Hayes, president of the Bullitt Foundation and a founder of Earth Day, was found to have mercury above a level deemed safe by the Environmental Protection Agency. Mercury has the potential for causing learning deficits."My reaction was relief and alarm -- relief that I'm not planning on having more children and alarm that I'm likely to be buried in a toxic waste dump," said Hayes, 61. Deb Abrahamson, 51, a Native American living on the Spokane Indian Reservation, and the Rev. Ann Holmes Redding, 54, of Seattle, were found to have very high levels of pesticides. Abrahamson said she had been worried about exposure to uranium, which is mined near her home. Instead, she learned that she should have been concerned about apples and grapes -- possible sources of the pesticides. She said the tribal store doesn't carry organic produce, which is too expensive for many.Abrahamson said the EPA had already identified 28 heavy metals polluting the reservation, and pesticides are a concern because they can contaminate camas, a traditional Native America food plant, and other cultural food sources. "Practicing the cultural lifestyle leads to more exposure," she said. The deer, elk and moose they harvest and eat can also ingest toxic chemicals in the environment.Redding, a state resident for five years, grew up in an agricultural area of New Jersey, a likely reason for her high pesticide levels. She said she was alarmed and felt powerless about the test results, but she said that as an Episcopal priest, she is in a position to alert people to toxic chemicals in the environment.She said it was the persistence of banned chemicals that bothered her most.Karen Bowman, 53, is a Seattle-based occupational and environmental health nurse. She tested positive for 35 chemicals and had high levels of phthalates, which are found in vinyl/PVC and personal care products.It is her job to protect workers in construction and steel mills and those who work with paints, sealants and epoxies. She said her work has increased her exposure to phthalates. "It's scary. I do the right things: Change clothes, use a respirator and other barrier control measures. It demonstrates how insidious the problem of chemical exposure is," Bowman said.Rob Duff, director of the office of environmental health assessments for the state Department of Health, was not involved in the study, but he said it illustrates "that we have these things in our bodies that really shouldn't be there." "There's something wrong with how we regulate chemicals in this country. While it's difficult for states to impact that, we can identify the worst of the worst and take action. We need to think strategically to keep from allowing the next harmful chemical to get out there and be used. We need to work with manufacturers and the federal government to change the way we put chemicals into commerce," Duff said.Erika Schreder, staff scientist at the Washington Toxics Coalition, said Pollution in People was the first investigation of its kind in the state, but the results were comparable to those found in other, larger studies conducted biannually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Schreder and study participants had suggestions for avoiding toxic chemicals. Contaminated fish were on the list. So were beauty products from companies not committed to toxic-free ingredients. One woman even pointed out that her toenails were painted with red, phthalates-free polish.Other products to avoid? Foods that aren't organic, and products made of vinyl, such as toys, shower curtains and food packaging.

Associated PressWashington Authorities say rivers tainted by last week's massive spill from an abandoned Colorado gold mine are starting to recover, but for the Environmental Protection Agency the political fallout from the disaster could linger.The federal agency's critics are already seeking to use its much-maligned handling of the mine spill to undercut the Obama administration's rollout of major regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions at the nation's power plants. Members of oversight committees in both the House and Senate say they are planning hearings after Congress returns from its August recess."The EPA is supposed to help prevent environmental catastrophes, not cause them," said Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. "But, sadly, President Obama's EPA has been too busy threatening American jobs with radical regulations instead of focusing on what should be their core mission."EPA and contract workers accidentally unleashed 3 million gallons of contaminated wastewater as they inspected the idled Gold King mine on Aug. 5, just two days after Obama unveiled his Clean Power Plan during an event at the White House.The timing could hardly be worse for the beleaguered regulatory agency, a frequent target for congressional Republicans and pro-industry groups. Attorneys general for at least 15 states say they plan to sue over the new carbon restrictions, and such coal-mining backers as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are urging states to simply ignore new carbon rules.Last week, even Democrats representing states affected by the spill have criticized the agency's response. That has forced top administration officials off-message just as they were launching an effort to sell the new carbon rules to the American people.

It's one of the most common contaminants in U.S. bodies of water, and is absorbed cumulatively in the bloodstream and up the food chain.Coal-fired power plants across the nation emitted 134,365 pounds of mercury in 2009, “far exceeding” the 10 next biggest sources of the pollutant, the report states.The EPA is expected to release new rules in March, but many Republicans in Congress are fighting the effort, claiming job loss and damage to U.S. industry.Texas and the EPA are currently fighting over which entity will oversee air quality regulation in the state after the EPA moved to take over Texas' permitting process.Today, there is no federal limit on coal plant mercury emissions, and while some states have implemented their own, Texas has not.Its 20 coal plants emit more than any other state, spewing more than 16,000 pounds of mercury into the environment in 2009.Four Texas plants made it in to the top 10 most polluting power plants in the United States in 2009, according to the report, with the Martin Lake Steam Electric Station & Lignite Mine in East Texas holding the dubious title of worst polluter in the nation, emitting 2,660 pounds of mercury.CPS Energy-owned Calaveras Power Station, which includes four individual units, Spruce 1 and 2, which came online in September, and Deely 1 and 2, belched 440 pounds of mercury into the air in 2009, according to the report and confirmed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which monitors the plants.That ranks it 11th dirtiest out of the Texas 20.That's also less mercury than the plants released in 2000, when Calaveras included just three units. That year, they sent 760 pounds of mercury into the atmosphere.Environmental controls built in to Spruce 2, and which were added to Spruce 1, and to a lesser extent the Deely units, help lower mercury emissions, even though the controls are aimed at ozone-causing nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide and fine particulate matter, which is linked to heart and lung problems.CPS says it is waiting for the EPA's new rule, and will act accordingly to stay in compliance. “Sorbent injection” controls could cost roughly $2 million per unit, the utility estimates, plus operating costs.Low levels of mercury contamination have been found in fish at Calaveras and nearby Braunig lakes and in the upper San Antonio River, and they are considered safe to eat, according to TCEQ, CPS and the San Antonio River Authority, which monitors the river.“CPS is going in the right direction,” said Sierra Club member and pharmacist Russell Seal, “but it's going to take public support to help CPS continue to go in the right direction and shut down” the Deely units.Residents must cut their own energy use to reduce demand, Seal said, which would allow CPS to shutter “Dirty Deely,” as the units are known.CPS CEO Doyle Beneby has floated the idea of closing the Deely plants many years ahead of schedule instead of spending $565 million to install sulfur dioxide scrubbers on the units, as the utility had originally planned.Spending that much would force the utility to extend the life of the units, Beneby says, whereas he would rather close them after a 40-year life and focus on other, cleaner forms of energy. The units came online in 1977 and 1978.But Seal and others remain wary.They point to the agreement CPS made a decade ago to add the scrubbers in exchange for their agreement to drop opposition to Spruce 2.They worry that CPS would not keep its word this time, either, said Karen Hadden of the Austin-based SEED Coalition, which was part of the original agreement.Another concern, she said, is that CPS would replace the lost power by buying more nuclear energy from the South Texas Project.“That would be the wrong thing to do,” she said.She said SEED, the Sierra Club and other local groups are working together “to speak with one voice” on whether to support the possible early closure.As originally published, this story contained an error.

Colin MerryCaptionCloseBy ERIC FREEDMANCapital News ServiceLANSING — Summer vacation season is upon us, with camping, hiking and other outdoor activities. For some, that means visiting remote locations in the Great Lakes region, such as Isle Royale National Park, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore.Still others set their GPS for historic locales such River Raisin National Battlefield Park in Monroe and Keweenaw National Historic Park in the western Upper Peninsula.Wherever you’re heading, there are air pollution problems, according to a new report by the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.The association examined air pollution at 417 National Park Service properties and concluded that that 96% of them “are plagued by significant air pollution problems in at least one of four categories”: unhealthy air, harm to nature, haze pollution and climate change.“Many parks suffer from the negative effects of air pollution in more than one of these categories,” it said, adding that climate change and air pollution adversely affect almost all national parks, with “fossil fuels and industrial air pollution” as the primary contributors to the problem.The report said, “While most air pollution doesn’t originate in national park, it can travel hundreds of miles from its source, thereby affecting all parks – even remote ones – and distant communities.”Superintendent Scott Tucker at Sleeping Bear Dunes said air-borne nitrogen from Milwaukee and Green Bay along the western coast of Lake Michigan is part of the problem at his park.“Even last summer we had visibility issues from wildfires in the West. It was pretty noticeable” during the filming of a new orientation movie, he said.Senior meteorologist Jim Heywood of the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy also cites interstate transportation of emissions. Monitoring by the department’s Air Quality Division in the U.P.’s Seney National Wildlife Refuge found ozone emissions from Chicago and Northwest Indiana that made their way across Lake Michigan via southwest and southerly winds.A 2015 Park Service air quality summary for Sleeping Bear Dunes said, “Human health risk from ground-level ozone warrants significant concern” and said ozone concentrations were relatively unchanged from 2006 levels. During that period, the summary showed improvement in the risk to plant life from ground-level ozone and in visibility.However, the chief of science and resource stewardship at Pictured Rocks, Bruce Leutscher, questioned the data, saying the report “didn’t do a good job of telling just where they got all their data from.”“We don’t have any local air quality monitoring stations” in the park, he said. The closest is at Seney, so “we must be grouped in with others in the region.”Leutscher said, “On the ground here at Pictured Rocks, we don’t notice or perceive or get any reports about air pollution.” For example, there have been no complaints about smog affecting the vistas in recent years. And “I don’t notice any ozone damage at ground level.”A study about seven or eight years ago did find higher levels of mercury in the water in the Munising area, the result of airborne pollutants carried from the south and southwest, he said.In its report, the National Parks Conservation Association said, “Today, air pollution is on the rise, enforcement actions against polluters have plummeted by 85%, the Environmental Protection Agency is pushing an anti-science agenda and the United States is exiting the Paris Agreement, the global climate treaty.”The Associated Press recently reported, “Around the country, the EPA under Trump is delegating a widening range of public health and environmental enforcement to states, saying local officials know best how to deal with local problems. Critics contend federal regulators are making a dangerous retreat on enforcement that puts people and the environment at greater risk. One administration initiative would give states more authority over emissions from coal-fired power plants.”While the Trump administration has relaxed environmental regulations and proposes further relaxations, Heywood noted, “you hear about loosening” of federal regulations, but “we haven’t seen that in permitting” for air emissions. And the trend over the past 20 years shows “things are consistently getting better.”Here’s the association’s assessment of sites in Michigan:•Isle Royale National Park: “significant concern” about nature and climate, and “moderate concern” about visibility and health.•Keweenaw National Historic Park: “significant concern about nature and climate; “moderate concern” about visibility and health.•Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore: “significant concern” about health, nature and climate; “moderate concern” about visibility.•River Raisin National Battlefield Park: “significant concern” about nature; “moderate concern” about health and visibility; “little to no concern” about climate.•Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore “significant concern” about health, nature and climate; “moderate concern” about visibility.

Shanna AveryCaptionCloseEditor's note: This is part three of a three-part series examining the contamination of the Wash King Laundry Superfund site near Baldwin. The first article looked at the history of the site, the second article drew attention to the current status of the site and recent PFAS contamination detected and the third article explores future actions.BALDWIN — For decades action has been taken to get the contamination at the Wash King Superfund site under control. More work needs to be done, however, before the vacant land can be used in the business community catering to tourism on the Pere Marquette River.Since PCE (perchloroethylene) and other laundry-related contaminants were discovered in the early 1970s from dry cleaning operations at Wash King Laundry south of Baldwin, local, state and federal officials made progress controlling human exposure to the toxins as well as stabilizing the migration of contaminated groundwater. While problems remain today, economic leaders say the site could be a boom to local business if and when they are successful cleaning the site.CLEANUP ACTION PLANEven though the danger of human exposure to contaminants is under control, the Wash King site is still undergoing testing, maintenance and full cleanup efforts so the land can be commercially-viable again.In the most recent action plan by Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), formerly the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, there are five potential remedies to get cleanup at the site finalized.Among the options listed is taking no action. This would leave only natural processes to reduce the contaminated concentrations in the polluted areas. Another option would be in-situ (on-site) chemical oxidation, using specific chemicals to eliminate contaminants in the soil and ground water. The chemicals would react with the PCE, producing substances such as carbon dioxide and water.In-situ chemical reduction, a third option, uses (zerovalent iron) ZVI to eliminate PCE contamination. The ZVI process filters out contaminants, leaving only uncontaminated groundwater and dissolved iron.A fourth option, on-site treatment remediation, is technology which thermally heats the ground to increase the mobility of the contaminants, allowing for more complete removal.The last option, excavation, would involve removing all surface infrastructure, vegetation and contaminated soils in the treatment zone to transport to a licensed landfill. Water removal with an off-site groundwater treatment system also would be involved. After excavation, the site would be back-filled with clean, imported soils.Which of the five avenues to proceed with for cleanup is still being determined.PRIME LOCATION IN COMMERCIAL DISTRICTAlong the Pere Marquette River, just north of the contamination site, several businesses cater to activities and tourism on the federal- and state-designated wild scenic river. Local officials would like to see the vacant Wash King site join this commercial district.Currently, deed restrictions are in place at the contaminated area, preventing use of the land for any purposes. Restrictions won't be lifted until the site is fully cleaned up.A blight structure, the old Windjammer Restaurant, was removed from the Wash King site thanks to the efforts of Pleasant Plains Township and the county to treat contamination underneath the building."The Wash King site is now a land bank property owned by the county," said Lake County Treasurer Brenda Kutchinski. "This will be in our possession until we get an okay from DEQ. They will notify me and meet with county commissioners about what is going on with the site, and they will give me the OK to sell it."The county joined Pleasant Plains Township to have a fire demolition of the old restaurant building. The fire department took it down, which helped with the cost. Clean up didn't take long at all. It is property in a commercial district, so I don't think we will have any problem selling it."Pat Williams, of the Lake County Economic Development Alliance, is hopeful the cleanup of the contaminated site will mean a positive future for business opportunities in the county."With the push for economic development geared more toward tourism, and with the area being the center of the fishing community, the land would be a good spot for some sort of retail or restaurant," she said.COMMUNITY WANTS CLOSURETownship officials, as well as members of the community, including those on the municipal well system paying for maintenance and upkeep of the system for a mistake someone else was responsible for, hope to see closure of the decades-old cleanup project.Pleasant Plains Township Trustee Clint Jackson, who spearheaded a two-year blight cleanup on the property, wants more awareness of the site at the state and national level."I hope somebody will wake up. I often wonder and think about the residents who have been affected by the contamination," he said.Efforts to restore the land have continued for some time, spanning decades of hard work, toil and care, and all involved, from residents to business owners and officials, hopeful to see these efforts provide a promising future.

Candy AllanCaptionCloseCity manager says water safe to drinkEVART — Perchlorate, a naturally-occurring chemical often found in fireworks, has been detected in Evart wells used to draw city drinking water and one of the two wells used by Ice Mountain.Ice Mountain currently uses two of Evart's 11 wells to draw water; wells 7 and 13a.The well in question, 13a, located northeast of the Osceola County 4-H FFA Fairgrounds in a wellhead protection area, was found to be contaminated after testing occurred in April by the water bottling company.Ice Mountain's standards require the water must not contain any traces of the chemical due to regulations in California and Massachusetts."We can’t guarantee where our water ends up getting sold, so want make sure our water is compliant everywhere," said Greg Fox, senior natural resources manager for Ice Mountain's Midwest region.Michigan currently does not regulate perchlorate levels."Ice Mountain paid $400,000 to $500,000 for Well 13a, but we own it," said Evart City Manager Zack Szakacs. "When they were getting ready to turn it on and start pumping, they started doing their sampling. Because they're licensed in 50 states they do different samplings than we need to do to ensure the integrity of the spring water. They sampled and perchlorate was detected in the well."While perchlorate is a naturally occurring substance, it’s not normally found in Michigan, explained Deb Muchmore, Ice Mountain spokesperson. Perchlorate is more commonly found in more arid regions such as the southwestern portion of the United States. The substance is highly soluble in water and was identified in April as part of the normal testing process as the new well was brought online to replace aging facilities.“There are two wells within the Evart well network area that are set aside for Ice Mountain. One of the two was about 56 years old and that well was being replaced as part of an ongoing maintenance program," she said. "As they were testing the finished product from the new well, independent lab analysis identified the presence of perchlorate in very small levels."The first action Ice Mountain took was sharing that information with the City of Evart, Muchmore said. After that, locating the source of the perchlorate “became the first order of business.”“The goal was to identify the source specifically and remove it, all the while maintaining the safety and quality of the water people are drinking, whether that water was being distributed by the City of Evart or bottled and sold under the Ice Mountain brand," she said.Because of the detection, Ice Mountain cannot pump water from that particular well until all traces of the chemical are gone, Szakacs added. Tests showed Well 7 was clear of the chemical.To date, Ice Mountain has spent about $750,000 on a two-pronged approach to the situation, Muchmore said."It's really important to note there's not a health risk associated with the level of perchlorate we've identified," she said. "Nevertheless, the city and Ice Mountain took immediate proactive steps and assessed the source of the perchlorate with an eye to removing it from the groundwater. People want safe drinking water now, and we're ensuring that, and they want the source removed, and we're working on that."Officials believe the chemical permeated the well due to the continued use of the fairgrounds for the annual Independence Day fireworks show."We've investigated all the options we could imagine," Fox said. "We've basically ruled out any other possibility."The residue from the explosives is pushed to the wellhead area by wind and falls on the ground. Once perchlorate lands, it's extremely water soluble."As soon as an water gets on it, it'll seep into the ground," Szakacs said.Well 3 also was tested in April and found with highest concentrations of the chemical, with 20 parts per billion. The water from the well is now running but is bypassing the city's water distribution system and going straight to waste. The process appears to be removing larger quantities of perchlorate in the system as a whole."As we started doing that, the traces of perchlorate have come way down," Szakacs added. "Today the well is showing 12 parts per billion."The water towers are showing 0.95 parts per billion. Well 13a is hovering at 1.4 parts per billion, and it's unknown how long it will take before there are no traces left."If we can't pump that well we're not generating any revenue," Szakacs said. "We sell an average of between 7 million and 10 million gallons to Ice Mountain. They had only pumped 249,000 gallons from the time they began using the well to the time the perchlorate was detected. They still used Well 7 and they have another resource in Osceola Township called White Pines."Production at the Stanwood bottling facility has "remained consistent and strong throughout the year," Muchmore said, noting there is no danger to the number of jobs at the plant due to the presence of perchlorate in Evart."I credit that to the diversity and multiple sources for spring water Nestle has," she added. "Diversity of sources is also important to something else the company is dedicated to, which is managing resources carefully and wisely for sustainability."My understanding is the revenues to the city have remained fairly consistent this year so far," she continued. "Fortunately, we're at the end of the peak season, with spring and summer being the peak for bottled water."Fox, based at the Stanwood facility, confirmed the company purchased about the same amount of water from Evart as last year. More water was taken from the still-operational well, but it is still within permitted levels, he said.The city is not in danger of losing large amounts of money at this time, but the lack of revenue could become an issue if the well is not used for a long period of time, according to Szakacs."It depends on how long they don't pump from that well and it depends on the year," Szakacs said. "If it's really hot in the summer, they sell a lot of water and we sell a lot of water. It fluctuates and it's hard to tell. I'm not worried yet. Today our traces are way lower than Massachusetts and California. There is no health risk."I drink it. It's safe, it's clean. Drink the water."Pioneer Staff Writer Karin Armbruster also contributed to this article

Shanna AveryCaptionCloseEditor's note: This is part one of a three-part series examining the contamination of the Wash King Laundry Superfund site near Baldwin. The first article will look at the history of the site, the second article will draw attention to the current status of the site and recent PFAS contamination detected and the third article will explore future remedial actions. BALDWIN — A laundry facility once responsible for cleaning the clothes of Baldwin area people is also responsible for polluting Baldwin area groundwater.For nearly five decades, contamination issues at the Wash King Superfund site have kept township, state and federal officials busy, with no end in sight.The Wash King site is comprised of 150 acres of land and is located in Pleasant Plains Township, approximately three miles south of Baldwin on M-37. It is about 1,350 feet south of the Middle Branch of the Pere Marquette River. The parcels on the Wash King site are currently vacant and underdeveloped.The now vacant site encompassed the former Wash King Laundry coin-operated facility (1962-1991) and four lagoons, located approximately 500 feet west of the former building which were used to discharge wastes. The wastes were directed to the lagoons from a water storage tank located beneath the laundromat through underground piping, which was later determined to have leaks.Since 1982, the contaminated area became a Superfund site and was put on a National Priorities List, authorizing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to respond to laundry waste contaminants which seeped into groundwater and soil. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources took this as a lead project. Superfund sites are nationally-designated environmental cleanups which are extremely expensive and complex.Over the past four decades, investigations identified groundwater and soil contamination as primarily the dry-cleaning agent perchloroethylene (PCE) as well as other chemicals. The PCE levels, of up to 1,100 ug/kg (mass of chemical in milligrams per mass of soil in kilograms) near the Wash King building, were greatly in excess of state cleanup standards (100 ug/kg).Recently, PFAS (perfluoroalkyl substances) also were detected.BUSINESS OWNER IN CONFLICT WITH STATEIn 1962, Glen Brott, owner of Wash King Laundry, was granted permission by Michigan Water Resources Commission to discharge laundry wastes to nearby seepage lagoons constructed for this purpose. At the time, the area around the laundry was underdeveloped.During the remainder of the '60s and '70s, the area experienced increasing development and seasonal homes were constructed. Due to a lack of a municipal water system, homes and businesses near the area sank private wells.In January 1970, Wash King Laundry was purchased by Ben Bimba. Contaminants were originally discovered in 1973 through state sampling of residential drinking wells in the area. Detergent-related chemicals were found in nearby private water wells.In 1976, after further contamination of groundwater was discovered, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources forced Bimba to discontinue discharging laundry wastes to the lagoons and to develop a new disposal site. Bimba obtained a stay order and installed three observation wells to help select a suitable location for a new lagoon site, but the application was declined based on a potential new lagoon contaminating another part of the aquifer. Wastewater from the laundry continued to be discharged to the original lagoons.In September 1977, PCE up to 6,000 ppb (parts per billion) was detected in the Wash King well, and up to 20,000 ppb in the nearby Windjammer Restaurant well, directly north of the laundromat. In 1978, the state brought a suit against Wash King Laundry, and Bimba agreed to cease all dry cleaning operations and eliminate all present and past sources of PCE at the facility.PROBLEMS REMAIN However, despite the agreement, chemicals remained in the water and soil.In August 1982, PCE was found in concentrations ranging from 21 to 579 ppb (parts per billion) in 14 private wells near the lagoons and laundry — high above the no-adverse health response level. Low levels of dichlorethylene (DCE) and trichioloethylene (TCE) products related to PCE also were detected.In addition to PCE, TCE and DCE, chemical analysis of groundwater indicated low detection of boron, sodium, potassium chloride, boron tetcrachloride and methylene-blue active substances, typical of laundry wastes, as well as carbon disulfate and chloroform, which were suspected to be related to solvent/degreasers. Lead, arsenic and pesticides also have been detected at the site.Officials were concerned about health impacts of the chemicals, with PCE exposure being the greatest concern. Additional lifetime cancer risk of 1 in 100,000 is posed by drinking water in concentrations of 8.0 ppb, and the Wash King site historically ranged up to 20,000 ppb, recorded at Windjammer Restaurant on Sept. 28, 1977.One-hundred percent direct exposure to PCE can result in damage to the central nervous system, liver injury or anesthetic death. Exposures to high concentrations of PCE may cause skin, eye and nose irritation. Chronic exposure to TCE may produce impairment of senses and loss of coordination. DCE exposure can cause irritation of eyes and at high concentration, damage to  the central nervous system.ACTION TAKENIn 1983, the state attorney general negotiated a settlement with Bimba that he construct a municipal water supply system to serve residences and businesses in the area in order to get them off the wells in the contaminated plume. Two deep wells were developed into a deeper aquifer to supply water for the system. The system, which came into use by summer 1984, was designed to serve 24 establishments, and currently serves 18 residences and three businesses.By 1991, Wash King Laundry closed.A Record of Decision (ROD), an action plan adopted by the MDEQ (Michigan Department of Environmental Quality), which was recently renamed Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) dated March 31, 1993, specified treated water be discharged to secondary Wash King lagoons, constructed further west of the original lagoons. These lagoons were not used extensively by Wash King. Samplings indicated these lagoons were not contaminated and proved a cost-effective location for discharging treated water.Deed restrictions were implemented, restricting sale and use of the property until the site is fully cleaned up.From 1998 to 2001, a number of actions were taken to further clean up the site, including demolishing the laundromat building and the tank which stored laundry wastes. A pump and treat (P&T) system was installed in a treatment building on the east side of Oak Road, as well as a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system, which consists of SVE wells at five locations. In-situ bioremediation, which is the process of decontaminating polluted sites through the usage of microorganisms, began in January 2010.Subsequent to the ROD, the lagoon sediments were found to not pose a risk to human health, but soils and groundwater contamination near the Wash King building continued. With these findings, a decision was made to not excavate lagoon soils.IN RECENT YEARSIn a two-year process beginning in 2015, Pleasant Plains Township took on the project to remove the vacant Windjammer restaurant building from the site. Robert Sanders, the township's zoning administrator from 2012-2018, who is temporarily filling the position, said the township addressed the site as a blight issue."The old restaurant building was dilapidated and the township and county split the cost for cleanup of the property. The big initiative was to get the building down to get to contaminants underneath. Trustee Clint Jackson spearheaded the project," he said. "There were vapor intrusions which tested positive for PCE near the cement slab underneath the building. The township looked for avenues for the project, as it costs millions for the cleanup and assessment. The EPA assisted us to get funding to help with the cleanup. We worked with the MDEQ, as the state has a certain amount of funds to allocate."For a couple years we went through the court system (79th District Court) to get a judgment for a fire demo. The property owner walked away and the property went to the land bank. The county stepped in to help with the project. By removing the building, funds would be received for the DEQ to adequately remove contaminants beneath."The Baldwin Fire Department conducted a controlled burn in late summer 2017.The latest twist in the Wash King history took place beginning the summer of 2018, when the site tested positive for PFAS contamination, an issue which MDEQ officials are currently addressing.

Adam GacFORK TWP. — A group of area residents believes the Environmental Protection Agency and the state government made a mistake in approving an injection well in Fork Township. They want the agencies to reassess the permit.An existing well has been approved for use as an injection well, which means liquid byproducts from oil and natural gas extraction will be stored thousands of feet below ground.Members of the Mecosta County Water Protectors found an additional 45 wells not listed by the EPA in the area of the Smith 1-17 Class II Injection well site, bringing the total number of wells near the Fork Township operation to more than 100, according to Jeff Ostahowski, a member of the Water Protector executive board.“Because the law permits more than one well within 190 feet of the first well, we have no idea how many holes there might be on any given well. The most we know of is 15 on one well. So, there could be 109 wells, or there could be 500 – nobody knows. Putting injection wells in this county is colossally stupid,” he said.Ostahowski and the other members of the water protectors believe the process of injecting liquid into underground formations pose an inherent risk to ground water as well as potentially causing earthquakes.While injection wells can cause earthquakes, the chances of having an injection-induced earthquake in Michigan are “very, very low,” according to Rick Henderson, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Office of Oil Gas and Minerals Field Operator. The state has more than active 800 injection wells and more than 1,300 producing wells, he added.“They did pilot studies in the ‘70s where they found faults where pressure was building and injected water to cause small earthquakes before big ones happened,” he said. “We know that if you put water in a fault with built-up energy you can create an earthquake.”The topography of Michigan and the way injection wells like the Smith 1-17 are operated contribute to seismologically safer operations than injection wells in places like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, Henderson continued.“The difference with injection wells in those states where earthquakes are happening is they are injecting into basement rock, which would be the igneous rock layer in Michigan,” he said. “The basement rock layer is 15,000 feet deep in Cadillac and between 17,000 and 18,000 feet deep in the Mecosta County area. The Smith well is only going about 3,400 feet down.”In addition to the deeper injection depths, the basement rock layers in other states are formed from different materials than the porous formation the Smith well taps, which absorbs liquid into the rock.“Those formations don’t have the permeability and porosity the formations here in Michigan have,” Henderson said. “They are basically forcing liquid into the cracks in the rocks.”The risk of contaminating ground water with an injection well also is low, Henderson added.“Years ago I was part of workgroup tracking all of the contamination risks with pipes, wells everything that could cause a problem. Then we developed our secondary containment rules and those have been very successful,” he said. “Since about 1989, we haven’t had any major issues with contamination in well water.”The pressure of water in a formation generally isn’t strong enough to bring it to the surface, Henderson said.“In most wells, not all, you would have to go down 1,000 to 2000 feet before you even reach the water level,” he said.The Water Protectors have been unable to make much headway in their quest, but they are far from giving up, Ostahowski said.One of the biggest challenges in preventing the establishment of wells in a community is the inability of local governments to outlaw the injection well process. Townships are completely preempted from regulating injection wells, according to Jenn Fiedler, Knowledge Center communications director for the Michigan Townships Association.Fiedler referenced a 1994 court case called Dart Energy Corp. v. Iosco Twp., in which it was found the “defendant Iosco Township is expressly prohibited from regulating an oil and gas well that is converted to a brine injection well.”Rep. Phil Potvin, R. Cadillac, said he is going to be working with the DEQ and other members of the legislature to find a way for local residents to have more influence in what happens in the townships where they reside.“You get the federal and the state government involved and it can take a long time. In the meantime, things keep happening,” he said. “It takes too long, you get way too many hands involved and then by the time you get something done, whatever you were trying to stop has already happened… By keeping it local, we’ve got local eyes on it all the time.”

During this time, local residents will have the chance to rid themselves of household hazardous waste (HHW), or materials that, if disposed of incorrectly, can cause environmental damage by contaminating ground and surface waters."The purpose of this program is to protect our environment," Mecosta County Conservation District district administrator Charmaine Lucas said. "If products are improperly disposed of, they have the potential to negatively impact our environment."The Hazardous Waste Collection program is designed to keep hazardous wastes out of landfills, sewers and other public areas.Improper disposal of HHW can threaten human health, wildlife and plant life, according to Lucas.In cooperation with Clean Sweep, through the Michigan Water Stewardship Program, homeowners, as well as farms, green-houses, nurseries, golf courses or other end users of pesticides, mercury and other toxic and hazardous materials, can use this service.Collection site locations include:Lake County — Wenger Pavilion, Downtown Baldwin (behind Jones Ice Cream Parlor)Mecosta County — Fairgrounds, 540 West Ave., Big Rapids, MI 49307Osceola County — Road Commission North Facility, 13353 20 Mile Road, Tustin, MI 49688Some acceptable material include (not all-inclusive): Automotive products and fuels, antifreeze, brake fluid, car wax, contaminated oil, diesel fuel, fuel oil (no tanks), gasoline, kerosene, motor oil (containers must be five gallons or less in size — No drums), oil/gas mixtures, transmission fluid, paint products, artists’ paints, deck stain, preservatives, epoxies, glue/adhesives, lead-based paint, oil-based paint, paint strippers, thinners and solvents, turpentine, varnish and sealers, yard and garden products, insect repellents and many other products.For a full list of acceptable and unacceptable items to dispose of, visit tiny.cc/tebwdz.

Brandon FountainCaptionCloseBIG RAPIDS — Most people think hazardous waste is chemicals discarded by businesses and industries.However, there are many hazardous wastes located right in homes. Household products, often containing the same chemicals used in industry, become waste when they are no longer used.The potential dangers to  people, pets and the environment are why the Mecosta Conservation District holds its annual household hazardous waste collection in cooperation with the Michigan Stewardship Clean Sweep program."We want to provide a provide a safe method of disposing of these chemicals," said Charmaine Lucas, conservation district director. "If hazardous waste is disposed of incorrectly, then that has the potential to contaminate of our surface and ground waters. It's a public health hazard to humans, plants, pets and wildlife."It's definitely a safety and health concern."This year's collection is set for 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday, Oct. 8, at the Mecosta County Senior Center, located at 12954 80th Ave., in Mecosta. Participation is free, but donations are appreciated.Started in 2003, the collection has grown over the last 13 years, Lucas said, as the conservation district has spearheaded the program — not only collecting the items, but informing and educating the public about the dangers of household hazardous waste."We're  seeing much more participation among county residents," she said. "That  is the way things always go. New things start out slow and as the word gets out, they grow. It's grown by leaps and bounds over the last 13 years in the number of residents who participate."People are so grateful they have a place where they can dispose of this waste properly. We hope the program continues to grow."Items that become hazardous waste include automotive products and fuels such as antifreeze or used motor oil, paint products such as deck stain or lead-based paint, yard and garden products such as insecticides and pesticides, cleaning solvents or silver or metal polish, as well as fluorescent light bulbs, lighter fluids or nail polish and nail polish remover.These items, as well as others, are dangerous because not everyone follows the directions to use the product, properly stores the products or disposes of the products."Some products may cause severe injury or even death to children or pets who accidentally swallow them," Lucas said.To reduce the risk from these items, Lucas said people should buy only the amount of a product they will use. She also suggests consumers look for the signal words — like danger, warning and caution — to see if the products contain hazardous chemicals.Lucas said residents can learn more about the products they use by visiting the local library, contacting environmental agencies and organizations or using the internet to learn more about a particular product.This service is funded by businesses, organizations, foundations and governmental entities.For a full list of items accepted at the collection, visit mecostacd.org/hazardous-waste-collection/.For more information, contact the Mecosta Conservation District at (231) 796-0909 Ext. 3.

Dylan SavelaCaptionCloseKALEVA — An informational hearing on the impact of the recent Merit oil spill in Manistee County will be held at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday at the Big Bear Sportsman’s Club in Kaleva (8927 Puustinen Road).The hearing will provide an opportunity for land and orchard owners to ask questions about the impact of the spill on their properties. All are invited to attend.Bob Versical, of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's (MDEQ) Cadillac post, will present general information on the spill and describe the ongoing and upcoming cleanup efforts.The hearing is being sponsored by the Bear Creek Watershed Council, in partnership with the Manistee Conservation District, Portage Lake Watershed Forever, Arcadia/Pierport Watershed and the Little Manistee River Watershed Conservation Council."The Conservation District and people in watersheds groups were hearing rumors and getting questions (about the spill), but there was very limited information out there," said Jim Draze of the Bear Creek Watershed Alliance. "So, a small group of us met with the MDEQ, and Bob Versical gave us a presentation what happened and what will happen moving forward."We asked if he'd be willing to make the same presentation to the local public," he added, "and we were able to set this up, so that people would have a chance to hear the information and ask questions if they have any."In late December of 2017, the MDEQ was alerted to a release of crude oil and brine from a transport line owned by Merit Energy.The result was approximately 2,000 gallons of oil and brine being released to a wetland area on the north side of 8 Mile Road, between Poplar and Chief Road in Bear Lake Township, and approximately one-quarter mile south of Little Beaver Creek. The initial release of oil affected approximately 0.5 acres.Merit Energy and the MDEQ responded by developing a cleanup plan. Since late December, contaminated soils have been removed from the site and Merit Energy has been pumping, filtering and returning filtered and clean water to the wetland.Water quality is being monitored by the MDEQ. Merit Energy will be responsible for restoring the wetland, under MDEQ supervision.“There’s going to be some long term monitoring, absolutely,” Versical told the News Advocate in January. “Ultimately, (Merit) is obligated to restore that wetland area to its original conditions."They’re going to have to bring in organic fill material and reestablish the wetland vegetation to make sure it is consistent with the surrounding vegetation, and monitor to ensure no invasive species are introduced," he added. "The wetland restoration is going to take some time."Versical said while oil spills aren’t necessarily uncommon, this particular case was the region’s largest in 2017.“In our Cadillac district (which covers six counties), we had 27 spills last year,” he said. “Volumetrically, we’re talking anything from a couple of gallons to one like this, which is nearly 50 barrels.”

HR StaffBy Melissa DeRocheEmergency Preparedness Coordinator & Public Information Officer for the Central Michigan District Health DepartmentOSCEOLA COUNTY — The dangers of lead and lead poisoning have been in the headlines of local and national news sources for the last several months. The Flint water crisis has reminded residents of Michigan and public health professionals that lead continues to be a common, but preventable, public health problem.Lead is a toxic metal that can be found in a variety of common household products like pipes, vinyl blinds, dishware, paint and more. When lead is ingested, it interferes with the development and functioning of internal organs including the brain, kidneys, nerves and blood cells. Lead poses the biggest health threat to children under the age of 6 and pregnant women. Young children are at greatest risk of ingesting lead because they commonly put their hands and objects in their mouth.Lead can be found inside and outside your home. The most common sources of lead exposure are lead-based paint, lead-contaminated dust, soil and drinking water.Parents can reduce a child’s exposure to lead in many ways. Here are some simple things you can do to help protect your family:Get your Child Tested. Ask your child’s doctor about a lead test. Children covered by Medicaid insurance are required to be tested for lead at the ages of 1 and 2. Lead poisoning often shows no physical signs or symptoms; the only way to detect lead poisoning is through a blood test. If you suspect your child might be exposed to lead, talk to your doctor or local health department about lead testing.Practice Prevention. Lead poisoning is preventable with proper nutrition, housekeeping and hygiene. A diet high in iron, calcium and Vitamin C helps minimize lead absorption in children. Keep floors, surfaces and toys in your home clean. Always wash your child’s hands before eating and sleeping.Get your Home Tested. If you live in a home built before 1978, you may want to consider getting a lead inspection. Home test kits to detect lead paint are available at most large hardware stores. Lead pipes placed in your home prior to the 1980s have the potential to contaminate your water. To test the water in your home for lead, contact your local health department.Get the Facts. For more information, contact the MDHHS Michigan Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program at (888) 322-4453 or visit michigan.gov/lead. For additional resources visit, michigan.gov/deq/.

Michelle GravesCaptionCloseKALEVA — Many residents who live near a half acre area where an oil leak occurred in December were seeking answers on Thursday.About 50 people expressed a multitude of concerns at the Big Bear Sportsman’s Club during an informational meeting on the impact and clean up of the recent Merit Energy leak, referred to as the "Zimmerman 234 line loss."The event was sponsored by the Bear Creek Watershed Council, in partnership with the Manistee Conservation District, Portage Lake Watershed Forever, Arcadia/Pierport Watershed and the Little Manistee River Watershed Conservation Council.Bob Versical, of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality’s (MDEQ) Cadillac post, presented general information on the leak and describe the ongoing and upcoming cleanup efforts.On Dec. 19, Merit noticed gas production falling off at its facility, so the well was shut in and the flow line was pressure tested."No one can really say how long it’d been leaking," said Versical. "It’s hard to say, but we’re not seeing it in ground water at this point so probably a couple of days."The result was approximately 2,000 gallons of oil and brine being released to a wetland area on the north side of 8 Mile Road, between Poplar and Chief Road in Bear Lake Township, and approximately one-quarter mile south of Little Beaver Creek. The initial release of oil affected approximately 0.5 acres.Merit Energy and the MDEQ responded by developing a cleanup plan. Since late December, contaminated soils have been removed from the site and Merit Energy has been pumping, filtering and returning filtered and clean water to the wetland.Water quality is being monitored by the MDEQ. Merit Energy will be responsible for restoring the wetland, under MDEQ supervision."Merrit Energy is footing the bill for the whole thing," said Versical, who estimated that about $1 million has been spent already on clean up. “They have a corporate philosophy on being environmental stewards.”Versical told everyone gathered on Thursday that this stemmed from a pinhole leak and that the line itself it about 40 years old. He said when the lines were installed there was a yellow jacket lining."Through either a backhoe bucket or dragging the line across rocky ground, you’ll find where that yellow jacket’s been compromised and that’s where this pinhole leak will develop," he said. "Merit took this line out of service. They don’t want this to happen again."He said that in the spring Merit plans to purge many of its lines that run across sensitive areas such as this one."They’re gong to purge them and fill them full of fresh water and test them, pressure test them with fresh water and make sure they can hold that 1,000 or 2,000 psi," he said.Pamela Johnson, who lives about three-tenths of a mile from the affected area, was at Thursday's meeting.“I’m extremely concerned about this plume," she told Versical. "There’s lots of wetlands there, and I don’t think you’re monitoring wells close enough to that Little Beaver Creek. You’re doing fine where the spill is but you gotta go east further monitoring those wells.Versical said there are "more posts to the east of the spill site" that haven't been installed yet."If we have additional data that suggests that we gotta keep on moving out, they’re going to keep on moving out until they have that plume entirely defined,” he said.Johnson reminded him of the importance of it."This is very important; it goes to the Big Bear, it goes to the Manistee River, it goes out to Lake Michigan. You’re not doing enough with those monitoring wells to the east,” she said.After the meeting, she said that there was an odor at night in January during the clean up, and she could hear the pumps going from her home. She doesn't believe Merit did enough to notify the neighboring landowners.Don Koon lives next to the affected area and he's worried about ponds in his backyard and the wildlife that is attracted to them."I have three ponds directly behind my house that are the same level as this area that’s been affected. It’s frozen over now, but I anticipate in the spring when the ice thaws, there's going to be a sheen of oil on the pond," he said. "I’ve got dozens and dozens of species of birds that land in that pond. I’ve got turtles in that pond. It’s a major wetland area that’s directly behind my house and directly attached to this area."He's also upset that he never heard anything about the leak from Merit or any representative."I haven’t heard word one from the company that is responsible for this, and I live right next door to that area. I can throw a rock out of my backyard and hit that spot. Nobody’s ever contacted me, and that kind of bothers me," Koon explained. "These people knew this was leaking back in December. The part that bothers me the most is the homeowners that are right in that general area were never contacted by the company. … It’s disappointing to say the least. We had to find out by driving down the road and see all this equipment digging these areas up."However, Versical said the company informed the DEQ, which is the statutory requirement."If they thought there was going to be a threat to drinking water supplies they would have contacted the county health department, they would have contacted you. But all of our data says that everything is moving to the east,” he said.Drinking water was another concern for many residents. One asked if there was a place they could get their water tested and have Merit pay for it. Versical said he would pose the question to the company.“The groundwater is going to be flowing toward the Little Beaver Creek to the west. We’re going to get additional monitoring wells in there," Versical said. "As they move forward if there’s any indication that the drinking water supply might be at risk, they will sample the water for you."Merit representatives were invited to Thursday's meeting, but Versical said its corporate offices declined to have someone present. The company's headquarters is in Dallas, Texas, but a local office is located in Kaleva.

MNA StaffCaptionCloseBy ERIC FREEDMANCapital News ServiceLANSING — Eating Great Lakes fish that contain mercury may threaten your health, but the nutritional benefits may outweigh the risks, according to a new study of lake trout and lake whitefish consumption by members of Native American tribes with high rates of obesity, diabetes and other diseases.“Great Lakes fish should be considered for their nutritional importance relative to contemporary options, even when adjusting for risks of mercury toxicity,” according to the researchers from the Chippewa Ottawa Resource Authority’s Inter-Tribal Fisheries and Assessment Program in Sault Ste. Marie and the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.The findings come from the assessment program’s 25 years of studies of whitefish and lake trout from lakes Huron, Superior and Michigan. Authority members come from five Ottawa and Ojibwa tribes — known collectively as the Anishinaabe — in the Upper Peninsula and Northern Lower Peninsula and represent fisheries’ interests.Mercury in Great Lakes fish comes from emissions from coal-fired power plants and mining, as well as natural and other sources. Reduction of emissions often conflicts with industry interests, the study said.Human exposure to methylmercury comes most often from eating fish and shellfish with high levels of the neurotoxin in their tissues, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Symptoms include loss of peripheral vision, poor movement coordination, muscle weakness and impaired speech and hearing.Evidence from medical studies show that eating more fish containing PUFA-3 — a polyunsaturated fatty acid — can reduce the chances of type-2 diabetes and obesity.However, members of the Anishinaabe eat only one-third of the recommended daily amount of fish “despite their heritage as a fishing culture” and proximity to the Great Lakes, according to the study. They also face higher rates of cancer, heart disease, obesity and diabetes than local nonnative people.“Previous health workers in the region have examined diets of tribal members who have abandoned their traditional diets and found disturbingly high levels of obesity, diabetes and heart disease,” the study said.“The dynamic assessment of benefits and risks demonstrates the importance of traditionally caught fish on tribal health. Both species caught by tribal fishermen showed clear benefits to cardiovascular health and infant neurodevelopment if consumed at a rate of six ounces per week.”By comparison, researchers elsewhere have found “only marginal benefit or net negative effects on cardiovascular health and infant neurodevelopment” from other popular species such as tuna, tilapia and cod.“Even if they are only consuming fish at a casual sportfishing rate, it’s still culturally important to them,” said study coauthor Matthew Dellinger, a Medical College of Wisconsin epidemiologist.As the study noted, fish consumption isn’t a question of nutrition alone: “Fish are more than just a healthy food source for the Anishinaabe. They depend on wildlife, fish and plants for 'religious, ceremonial, medicinal, subsistence and economic needs.'”Balancing health risks isn’t solely a scientific calculation due to individual and cultural factors.As Dellinger put it, “On the one hand, you have general risk aversion to any kind of chemical contaminant in the food, you have historically high levels of certain contaminants and you have whatever your personal level of risk aversion may be.”Even the science is imprecise, he said, “No one knows exactly how safe or unsafe any particular fish is.”Meanwhile, initiatives are underway to communicate the study’s data to the public and to educate tribal members.“We’re steering them to fish with lower contaminants. People don’t want a long list of what they can’t do — they want short list of what they can do,” said study co-author Michael Ripley.Ripley, an environmental scientist in the Inter-Tribal Fisheries and Assessment Program, said necessary information also includes how to prepare and cook fish to reduce exposure to mercury, such as removing fat and skin from fillets.Meanwhile, testing of lake trout and lake whitefish also continues on a three-year cycle — rotating annually among lakes Michigan, Huron and Superior.The Chippewa Ottawa Resource Authority’s current and future research efforts include other species as well, Ripley said. Among them are raising walleye in the Hessel area to stock the treaty area of the lakes and to sell, collecting of perch, lake herring and rainbow smelt, and development of a computer app to calculate risk.The study includes a cautionary note because mercury isn’t the only health concern: Some Great Lakes fish may be too contaminated with pesticides, flame retardants and PCBs  — or polychlorinated biphenyls — to eat six ounces or more each week.PCBs have been linked to possible liver damage, respiratory problems and other negative health effects, while dioxins have been linked to skin disease, liver damage and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Jennifer Gray, a Michigan Department of Health and Human Services toxicologist, said, “Great Lakes fish include other organics. It’s not just methylmercury, but also dioxins and PCBs.”The department is developing different Eat Safe Fish guides about consumption risks based on the fact that different people eat different amounts.For example, frequent consumers of Great Lakes fish may want more detailed advisories and information than visitors to the state who eat only an occasional fish meal, Gray said.The study appeared in the journal “Human and Ecological Risk Assessment.”

Shanna AveryBALDWIN — During the village of Baldwin council meeting on Monday, Village President Jim Truxton gave an update on the contaminated well, saying it is still off-line and not operating until further testing can be completed.Last week, Truxton announced to village residents that recent Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) test results showed 10 parts per trillion of man-made chemicals per- and polyfluoroarkyl (PFOA and PFOS) were found in one of four wells in the village's water supply."Ten parts of a trillium of a Teflon derivative is very small. Not to make light of it, but there are no known health risks at that level," Truxton said.Truxton said the detected contaminants in the well in question could possibly be from plumbers tape or pipe dough (both materials containing Teflon) on the wellhead which was recently rehabbed."I personally drink and cook with the village water every day. I think bottled water is a waste of time," he said. "We will have the well tested this week, and will send the sample to a different lab to crosscheck the results. Being Teflon doesn't stick to anything, the contaminants could be difficult to filter out. It will be interesting to see if the contaminants were found in some place very specific and not in the groundwater itself.Truxton said the village is taking every precaution to make sure the matter is properly taken care of.

He did not enter pleas.The judge continued the case to Sept. 18.“I will aggressively defend my client against these charges in court,” Riccio said later as he left the Golden Hill Street courthouse with Michelangelo.Michelangelo, who has served as the town’s public works director since 2012, is accused of conspiring with Scott Bartlett, the town’s superintendent of public works and Jason Julian, co-owner of Julian Enterprises to allow Julian’s company to dump truck loads of toxic waste onto property adjacent to the town’s public works garage.Bartlett and Julian are charged with multiple counts of first-degree larceny, first-degree forgery, second-degree forgery, conspiracy, paying and receiving kickbacks and illegal dumping charges. They were arraigned Wednesday.A legal defense fund has been set up for Bartlett with more than $18,000 raised so far. The cleanup of that site has cost Fairfield taxpayers more than $779,000, and that figure is expected to go higher as more dumping locations are discovered, according to court documents.The court documents state that Bartlett, who was in financial straits, agreed to allow Julian to dump the material at the site in exchange for monetary kickbacks and giving Bartlett’s son a job.“Joe Michelangelo…was aware of this dumping of the prohibited construction and demolition debris and allowed it to occur to the detriment of the town of Fairfield,” the arrest warrant application states. “As a result of this detailed criminal activity, the town of Fairfield has been left with tons of potentially contaminated and polluted material to be removed and/or managed at the expense of Fairfield taxpayers.”The documents state that police believe Julian Enterprises resold some of the soil that was loaded with lead and PCBs as clean fill for construction projects in Fairfield. On Wednesday the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection dug up area of Gould Manor Park in Fairfield to check for the presence of the toxins.The contaminated soil came from Julian’s project to demolish the former Connecticut Limousine property on Commerce Drive and from material dredged from Ash Creek, the documents state.

By Frank JulianoBRIDGEPORT — Cecil Young, a longtime community activist who was fired from his job at the city Health Department 10 years ago, took his protest to the streets Tuesday, as a few bemused businesspeople passed by on their way to lunch.Young maintains that he was fired because he was a whistle blower, publicizing the existence of a pile of contaminated dirt at the health department. He used a whistle — because he’s a “whistle blower’’ — and a microphone and portable speakers to get his message out.He had set up on the sidewalk in front of the former RBS building at 1000 Lafayette Boulevard because the FBI has its area office in the building, and the FBI has several complaints from Young over the contaminated dirt and his firing.CaptionCloseBut the federal agency is not the only target of his ire. Young said he has raised the matter with state and local officials too, including Mayor Joe Ganim, state Sen. Ed Gomes and former state Sen. Ernest Newton and several City Council members over the years, all to no avail.“I’m getting old and tired,’’ Young said during his sidewalk protest. “But that dirt pile is still there and kids are still playing in it and risking cancer. Nobody wants to do anything about it.“Where’s my justice?’’ he yelled into his microphone. “I’m not going to vote anymore. These anti-poverty pimps are using our people and our neighborhoods, but they don’t want to do anything.“They say ‘if you see something, say something,’ but I did that and I got fired,’’ Young said to a reporter. Three Bridgeport police officers pulled up to the curb, and when they saw that Young had a valid permit for his protest they left.City officials said in March 2006 that Young was fired because of too many unexcused absences.He filed a state court suit against the city and a complaint with then-state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal under Connecticut’s whistle blower law. Young also filed complaints with the state Board of Mediation and Arbitration and state auditors. That complaint was over dental coverage Young said was denied to himself and his family after he was fired.

By Bethany BumpCapital RegionMore Capital Region school districts received water test results over the past two weeks showing elevated lead levels in their water fountains, sinks, showers and other places, according to notices published on district websites.At one Rensselaer County district, lead levels were as high as 198 parts per billion — more than 13 times the acceptable limit.Results will continue to pour in this year as schools across the state work to comply with a new state law requiring the testing. The Times Union is posting results daily on its Schools Blog, http://blog.timesunion.com/schools/.The new law requires all public schools in New York to test water for lead at any outlet that is currently or potentially used for drinking or cooking. If a source shows lead levels above 15 parts per billion, a district is required to shut it off, and develop and implement a remediation plan — whether that be replacing pipes, faucets and other parts, or making bottled water available to students.The latest districts to post results include Albany, Averill Park, Cohoes, Hoosic Valley, Hoosick Falls, Lansingburgh, North Colonie, Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk, Rensselaer, Saratoga Springs, Schodack, Shenendehowa, South Glens Falls, Troy and Watervliet.Most contaminated water came from classroom and bathroom sinks meant for hand washing or lab experiments. The following schools, however, had contaminated drinking or cooking water:Albany, Giffen Memorial Elementary: room 100 drinking fountain (35.1 ppb), room 102 drinking fountain (27.7 ppb), first-floor hallway drinking fountain near room 102 (16.6 ppb), room 104 drinking fountain (16.2 ppb)Albany, Thomas O'Brien Academy of Science and Technology: room 101 drinking fountain (27.8 ppb), room 105 drinking fountain (23.8 ppb) Averill Park, Poestenkill Elementary: room 17 (art room) water fountain (15.7 ppb)Hoosic Valley Elementary School: room 61 faculty room bubbler (56.3 ppb)Hoosick Falls Elementary School: computer lab drinking fountain (17.5 ppb)Lansingburgh, Rensselaer Park Elementary: cafeteria water fountain (46 ppb), room 220 water fountain (24 ppb). room 230 water fountain (23 ppb)Lansingburgh, Turnpike Elementary: room 220 water fountain (21 ppb), room 223 water fountain (21 ppb), room 230 water fountain (17 ppb), room 227 water fountain (17 ppb) North Colonie, Southgate Elementary: room 28 bubbler (120 ppb)Shenendehowa, Karigon Elementary: room 25 drinking fountain (24 ppb), room 3 drinking fountain (17 ppb), room 15 drinking fountain (17 ppb), room 18 drinking fountain (16 ppb), room 11 drinking fountain (16 ppb)Shenendehowa, Skano Elementary: room 20 drinking fountain (23 ppb), room 1 drinking fountain (17 ppb), room 14 drinking fountain (16 ppb)Saratoga Springs, Caroline Street Elementary: hallway drinking fountain near main office (17.1 ppb)South Glens Falls, Moreau Elementary School: music room 9 sink fountain (39.4 ppb), room 22 sink fountain (22.2 ppb), room 15 sink fountain (17 ppb), room 21 sink fountain (16.8 ppb), room 17 sink fountain (16.3 ppb), kitchen kettle (15.9 ppb)South Glens Falls High School: kitchen square kettle (49.1 ppb)Troy Middle School: auditorium vestibule water fountain (22 ppb)New York became the first state in the nation to require comprehensive water testing in schools when the law was passed on Sept. 6. Districts had until Sept. 30 to test elementary schools, and must post the results within 10 days of receiving them. They had until Oct. 31 to test all other schools.Lead exposure is particularly harmful to young children, even at low levels. Prolonged exposure can result in lower IQ, behavioral problems and brain damage. The toxic material enters drinking water when pipes containing lead corrode, especially if the water running through them has high acidity or low mineral content. Human skin does not absorb lead in water, so sinks that are used for washing are not cause for worry.bbump@timesunion.com • 518-454-5387 • @bethanybump

By Bill CummingsCaptionCloseHARTFORD -- President Barack Obama's sweeping plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing electric plants could pull the plug on Bridgeport's controversial coal-burning facility.Obama last week announced plans to bypass Congress and issue executive orders to reduce national carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020, in part by limiting the amount of carbon released from plants like Bridgeport Harbor Station.The Bridgeport plant has long been a target of activists who want the facility shut down, saying it needlessly adds to global warming and climate change, while spewing dangerous toxins into the air."This is the game changer we have been waiting for," said Onte Johnson, organizer of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign."This coal plant will not be around much longer, and this will facilitate that," Johnson said. "The president's plan is a strong step forward in our fight to protect our planet and our families from a climate crisis."Although the details of Obama's proposed climate change initiative is not yet known, activists are betting the cost of meeting new emission standards will outweigh the economic benefit of continuing to operate coal-burning facilities like Bridgeport Harbor Station.Michael Jennings, a spokesman for the Public Service Enterprise Group, which owns the Bridgeport plant, said it's too early to comment on how Obama's initiative will affect it.Jennings said PSEG agrees with a statement generally supporting the initiative released by the Clean Energy Group, which represents the utility industry."We view the president's renewed focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions as an important step," said Michael Bradley, CEG executive director. "As our member companies' experience demonstrates, greenhouse gas reductions can be achieved cost effectively." State officials and environmentalists said Obama's initiative is a big step in the right direction."President Obama has courageously charted an aggressive and innovative course to address one of the most challenging and pressing issues of our time," said Gov. Dannel P. Malloy."While it is fashionable in some circles to deride climate change, scientific evidence speaks clearly to the fact that temperatures are warming, sea levels are rising and storms are growing more frequent and severe, all at a time when carbon emissions from human activity on our planet continue to reach new record highs," Malloy said.In Connecticut, only the Bridgeport plant, which operates during peak power demand, uses coal to produce electricity. It provides power for more than 500,000 homes from Bridgeport to Greenwich.Several other Connecticut electric plants, including one at the Bridgeport Harbor Station, burn natural gas, and the Millstone Power Station in Waterford is nuclear.The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People last year ranked the Bridgeport coal-burning plant as the 10th worst in the nation for carbon emissions and polluting the surrounding neighborhood.The NAACP report said pollutants emitted by coal plants have been linked to asthma attacks, lung inflammation, chronic bronchitis, irregular heart conditions and birth defects. According to the Clean Air Task Force, coal pollution is estimated to cause 13,200 premature deaths and 9,700 hospitalizations per year across the United States."It's definitely a positive, and we are totally in tune with that direction," said Dennis Schain, a spokesman for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection,  referring to Obama's climate control initiative."We have had a big focus on reducing emissions at power plants and we are doing that with participating states in a cap and trade program. The state's energy strategy increases efficiency and using renewables like solar, wind and fuel cells. We thought (Obama's plan) was a big step forward for the nation. We are doing a lot of it already," Schain said.Connecticut is using incentives to encourage businesses and homeowners to switch from oil to cleaner-burning natural gas."This is the change we have been waiting for on climate," said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune.Still, the Associated Press reported last week that congressional Republicans dismissed the climate initiative as a "war on coal" and jobs.

By Julia PerkinsBROOKFIELD — The town plans to test properties on Laurel Hill and Station roads for possible chemical contamination from a former dry cleaners nearby.The chemicals could have spread from 20 Station Road, an old dry cleaners where investigators found it would be impossible to clean up the contaminates that seeped into the bedrock.First Selectman Steve Dunn told the Board of Selectmen this week that the town now wants to test nearby homes on Station Road and northwest to Laurel Hill Road. He said town officials planned to contact property owners beginning Tuesday.“We’re not going to do the remediation for them, but at least we can do the testing,” Dunn said.The plan is to pay for the testing using money left over from a $145,000 grant from the state to examine the extent of the contamination at 20 Station Road.“The state was pretty good about letting us extend the applicability of that grant,” Dunn said.Meanwhile, the selectmen voted to apply for a $275,000 grant from the state Department of Economic and Community Development to help figure out what could be done with the property.The money could pay for the demolition of the building and enable the property to be redeveloped, according to the town’s application.Dunn said the building could potentially be rehabilitated, but that it might not be worth it.“It’s in pretty bad shape,” he said.Dunn said he would prefer the building be torn down. He has previously said a parking lot could be perfect there, because it is near where the town has installed streetscape for its downtown revitalization project.In its application to the state, the town said the developer who plans to build The Enclave, a 181-unit affordable housing and mixed-use complex, is interested in the property.The developer could use the land for a “complimentary project” to The Enclave, but is concerned about the soil and groundwater contamination, the town said in its application. This project could include public parking for the retail spaces in The Enclave.“The revitalization of the Town Center District relies on investors such as this interested developer to create the necessary housing and commercial space to ignite the potential for the area’s vitality and success,” town officials stated in the application, which also notes 10 to 20 jobs could be created to manage the apartments or the parking lot.

By Susan TuzCaptionCloseThe unprecedented blue-green algae bloom in Candlewood Lake last October may be a sign of things to come. Or worse.In its poisonous wake, an environmental consultant was hired by the five towns surrounding the lake -- Danbury, New Milford, Brookfield, New Fairfield and Sherman -- to study the lake's water quality."The most serious cause (of the algae bloom) is coming from the lack of oxygen in the lake's deep center," said Mark June-Wells of New England Environmental, Inc.Runoff from the watershed into the lake sends nitrogen, phosphorous, salt and other pollutants -- called nutrients in this context -- spilling into the water, polluting its quality.The depletion of oxygen in the deep center of the lake causes massive phosphorous releases from the lake bed soil, June-Wells said.He said controlling these phosphorus releases would be "a massive undertaking" and would be cost prohibitive."We're always concerned about the (lake's) water quality," said Larry Marsicano, executive director of the Candlewood Lake Authority. "Fortunately, Candlewood has an amazing resiliency, given the development of its watershed. But that resiliency won't last forever. We have to get a handle on the nutrients coming from the watershed."We've talked about sewering sections of the lake perimeter, but that would not be cheap," Marsicano said. "In the worst-case scenario, algae blooms would be more frequent, forcing the beaches on the lake to be closed. Blue-green algae also produces toxins."Either way, a practical solution seems elusive at this point."It would require the cooperation of the five towns, the CLA, and FirstLight utility company, (the lake's owner)," June-Wells said.There are two ways to manage these phosphorous releases, he said. An alum treatment could be done with aluminum sulfate released in the water, which would inactivate the phosphorous by capping the soils.Or, a mixing treatment could be done through aeration or by installing a circulation system.With aeration, air is injected directly into the bottom of the lake. With a circulation system, a current is created in the water, June-Wells said.His six-month study of the lake confirmed what a CLA study had previously found. The CLA study analyzed water quality data gathered by the CLA from 1985 to 2012 to determine if there was an outstanding trend. By and large, Marsicano said, they couldn't find one."Starting in the 1950s, water quality in the lake started to decline," Marsicano said. "As the watershed became more highly developed, the decline in water quality continued into late 1970s and early 1980s."Then research started on issues surrounding Candlewood and since the early 1980s, what we've seen is fluctuation in the water quality."Three of the five towns on the lake -- New Milford, Brookfield and New Fairfield -- have taken action to reduce nutrient pollution by adding requirements to their zoning regulations that call for site planning.The mayors and first selectmen of the five towns on the lake plan to meet with the CLA to discuss what to do next, Marsicano said.No date for that meeting has been set.stuz@newstimes.com; 860-355-7322

By Jim Shay By Jim ShayA chemical spill in Southington has prompted the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to tell people not to eat fish in a stretch of the Quinnipiac River until water quality results are known.DEEP said the tests are needed to assess the impact of the release of a chemical substance Wednesday from a plant near the river in that town.“We recommend that people not eat any fish taken from the Quinnipiac between West Queen Street and downstream to Route 10 - South Main St. - in Southington until we have an opportunity to determine the extent of any lingering contamination in the river resulting from a chemical release yesterday,” said DEEP Deputy Commissioner Susan Whalen. The Rt. 10 - South Main Street - portion of the river is downstream from where the Eight Mile River flows into the Quinnipiac and adds a significant volume of new water to it. Deputy Commissioner Whalen said, “Water and soil sediment samples are being taken from the Quinnipiac today and we expect to have results to look at tomorrow. This will allow us to assess the effect of the chemical release on aquatic life in those waters.”Regulations governing fishing designate the Quinnipiac River, as it flows through Southington, as a Wild Trout Management Area, where any trout caught by anglers must be released. It is possible, however, to catch other species of fish in those waters - which anglers are allowed to take. Late Wednesday morning a release of hexavalent chromium was reported at Light Metals Coloring, 270 Spring Street, Southington. The release is estimated at about 300 gallons. DEEP is advising the public to stay away from the banks of the Quinnipiac River in this immediate area, because of the potential for contact with hexavalent chromium in the soils there. Hexavalent chromium is linked to long term adverse health impacts - and skin irritations can be an immediate effect of contact with it.Hexavalent chromium is a salt-like substance - associated with public health impacts - that is mixed with liquids as part of the manufacturing process at Light Metals. A malfunction in the system there led to liquid containing the chemical to be released through roof vents. It then drained off the roof and through roof drains, onto a road surface, a driveway, and soils - and also into a catch basin system which carried some of it out to the nearby Quinnipiac River.DEEP Emergency Response personnel responded to the scene and remain there Thursday By Jim Shayto supervise cleanup efforts of an environmental cleanup contractor hired by the company. Road and driveway surfaces as well as soils that were potentially exposed to the hexavalent chromium are being excavated and taken away for proper disposal. The storm drain system is also being cleaned and inspected to make certain waters flowing through it do not carry more of the chemical into the Quinnipiac River. Sampling to help determine potentially contaminated areas is also being conducted in the waters of the Quinnipiac and along its shores.DEEP says the town of Southington has stopped using water from two wells that are part of its public drinking water system until tests results verify that they are unaffected by the release. One of the wells is about 1.5 miles from the release area and the other is about five miles away, but this action was taken as a precaution to make certain the water quality from them was not impacted by the release.

The lawsuit does not make a claim for any bodily injuries, although the state Health Department is examining concerns by village residents that their community has been afflicted with a high rate of cancer and other illnesses. PFOA exposure has been linked to increased health effects, including testicular and kidney cancer and thyroid disease.The complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Albany also does not say whether any of the plaintiffs — Michele Baker; Angela Corbett; Michelle O'Leary and Daniel Shuttig — are afflicted with any health problems from drinking contaminated water. The claim states that Baker tried to refinance the mortgage on her Mahar Road home in January but was turned down by a local bank because of the water pollution.Corbett, the lawsuit states, has a private well but is concerned she will not be able to sell her home. O'Leary, who moved to Hoosick Falls last September, has two children and fears for their health, the claim states. Her home gets water from the village's public supply, which draws water from underground wells near the Saint-Gobain plant.O'Leary helped organize a grassroots organization that has been delivering bottled water to elderly and other residents who cannot get it on their own from a local supermarket. Schuttig also owns a home that gets water from the village's treatment plant and is concerned about his property value, the complaint states.The lawsuit was filed by attorneys for Weitz & Luxenberg, a firm that specializes in class-action and personal injury litigation. It seeks class-action status for any residents or property owners damaged as a result of the pollution, including those with private wells. The filing lists claims for negligence, private nuisance, trespassing and liability for abnormally dangerous activity. Even if the firm is successful in establishing the class-action status, it would not prohibit others in the village from filing claims for any health-related illnesses.The law firm began aggressively pursuing the case two months ago, around the time a Times Union story revealed state Health Department and village officials were still telling residents the water was safe to drink despite contrary warnings from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The village subsequently shifted its position, warning residents to stop consuming the water."While Saint-Gobain has acted quickly and openly since learning of the presence of PFOA in the drinking water supply in the village of Hoosick Falls, we respect the right of individuals to pursue their claims in a court of law," said Dina Silver Pokedoff, a company spokeswoman. "Saint-Gobain has, and will continue to work with the local, state and federal agencies to investigate the source of the PFOA in the drinking water."Honeywell officials recently met with state agencies to discuss the situation."Honeywell is doing a review to understand the historic operations by our predecessor, AlliedSignal Laminated Systems Inc., which operated in Hoosick Falls between 1986 and 1996," said Victoria Ann Streitfeld, Honeywell's spokeswoman. "After selling the business in 1996, AlliedSignal Laminated Systems conducted several site investigations and received 'No Further Action' letters from the New York state Department of Environmental Conservation. Regulations did not require testing for PFOA at the time."Streitfeld said Honeywell has offered to help with the ongoing testing of private wells in the village of Hoosick Falls and town of Hoosick.On Jan. 30, Weitz & Luxenberg organized a public meeting at Bennington College in Vermont, just across the border from Hoosick Falls, that was attended by dozens of people. The event was bolstered by the firm's high-profile consultant, environmental advocate Erin Brockovich, who is widely known for her efforts in an environmental pollution case against Pacific Gas & Electric in California.PFOA, a man-made chemical, was discovered in Hoosick Falls' water system by a village resident, Michael Hickey, who began researching the issue two years ago. Hickey said his interest was piqued by what he believed was a high rate of cancer in the village. His father, John, who worked at the Saint-Gobain plant for decades, died of kidney cancer in 2013. Hickey used his own money to have samples of village water tested for PFOA and he notified village officials in 2014 that the tests showed the levels of the chemical found in the system exceeded federal health advisories. PFOA has been used since the 1940s to make products such as nonstick coatings and heat-resistant wiring.Last month, the state Department of Environmental Conservation called on Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics and Honeywell International to enter consent orders that would require them to clean up the remnants of the toxic chemical that polluted water supplies in and around the village of Hoosick Falls.The DEC said in a statement that its preliminary investigation, begun last month, determined the two corporations, and possibly others, are the "parties responsible" for the presence of high levels of PFOA that were discovered two years ago in the village's public water supply. The chemical has since been found in private wells in and around the village, as well as in the groundwater under Saint-Gobain's McCaffrey Street plant a few hundred yards from the village's water treatment plant. Saint-Gobain has owned the McCaffrey Street plant since 1999. Honeywell's predecessor corporation, Allied Signal, operated the facility from 1986 to 1996, one of five companies that owned and operated the site since 1956.The lawsuit provides a detailed outline of the history of the McCaffrey Street site, including practices that included washing PFOA-contaminated residue into floor drains during the manufacturing processes. "Those floor drains resulted in the discharge of PFOA into the soil and, in turn, into the aquifer," the lawsuit states.Although the federal complaint said Saint-Gobain halted the use of PFOA at the plant in 2004, the company has said it did not eliminate its use of PFOA at the facility until 2014. A company spokeswoman previously told that Times Union that, for the production of films and tapes, it used "lower, steadily decreasing levels of PFOA" from 2006 to 2014.In addition to punitive damages, the federal lawsuit seeks "consequential damages" that would pay for a medical monitoring program in which people exposed to PFOA would be regularly tested for any adverse health effects.A spokeswoman for Saint-Gobain last month said the company was "potentially" responsible for the pollution and that there has been no official determination about the cause of the contamination, which state officials acknowledged may have come from multiple manufacturing facilities in and around the village.Saint-Gobain, which said it learned of the pollution in December 2014, has voluntarily funded the distribution of bottled water and said it will pay for the installation of a temporary water filtration system as well as a long-term water filtration system expected to be in place by October.DEC said the agency will use its Superfund authority to make sure the contamination is cleaned up.The DEC released a map last month identifying 11 current and former manufacturing sites in Hoosick Falls where it said PFOA chemicals may have been used in processing. The sites are John Street, McCaffrey Street, Carey Avenue, Church Street, three locations on River Road, Liberty Street, First Street and two locations on Mechanic Street.blyons@timesunion.com • 518-454-5547 • @brendan_lyonstu

By Tim O'BrienClifton ParkHundreds of gallons of untreated sewage leaked into the Stony Creek, which leads to the backup water source for the town of Colonie.Although legally a potential source of drinking water, the Stony Creek Reservoir is not used for that purpose.Grease build-up in a pipe lead to the leak at 8 a.m. Thursday, said Clifton Park Supervisor Phil Barrett.The problem was fixed by 9:30 a.m., he said.Though the reservoir is in Clifton Park, it is owned by Colonie. The two towns once talked about a possible sale but could not come to terms.The leaked matter went into the storm water system but that water flows through two ponds and the creek before reaching the reservoir."We identified what the issue was and where it started from," Barrett said. "We were able to identify the issue and correct it quickly."Sara Wiest, a spokeswoman for the town, said the drinking supply was not contaminated."Stony Creek Reservoir is not used for drinking water for anyone," she said. "It's simply used as backup for Colonie in the unlikely event something happened to our water source."

That’s according to the American Lung Association “State of the Air 2019” report released Wednesday, April 24,When it comes to clean air, all eight Connecticut counties get an F for ozone pollution.In a report released Wednesday by the American Lung Association — “State of the Air 2019” — researchers ranked metropolitan areas based on ozone and particle pollution in 2015, 2016 and 2017.The 20th annual air quality report card tracks Americans’ exposure to unhealthful levels of ozone and particle pollution, both of which can be deadly.Connecticut’s worst air pollution ranking comes from ozone. The state is ranked 10th as the worst polluted with ozone. The ranking includes New York-Newark, N.J. and Pennsylvania.Often called smog, ozone pollution is harmful to breathe. Ozone aggressively attacks lung tissue by reacting chemically with it. When ozone is present, other harmful pollutants can be created.The methodology of the report determined a “weighted average” of ozone pollution based on the number of “orange” and “red” days.Orange days are when the air quality index is between 101 and 150, on days when temperatures are in the 80s and 90s and winds are light. Red days are when air quality index is between 151 and 200, on days that are hot, hazy and humid, the air is stagnant and skies are sunny with little chance of precipitation.Fairfield County had the highest number of high ozone days with an average of 25.8 days. It had 52 orange days and 17 red days.New Haven County was second with 15.7 days. It had 32 orange days and 10 red days.Middlesex County was third with 11.5 days. It had 30 orange days and three red days.New London County had an average of 10.7 days. It had 26 orange days and 4 red days.Hartford County was fifth with 6.2 days. It had 17 orange days and one red day.Litchfield County has a weighted average of 6.2 days. It had 13 orange days and one red day.Tolland County average was 4.7 days. It had 14 orange days and no red days.Windham County had the lowest average with 3.8 days. It had 10 orange days and no red days.California had the highest ozone pollution with seven of its cities in the Top 10.Connecticut gets a passing grade with particle pollution — a mix of ash, soot, diesel exhaust, chemicals, metals and aerosols. The microscopic particles can burrow deep within the lungs, triggering asthma, heart attacks, strokes and lung cancer.Although Connecticut has some of the toughest air pollution standards in the country, officials have said Connecticut is downwind of polluting power plants in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia that have failed to provide ozone-reduction plans.Connecticut joined New York and six other Northeastern states in suing the EPA over the enforcement of pollution from Midwestern power plants. The Trump administration has allowed nine states to exceed pollution limits.In February, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong filed the suit to force the Environmental Protection Agency to comply with federal law by requiring further controls on smog pollution.“Connecticut sits at the end of the tailpipe of the nation's exhaust fumes, with severe consequences for public health,” Tong said. “States like Connecticut ... downwind of some of our country's heaviest polluters need the protection of strong interstate ozone pollution regulation. Trump EPA’s failure to comply with the Clean Air Act violates federal law and endangers the health of Connecticut families.”

By Robert MarchantCaptionCloseGREENWICH — Investigators have found contaminants believed to have leached into the soil from Westchester County Airport in the well water of two Greenwich property owners in the north end of town.Two of eight private wells sampled in February by a testing company showed elevated levels of a chemical used in a firefighting foam at the airport, according to a notice sent Friday by Greenwich’s Director of Health Caroline Baisley. The residents were notified that they should not drink their well water.According to the town health department, seven public-water sources were checked in February, and those results came back negative. Additional testing will take place, however, as an extra precaution.High levels of perfluorooctane substances, known as PFAS, were found in the private wells, exceeding state limits.PFAS, which went out of production in 2002, were used as an ingredient in extinguishing petroleum-based fires, and the environmental regulators believe the chemical was used during training with an Air National Guard unit formerly based at Westchester County Airport. The chemical has been linked to cancer and other maladies.The discovery of toxins in residential well water was disquieting, said Allen Williams, president of the Northwest Greenwich Association. While it was something of a relief that the toxins did not turn up repeatedly, Williams said in an email, “It’s those two out of eight private homeowner wells, 25 percent, which tested above the allowable standard that still has me concerned.”Williams, said he would like more information. “We need to know the exact levels those wells tested — were they ‘slightly above,’ ‘much above’ or ‘off the charts’ above the allowable standard?” he said.The town did not release specifics on the levels of PFAS. Williams said he also did not know whether the water was safe to use for bathing and household purposes, for the affected residents.The water-contamination issue arose after the Westchester County Commissioner of Public Works announced that a test well on New King Street, not far from the Greenwich border, showed elevated levels of the chemical.An office complex on New King Street in the town of North Castle, N.Y., begin using bottled water after the announcement was made. A detection of 96 parts per trillion of a perfluorooctane chemical was found in Westchester, exceeding the federal “health advisory level” of 70 parts per trillion.Baisley said a community discussion on the issue would be planned.“Confirmation well water sampling is underway, with testing results expected in several weeks. An informational session on the overall well water testing project will be arranged in the near future for residents with private wells and community well water suppliers who have been impacted by PFAS being released into the environment,” she said.”The Greenwich Department of Health will continue to work closely with the Department of Public Health and Department of Energy and Environmental Protection on this important matter and will be available to answer questions and assist residents as needed.”rmarchant@greenwichtime.com

By BRIAN NEARING, Staff writerALBANY — The state wants to fine a Buffalo-area natural gas drilling company $187,500 for polluting a trout creek in the state's largest park. The alleged problem: runoff from roads surrounding the firm's hydrofracking wells across the border in Pennsylvania.The state Department of Environmental Conservation moved Tuesday to fine U.S. Energy, of suburban Amherst, saying the company had repeatedly fouled Yeager Creek in Allegany State Park since August 2010.The proposed fine includes a $75,000 penalty against the company for allegedly failing to fix surface drainage problems around its gas wells in Allegheny National Forest in McKean County, Pa., despite signing two agreements in 2010 and 2011 with DEC to do so.The wells use low-volume hydrofracking, and are of the less extensive vertical type, rather than horizontal, according to DEC. Hydrofracking relies on a high-pressure mix of chemicals, sand and water pumped into deep underground rock formations to free trapped natural gas. DEC is studying whether to allow the technique in the state.The proposed fines stem from what DEC views as U.S. Energy's inadequate or missing controls to prevent storms from washing mud and other materials from heavily used mining roads into the brook that flows north into New York and the park.Investigations by DEC and the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation — conducted in August 2010, November 2010, September and December 2011, and this month — found the company's roads upstream were covered in thick, heavy mud that was being washed by rain into the brook.Located about 60 miles southeast of Buffalo, the 65,000-acre park attracts more than 1.8 million visitors annually. A designated trout stream, Yeager Brook was rendered "cloudy and gray" because of the pollution, according to DEC."This enforcement action should provide a strong deterrent to other oil and gas well operators in New York and neighboring states whose operations impact New York's natural resources," said DEC Deputy Commissioner and General Counsel Steven Russo. "We will not allow U.S. Energy's actions in Pennsylvania to negatively impact New York's waters."The company denied any problems and will dispute the fine, spokesman William Albert said."The wells are in Pennsylvania and the company's operations are regulated there by the (Pennsylvania) Department of Environmental Protection. U.S. Energy is not aware of any issues at the wells in question," he said. "We were told that DEC alerted Pennsylvania's DEP of its concerns. DEP asked DEC for a meeting to discuss DEC's concerns for validation, but DEC never responded back to DEP. U.S. Energy intends to vigorously defend itself."The company signed agreements with DEC in December 2010 and August 2011 for polluting Yeager Brook, and was fined $3,500. Another $8,000 fine was imposed but would be suspended if the company fixed the issues.In July 2009, Pennsylvania environmental officials fined the company $200,000 and halted drilling at most of its wells because of hundreds of "persistent and repeated" environmental violations over the previous two years.At that time, Pennsylvania DEP Regional Director Kelly Burch said U.S. Energy showed a "pattern of behavior that displays disregard for environmental regulations and laws, the consequences being the contamination of water and soil." The state allowed U.S. Energy to resume full operation in October 2010 after correcting the violations.In 2008, U.S. Energy also sought state permission to drill five test wells in Allegany State Park on land where it claimed to control private mineral rights spread over 3,000 acres. The state rebuffed the effort, demanding that the company prove it actually held those rights. U.S. Energy and the state wrangled over legal records for more than a year before the company dropped its effort.Reach Brian Nearing at 454-5094 or bnearing@timesunion.com.

By Brian NearingCaptionCloseAlbany A new state law goes into effect Wednesday to alert the public about municipal sewage spills within hours so they can decide if it is safe to be near the water. A state Department of Environmental Conservation news release touting the law lacked a key detail — the agency hasn't put out rules that sewer operators and county health officials can follow to help them report any spills into rivers and streams. Eight months after Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the legislation, DEC has failed to put out the necessary rules for municipalities so that the information will be made public quickly."DEC is still working on the rules, and they are working with limited resources as diligently as they can. We understand that DEC is working in the real world," said John Lipscomb, water quality monitoring director of the Hudson River advocacy group Riverkeeper, who has been measuring sewage spills in the Hudson since 2006. The Ossining-based group supported the law's passage and since has been reacting to draft rules proposed by DEC. "Just because DEC has not finalized rules, we hope that sewer districts do the right thing and start reporting their spills in a timely fashion," he said.Lipscomb said he hopes the program might be ready sometime later this year. It requires DEC to see to it that spill information is available to the general public as close to possible within four hours of a spill.The lack of rules was confirmed by Rensselaer County, which has both a sewer plant and a county health department that would have to comply. "When we receive the specifics of this law, we will focus on complying with it," said Richard Crist, spokesman for the Rensselaer County Legislature majority. A spokeswoman for Albany County Executive Dan McCoy, who also oversees a sewer plant and health department, referred a reporter seeking comment about whether the county was ready for the law back to DEC.Asked about the absence of agency rules, DEC spokeswoman Emily DeSantis said, "Operators must report discharges to DEC, which DEC will put on its website. Additional requirements will be detailed in the regulations to notify the public." She gave no indication when regulations would be made final.In the news release, DEC Commissioner Joseph Martens credited the governor's support of the law that "further reinforces the administration's efforts to provide transparency while protecting residents from potentially coming into contact with polluted waters." Prior to the new law, local officials had to reveal sewage spills to certain public officials, but not the general public. The notices could come days later. Sewage treatment plants were required to inform DEC and the local health department only about spills that could harm shellfish harvesting, swimming or recreational areas. Anglers, canoeists, kayakers or swimmers might never know sewage had just been spilled upstream.Overall, the Hudson in the Capital Region was the most sewage-fouled of the river's four geographic regions, said a report issued in December by Riverkeeper. Based on water tests done beginning in 2006, about 41 percent of samples here tested as unsafe under federal standards, compared to 23 percent in the Catskill-Bear Mountain region, 22 percent in New York City, and 17 percent in Westchester and Rockland counties.Capital Region sewer plants, unlike those in New York City and elsewhere on the river, do not use disinfection methods like chlorine or ultraviolet light before treated sewage water is put into the river. A sewage plan for the Capital Region considered by the state would add seasonal disinfection to treatment plants. The plan would not address a problem plaguing the region's system: sewage overflows caused when heavy rains fill storm drains and overwhelm treatment plants, which dump a mix of water and untreated sewage into the Hudson.About 90 times each year, "combined sewer overflows" (CSOs) in the region dump about 1.2 billion gallons of untreated sewage and rainwater into the river, making it unsafe for human contact through swimming, boating and fishing. In November, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the plan was flawed and needed to be redone. The state Department of Environmental Conservation, which helped local officials develop their plan, agreed to rework it.According to Tuesday's DEC press release, the agency will put information on its website about CSO locations on a new webpage located at http://bit.ly/10qDtZLEPA is requiring the region's sewer systems to comply with federal water pollution rules under the Clean Water Act before it renews pollution permits for sewage treatment plants. Troy's permit expired in July 2011, Albany County's permit expired in December 2011, and Watervliet's permit expired in January 2012. bnearing@timesunion.com • 518-454-5094 • @Bnearing10

By Bill CummingsThe federal Environmental Protection Agency was busy this year deleting contaminated sites from the national Superfund list, including a former Southington landfill now deemed safe.In all, 22 sites were removed from the Superfund list — the most taken off in 13 years."Under President Trump, EPA is deleting Superfund sites from the National Priorities List at the fastest pace in more than a decade," said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler."This remarkable accomplishment is proof that cleaning up contaminated lands and returning them to safe and productive use is a top priority of the Trump EPA," Wheeler said in a press release.The EPA recently completed reviews on four other Connecticut Superfund sites — in Naugatuck, Beacon Falls, Barkhamsted and Canterbury — and determined Superfund status should continue, which means further cleanup work and monitoring, and and land use restrictions stay in place.Environmentalists are wary of the EPA’s rush to delete Superfund sites and have expressed concern that a desire for redevelopment and new taxes could outweigh public protection.But Betsey Wingfield, an air and land management bureau chief for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said her agency agreed with removing the Southington landfill from the Superfund list.Here are the Superfund sites in Connecticut:Barkhamsted-New Hartford LandfillBeacon Heights Landfill, Beacon FallsBroad Brook Mill, East WindsorDurham Meadows, DurhamGallup’s Quarry, PlainfieldKellogg-Deering Well Field, NorwalkLaurel Park Landfill, NaugatuckLinemaster Switch, WoodstockNaval Submarine Base, GrotonPrecision Plating, VernonRaymark Industries, StratfordScovill Industrial Landfill, WaterburySolvents Recovery Service, SouthingtonYaworski Waste Lagoon, Canterbury"EPA consulted us and we agreed with full deletion," Wingfield said.Some state officials privately noted that the EPA, at least so far, has been deleting low hanging fruit — old sites in which cleanup work was essentially finished during former President Barrack Obama’s administration."The [EPA] administration was encouraged to clear the books," Wingfield said.Other sites removed from the list include a former chemical plant in Maine, an oil pit in Florida, a manufacturing plant in Massachusetts and a smelting operation in Utah.Southington deletedSuperfund status is the most extreme red flag that can be placed on property and draws federal intervention — and often dollars — to monitor the site, clean up contamination and protect the public from exposure.It usually comes with deed restrictions that limit what can be built on the property, such as a ban on residential buildings.The Southington landfill received domestic and industrial waste from 1920 to 1967 and was added to the list in 1984 after groundwater in a nearby municipal well was found to contain cancer causing volatile organic compounds at levels exceeding state standards.The EPA and DEEP oversaw cleanup of the contaminated soil, surface water and sediment and the adjacent Black Pond, as well as mitigation of vapor wafting into buildings downwind of the landfill.Groundwater will continue to be monitored and overseen by both the EPA and DEEP to ensure the effectiveness of a cap placed over the former landfill.Land use is also restricted, including a ban on residential and commercial buildings and disturbance of the pollution controls now in place. Passive recreation uses are allowed, pending review."The deletion of the Old Southington Landfill from the Superfund list signals important progress for communities here in Southington," said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn."The progress at these sites exemplifies EPA's and this administration's commitment to clean up contaminated sites while working with the local community every step of the way to ensure their concerns are heard and addressed," Dunn said in a statement.DEEP Commissioner Robert Klee also issued a statement in support of the deletion."Working collaboratively with the EPA, we are taking action to correct the mistakes of the past," Klee said.The Trump Administration has made deletions from the Superfund program a top priority. The EPA last year created a Superfund Task Force charged with recommending sites for removal, and to promote redevelopment."By redeveloping Superfund sites, communities are able to reuse thousands of acres of formerly contaminated land, often strengthening local economies," the EPA said.A total of 1,345 sites remain on the Superfund list, with 14 located in Connecticut.Site reviewFour Connecticut Superfund sites were reviewed this year by the EPA and those sites will remain on the Superfund list, which means continued monitoring and oversight.The sites are the former Laurel Park Landfill, a 35-acre parcel in Naugatuck, the Yaworski Waste Lagoon in Canterbury, the former Barkhamsted-New Hartford landfill and the former Beacon Heights Landfill in Beacon Falls.John Senn, a spokesman for EPA’s New England region, said the Connecticut sites reviewed are all former landfills and the most significant component of the cleanup is the landfill cover or cap."The reviews completed at these sites concluded that the remedies are functioning as designed and thus are still protective," Senn said.A review is required when hazardous substances remain at a site above acceptable levels, Senn added.Wingfield said the goal is to reuse Superfund sites when possible and pointed to the former Raymark property in Stratford as a prime example of how polluted property can be returned to the tax rolls. A part of that site is now a shopping center."It’s a prime piece of real estate," Wingfield said of the Stratford property. "They are still working on other units.”Other portions of the Raymark site remain on the Superfund list. Raymark sold brakes and clutches from about 1919 through 1989.Dunn said the five year review of Superfund sites is a "critical part" of the process."It helps ensure remedies remain protective of public health and the environment,” Dunn said, adding the goal is to "make sure the remedy will be protective of public health and the environment."bcummings@ctpost.com

By Amanda CudaCaptionCloseFairfield County has the most ozone-polluted air in the state for the 16th year in a row, and several other Connecticut counties falter badly on some measures of air quality.That's according to the American Lung Association's latest "State of the Air" report, released this week. The annual report ranks cities and counties based on their average number of unhealthy air days (for both ozone pollution and short-term particle pollution), and by annual pollution averages. This is the report's 16th year and Fairfield County has consistently ranked as the state's worst when it comes to ozone, said Ed Miller, a spokesman for the American Lung Association."I think it's one of the toughest places in the country, in terms of air pollution," he said.Indeed, Fairfield County is also the most ozone-ravaged in the New York-Newark metro area -- which comprises parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut -- and the 19th most ozone-polluted county nationwide.Ozone, or smog, is the most widespread air pollutant, and is created when the sun reacts with emissions from vehicles and other sources. Miller said it's possible that the presence of major highways including Interstate 95 in Fairfield County contribute to its ozone pollution.Locally, doctors echoed that theory, and at least one also named population density as a potential cause."Fairfield County has Stamford and Bridgeport, two of the state's larger cities, so it's not entirely surprising that we'd be among the state's bigger polluters," said Dr. David Kaufman, chief of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine at Bridgeport Hospital.Nationwide, nearly 138.5 million people live in counties where ozone or particle pollution levels make the air unhealthy to breathe, the Lung Association reports. In Connecticut, more than 3.2 million people live in a county with failing air quality.In addition to Fairfield, Connecticut counties getting a failing grade in ozone pollution were Hartford, New Haven, Middlesex, New London and Tolland counties. Litchfield and Windham counties both received Cs. The New York-Newark-Bridgeport metro area ranked 11th most ozone-polluted in the nation. When inhaled, ozone irritates the lungs, and can cause health problems ranging from wheezing and coughing to asthma attacks and premature death."If you have an existing lung disorder, (breathing polluted air) can definitely make it worse," Miller said. "We refer to it as a sunburn on the lungs."The report, which looks at data collected from 2011 through 2013, had some positive news for Connecticut. All the state's counties received passing grades for both short-term and annual particle pollution and Fairfield improved its grade for short-term particle pollution from a C to a B. New London and Litchfield again earned As for short-term particle pollution.Particle pollution is a mix of ash, soot, diesel exhaust, chemicals, metals and aerosols. These microscopic particles can burrow deep within the lungs, triggering serious problems such as asthma, heart attacks, strokes, and lung cancer.Miller said the state's improvement in particle pollution is likely due to several environmentally friendly changes, including cleaner-burning diesel fuel. But Connecticut's consistent ozone problem and continuing concerns about air pollution in general show much work needs to be done. Among other things, the Lung Association recommended that the Environmental Protection Agency needs to protect the Clean Air Act, a federal law designed to control air pollution. Though area doctors wouldn't necessarily weigh in on the environmental aspects of the report, they agreed that something needs to be done to protect the health of Connecticut residents."I see a lot of people who come in (with lung problems)," said Dr. Philip Greenspan, a pulmonologist at Bridgeport Hospital. "Certainly the air quality is not pristine here."

By Daniel TepferThe yard at the Public Works garage in FairfieldThe yard at the Public Works garage in FairfieldCaptionCloseThe yard at the Public Works garage in FairfieldThe yard at the Public Works garage in FairfieldFAIRFIELD - The town’s superintendent of public works is accused by police of accepting bribes and favors to allow a local construction company to dump truckloads of demolition material containing high levels of PCBs and lead onto property adjacent to the public works garage.Fairfield has been locked in a legal battle with Julian Enterprises since May 2017, when the town sued to force the company to pay the town $3 million in damages.But recently police raided the office of Julian Enterprises on Meadow Street in Fairfield, hauling away boxes of records. Police also obtained records from the Fairfield County Bank in Ridgefield.“These are simply allegations that haven’t been proven in court, and my client is confident they will be exonerated at trial,” said Julian’s lawyer, Thomas Cotter.Scott Bartlett, the town’s superintendent of public works, who has not been charged, did not return calls for comment.“These affiants have probable cause to believe that evidence of a conspiracy between Scott Bartlett and Julian Development personnel to commit environmental crimes as well as larcenies is located in the business offices of Julian Development AKA Julian Enterprises,” states the search warrant application for the company’s office that was obtained by Hearst Connecticut Media.A plan to recycle“Statements of town employees suggest that Bartlett was influenced by Julian Management through benefits provided him and/or his son, who is an employee of Julian Development and support the belief that Julian Development influenced Scott Bartlett by providing him with benefits,” the application states. “Bartlett allowed Julian Development to accept prohibited/contaminated materials at the Fairfield facility, making the operation of the facility highly profitable for Julian Development.”The investigation is now in the hands of the Office of the Chief State’s Attorney.The Fairfield Public Works Department generates several tons of material every year from the removal of old road surfaces and sidewalks, and from sewer and site construction. The town created a dump site for this material on town property on Richard White Way, aiming to convert the refuse into material that could be reused or sold for fill.In 2013, Julian Enterprises was awarded the bid to operate the processing facility with the goal of reducing the volume of material at the site. Julian would rent the site from the town for $9,000 a year, and while they had to accept material from the town at the site for free, they could charge private contractors a dumping fee to process material.According to the contract, Julian was prohibited from accepting hazardous or contaminated materials at the site.However, by 2016, the volume of material at the site had in fact increased instead of being reduced. In addition, there were numerous complaints of increased truck traffic through the center of town. This prompted the town to hire Cindy Knight, president of Logical Environmental Solutions, to investigate the site.On Nov. 29, 2016, according to court documents, Knight was at the processing facility shortly before 7 a.m., when she saw three Julian dump trucks unload piles of a gray-brown granular material at the extreme back of the site. She took samples of the material, which were tested and found to contain levels of PCBs six times greater than the state allowable level and lead at double the concentration considered hazardous.The site was immediately shut down.Payoff allegationsWarrant applications state that the documentation supplied by Julian Enterprises to the town said the tested material was part of a series of 20 truckloads that had been hauled from the construction site of the Land Rover/Jaguar dealership on Commerce Drive. The documents from Julian stated that the material was all disposable fill, rock and asphalt, the warrant affidavits state.Based on this information, in July 2017, then-Police Chief Gary MacNamara assigned detectives Frederick Hine and Michael Clark to begin a criminal investigation.Shortly thereafter, Hine interviewed Bartlett, who conceded, according to the warrant application, that the volume of unprocessed material at the site was increasing, contrary to the contract.But Bartlett contended that he allowed Julian to continue operating it because he didn’t believe the volume reduction expectation was attainable and because Julian provided, in Bartlett’s estimation, a $500,000 to $700,000 savings to the town. Bartlett told Hine he did not see any trucks that he suspected were carrying hazardous materials into the site, the warrant application states.The application states that Bartlett’s son, Steven Bartlett, is employed by Julian, which was not reported by the company.Hine interviewed four town employees who stated that Julian personnel were allowing hazardous material into the processing site, according to the warrant application.The application states that the employees told Hine that they complained to Bartlett, but he told them, “I don’t care what they bring in …as long as they take it out.”A former truck driver for Julian Development told Hine that the company had been accepting material containing asbestos at the processing site.“He stated Scott Bartlett had a ‘fishy relationship’ with the Julians and that the Julians gave Scott Bartlett’s son a job and they ‘gave the kid whatever he wanted,’’’ the affidavit states.During a company Christmas party, the former employee told Hine, he saw Jason Julian fold an envelope and put it in Scott Bartlett’s pocket while he shook Bartlett’s hand, the affidavit states.The company’s Facebook page showed photographs of Bartlett at the company’s Christmas Party two days after it was discovered that Julian trucks had dumped hazardous materials at the processing site.

By BRIAN NEARING Staff writerALBANY -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is taking responsibility from the state for the longtime Dewey Loeffel PCB toxic dump cleanup, and will pursue General Electric Co and two other companies to pay for it.On Tuesday, the EPA announced that it added the troubled dump to its Superfund National Priorities list, an action that had been in the works for nearly a year.EPA Regional Administrator Judith Enck said EPA will be "financially pursuing" three former customers of the private dump, including GE, Bendix Corp. and the former Schenectady Chemicals, now known as SI Group, to pay for the cleanup.There is no cost estimate yet for the work, but Enck warned "this is not going to be cheap." She said federal officials study "best remedies" to clean pollution once and for all, which will take "a considerable amount of time."EPA plans a public meeting on the project 7 p.m. March 24 at St. Mary's Church parish hall, 26 Church St., Nassau.The dump cleanup was first ordered by the state in 1968 to be done by Loeffel, its private owner. After a dozen fruitless years, the state took over the project in 1980. Three decades later, with the dump still leaking PCBs, the federal government is assuming control."Today is a whole new ballgame that is starting," said Kelly Travers-Main, whose grassroots group Uncaged that has pushed for the cleanup and celebrated its 10th anniversary last fall. "The EPA has more and sharper teeth. GE is still responsible for all off-site contamination. Polluter pays."Located about 4 miles northeast of the village of Nassau, the 16-acre unlined dump had been under the state Superfund pollution program since 1980, with the state Department of Environmental Conservation responsible for cleanup efforts.In 2009, with PCBs still leaking out of the dump and into the nearby Valatie Kill Creek and Nassau Lake, DEC asked EPA to take the project under federal Superfund.From 1952 until 1968, the dump legally disposed of more than 46,000 tons of PCBs, oils and solvents generated by several industries, including GE, Bendix and the former Schenectady Chemicals.PCBs are potentially cancer-causing substances and can cause neurological and other serious health effects, according to EPA. While millions of dollars have already been spent, the cleanup proved too pervasive for the state to finish. PCB-tainted fish from the two bodies of water have been listed by the state as unsafe to eat since 1980.After EPA said it was considering taking on the project, GE argued against federal involvement out of concern that the company, which believes it was absolved of liability for environmental damages by the state under a 1980 cleanup agreement, will face new bills if EPA is in charge.Enck said EPA was not bound by the 1980 agreement between EPA and GE.GE spokeswoman Joan Gerhardt said the company has been working closely with the state on the site for more than 30 years."We have met all of our obligations and will continue to do so," she said. "EPA has made its decision to add the site to its National Priorities list. We haven't seen its full evaluation of the site, but when we do, we will review it thoroughly. Going forward, GE intends to work with EPA as we did with New York state."Reach Nearing at 454-5094 or bnearing@timesunion.com.

By Brian NearingALBANY — New York is responsible for less toxic mercury pollution from electrical power plants than any other state around the Great Lakes, according to a report Wednesday by an environmental group.Issued as Congress debates blocking proposed federal rules to limit power plant mercury emissions nationwide, the report by the Natural Resources Defense Council found New York plants emitted 10 times less mercury than the worst state, Ohio, which unlike New York has no state rules to limit power plant mercury.The report compared New York, Ohio and six other states that are home to 144 power plants that burn coal, a source of mercury that leaves smokestacks and drifts eastward toward New York, carried on prevailing winds.New York, which adopted power plant mercury limit rules in 2007, was responsible for 239 pounds in 2010. The top three emitters — Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana — have no state limits, and their plants released about 2,900 pounds, 2,700 pounds, and 2,200 pounds, respectively.Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cause developmental problems, particularly in children and fetuses. It can accumulate in the environment, particularly in water, and mercury levels have rendered fish unsafe to eat in Lake Ontario for children and women of childbearing age.Mercury advisories are in effect statewide for bass, northern pike, pickerel, walleye and yellow perch. All eight Great Lakes states have advisories on fish consumption because of mercury contamination. Mercury can also build up in fish-reliant wildlife, like eagles and the iconic Adirondack loon, and cause development problems in the young.Report author Cindy Copeland said it shows an Environmental Protection Agency plan to cut plant emissions across the eight states by an average of 72 percent would protect public health and the environment.Heavy metalMercury emissions from power plants around the Great Lakes, in pounds, based on 2010 Environmental Protection Agency dataOhio           2,865Pennsylvania   2,720Indiana        2,174Michigan       1,924Illinois       1,484Wisconsin      1,269Minnesota        873New York         239 Nationwide rules also would benefit owners of plants that operate in states like New York with mercury limits. "Federal rules will help level the playing field," Copeland said.Less reliant on coal for electricity than other Great Lakes states, New York has seven such plants. Indiana has 21, Ohio 22 and Pennsylvania 33.Gavin Donohue, executive director of the Independent Power Producers of New York, a lobbying group that represents power plant owners, said consistent federal mercury standards for power plants across all states are the best approach.However, he said New York's rules are stricter than the proposed EPA rules, so plant owners here could still remain at a competitive disadvantage if the federal rules do not replace New York's rules.U.S. Senate Republicans led by Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe are expected to vote on blocking the EPA. A number of power plant owners are also suing in courts."This report underscores the urgent need for the recently finalized federal standards to take effect," said Jeff Seyler, president and CEO of the Albany-based American Lung Association of the Northeast. "New York has required power plant mercury reductions for more than two years, and we see the results, but air that enters our state is still too polluted."In addition to being in coal burned by power plants, mercury is also found in energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs, which last more than 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs. But the environmental impact pales compared to power plant pollution. It would take nearly 91,000 compact bulbs to gather a pound of mercury.Power plants in the report emitted about 13,000 pounds of mercury in 2010. For that amount of mercury to be released into the environment, about 1.1 billion of the compact bulbs a year would have be disposed of improperly. That is about four times the total number of bulbs sold nationwide in 2009.bnearing@timesunion.com • 518-454-5094 • @Bnearing10

By Brendan J. Lyons and Casey SeilerCaptionCloseAlbanyTrying to address a potential public health concern as well as widespread anxiety in a Rensselaer County community, Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration on Wednesday said the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant in the village of Hoosick Falls will be declared a state Superfund site.The designation extends from an emergency regulation, issued Wednesday, that will allow state to list perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA, a toxic chemical that has been found in elevated levels in the village's water supply, as a hazardous substance.Superfund authority allows the state to investigate the extent of any contamination, and to begin remediation immediately.State Health Commissioner Howard A. Zucker said the state will initiate a health-risk analysis, re-test private wells in the village and install filters at schools and other gathering places.The emergency regulations followed an unannounced private meeting Wednesday afternoon at the Capitol between the governor and school and government leaders from Hoosick Falls."We found a way for the state to take action which I believe is immediate and will ultimately be conclusive," Cuomo said in an interview with the Times Union.The governor said the situation in Hoosick Falls was similar to the state's recent experiences with the Ebola virus and Legionnaires Disease, situations in which the impact of very real health threats were worsened by sometimes overblown public fears."In Hoosick Falls, there was misinformation, conflicting information," he said, "and it appeared to be a situation that was getting out of control, and people (were) getting anxious. After anxiety comes anger, and the misinformation in and of itself can be destructive."Cuomo said the fear had emerged primarily "within the community — 'What is this? How dangerous is it? How sick am I, how sick are my kids?' And they can talk themselves into a situation that then gets reported in papers where nobody wants to move to Hoosick Falls, and the homes in Hoosick Falls are unsaleable. And people are now disrupted in a way that has nothing to do with reality."Wednesday's meeting took place after the Times Union reported that school and town leaders have been frustrated, in part, with their dealings with the state Health Department, which is leading efforts to test private wells in that area for contamination. The agency was informed of the toxic pollution in December 2014, but did not begin testing water supplies in that area until last July.At a hastily called news conference following Wednesday's meeting, Zucker sidestepped questions about why his agency had instructed village leaders in Hoosick Falls for more than a year that the levels of the toxic chemical found in the water were safe for normal use. The Health Department changed its position last month, in part, after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warned that the water was unsafe for drinking or cooking.Up to that point, Hoosick Falls Village Mayor David Borge had been telling village residents it was a "personal choice" whether to consume the water.The meeting with the governor included Borge, Hoosick Falls school Superintendent Kenneth Facin, Hoosick Town Supervisor Mark Surdam, Acting DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos and state Sen. Kathy Marchione, R-Halfmoon.Elevated levels of PFOA were found in the system in 2014 by Michael Hickey, a former village trustee whose father died of cancer. Hickey sent water samples to a Canadian lab that reported levels of PFOA that the EPA later said are not safe for human consumption.The EPA has established a guideline that a level of 400 parts per trillion is a safe level for "short-term" consumption of the water. But EPA officials said the agency is expected to lower that level significantly this year. Meanwhile, other states have set far lower acceptable levels of PFOA in public water systems, including New Jersey, which has set a level of 40 ppt.Zucker said the state Health Department is reviewing its position and will set a new safety limit in the coming weeks on the acceptable levels of PFOA for drinking water. The state's action comes as Hoosick Falls this week began installing temporary filters on its water-treatment plant that supplies water to several thousand customers."I think we have taken this very seriously," Zucker said, "and what happens is once we have a number ... obviously we are trying to be, and will be, more aggressive in bringing the level down from 400 (ppt). There hasn't been any health effects that we've noticed on this."However, Dr. Marcus E. Martinez, who runs a family medical practice here, said he and his father, who opened the practice in 1956, have noted rare and aggressive forms of cancer in patients, as well as thyroid diseased and other health problems. Martinez is also the Hoosick Falls school physician, but he was not allowed to attend Wednesday's meeting with the governor, a person briefed on the matter said. In December, the Times Union reported many residents in the village and town believe their community has been afflicted by rare and aggressive forms of cancer and thyroid disease.In the news conference, Seggos noted the Superfund designation "exists to enable the DEC to go out and spend money against the state Superfund remedial work. We then go after the polluter to recover those monies."PFOA is a man-made chemical used to make non-stick and other household and commercial products that are heat-resistant and repel grease and water. Under a deal with the EPA, major PFOA makers began phasing out its use in 2006. PFOA exposure has been linked to increased health effects, including testicular and kidney cancer and thyroid disease.Although the source of the contamination has not been identified, officials have focused on the Saint-Gobain plant, which is near several wells that supply Hoosick Falls' water treatment plant. The small factory, which Saint-Gobain bought in 1999, used the chemical for decades and is the village's largest employer with about 125 workers. The firm owns a second plant in the village with about 75 workers.Saint-Gobain used PFOA at its plants until December 2014, when it stopped using the chemical. Its own water tests, done as a result of Hickey's discovery, included results that showed levels of PFOA at 18,000 ppt in the groundwater under its McCaffrey Street plant — several hundred yards from the village's well fields.The governor's intervention on Wednesday came two weeks after the state called on the EPA to add Saint-Gobain's McCaffrey Street plant "and other possible sources of contamination" in the village to the federal Superfund program and "undertake a full environmental investigation to address the sources of contamination." The state's sudden call for action came on the same day a vocal citizens group, Health Hoosick Water, had scheduled a meeting at the local high school on the contamination. The informational meeting included officials with the state Health Department officials and EPA and drew a crowd of hundreds.Health Hoosick Water leaders in December said they were frustrated because state and village leaders were declining to heed their warnings about the potential dangers of PFOA in the drinking water."I think that we've been very proactive with this right from the very beginning," Borge said at the Capitol news conference. "... This has been a very difficult time, there's no question about it. It's been traumatic for folks not just in terms of health issues ... but just in terms of the fear that people have had and the concerns. Now we have something concrete we can go forward and show people that steps are being taken.""I am excited about what happened today and very appreciative," said Facin, the Hoosick Falls school superintendent.Saint-Gobain's decision to stop using PFOA at its Hoosick Falls plants took place the same month that the company told the EPA that PFOA had been found in the public water system.The state Health Department last month issued a fact sheet to residents downplaying the health risks of the toxic chemical until two weeks ago, when the state took a stronger stand and called on the EPA to set stricter standards on the acceptable levels of PFOA in drinking water. The state also said it would begin "an investigation of the incidence of cancer among village residents."Hoosick Falls has had a number of manufacturing plants dating to the early 1800s, including other plants that used PFOA or similar synthetic chemicals. In the last three months, the Times Union has interviewed current and former residents who suspect the drinking water may have caused cancer or other serious effects for themselves or relatives.There are also areas within the town and village, where some of the companies used to dump waste, that are becoming a focus of the EPA's investigation.The governor's actions occur as the nation is watching state officials in Michigan beset by criticism over their glacial response to lead contamination in the water supply of the once-bustling industrial city of Flint.Cuomo, who plans to visit Hoosick Falls in the next few weeks, said the state has "a full, aggressive plan to quickly understand the status of the situation, and perform an aggressive remediation."Matt Hamilton contributed reporting for this story; blyons@timesunion.com • 518-454-5547 • @brendan_lyonstu

By Jim ShayAfter Tuesday’s torrential rainfall, the Wesport Weston Health District is warning residents that their private wells could be contaminated.“If your well has been flooded, it needs to be disinfected and tested once the floodwaters recede and before you consume it,” said Director Mark A.R. Cooper.“With the amount of rainfall and flooding experienced on Tuesday, many yards were underwater for some period of time. All wells that have been flooded in pits or low-lying areas should be properly disinfected.”Westport received between 4 and 5 inches of rain, the most falling in the late afternoon.Cooper said septic systems could also be affected by floodwaters.“Though this might have created localized septic problems, the problems with such flooding should be temporary and have no lasting effects,” Cooper said.“Anyone experiencing problems with their septic system after the floodwaters recede should have the system evaluated by a licensed septic system contractor. It is recommended that all septic tanks be pumped and cleaned every three to five years depending on usage. This might be a good time to have this done.”

By Jim ShayDays after a spill of up to 6,000 gallons of hydraulic oil in the Naugatuck River, heavy rain is expected to flush the remaining oil into Long Island Sound.The spill happened Saturday afternoon after a frozen pipe broke at the Somers Thin Strip Company in Waterbury, spilling the oil out onto the property, pavement, soil and nearby Naugatuck River.State Department of Energy and Environmental Protection official Jeff Chandler said crews returned to the scene after reports of oil sheen on the Naugatuck River.Chandler said a large portion of the oil has already moved downstream and is not recoverable.During a press conference Monday afternoon, Chandler said absorbent and containment booms have been removed from the river in Seymour and Beacon falls in anticipation of heavy rain.“The surge of water (from the heavy rain) will help disperse the oil,” he said.Since the spill, an oil sheen has been seen on the river from Waterbury to Derby, where the Naugatuck meets the Housatonic River.Chandler said the oil sheen has been spotted as far south in Stratford where the Housatonic enters Long Island Sound.Chandler, who supervises DEEP’s emergency response unit, said there appears to be no damage to wildlife or aquatic mortality.“We’ve seen no distressed wildlife,” he said.Nonetheless, Chandler said anglers “should avoid fishing and the consumption of fish.”Because the oil is too thin to collect in the river, the cleanup will focus on removing contaminated soil at the plant.In recent decades the Naugatuck River has made a dramatic comeback from years of pollution.Factories in Waterbury, Naugatuck and Seymour dumped untreated industrial waste in the river for generations.Last fall, an estimated five million gallons of raw sewage spilled into the river from Waterbury’s Water Pollution Control plant.A large number of fish were killed from that spill that was cause when a a contractor cut a power line to the plant.According to River Alliance, a state group for river conservation, there were six other sewage spills into the Naugatuck River last year.Two of of them happened after the Oct 9 raw sewage spill.“During the massive rain storms Oct 29-30, from 100,001 to 500,000 gallons of sewage got into the river from an overflowing manhole at Waterbury's treatment plant, and from 501 to 1000 gallons overflowed from a manhole on High Street in Naugatuck,” the group posted on its web site.Earlier in 2017 from 1,001 to 5,000 gallons of raw sewage reached the river from a spill on Derby Avenue in Seymour on Sept. 9.The Waterbury treatment plant had a spill estimated to be anywhere from 500,001 to 1,000,000 gallons on April 16.A spill on Church Street in Naugatuck on Feb. 7 spilled an unknown amount of sewage in the river.“The Naugatuck's bad year began on Jan 20, 2017 when 650 gallons of raw sewage was bypassed into the Naugatuck River from the City of Naugatuck's treatment plant,” it said.

By Cathleen F. CrowleyCaptionCloseVoorheesvilleWater from a kitchen faucet used to fill water jugs in the cafeteria and jugs for after-school programs at Voorheesville Elementary School was contaminated with high levels of lead, according to the school district.The district issued a press release and posted the test results Monday after new water sample testing confirmed the lead contamination."Until we get this problem resolved, we are not going to be using any of those water outlets in the kitchen," said Brian Hunt, the school district's superintendent.Testing done on Aug. 19 showed that a kitchen faucet at Voorheesville Elementary School had 1,800 parts per billion of lead. Any level of lead exposure is harmful to children, but 15 parts per billion is the federal "take action" level.The faucet was shut off on the first day of school, Sept. 7, which was the day the district received the results from the August water samples.The Albany County Health Department told the district to retest the faucet because the initial result was so high it might be an error. A new sample collected on Thursday showed 822 parts per billion.In the wake of lead contamination in Flint, Mich., New York became the first state to require schools to test water for lead. A majority of homes tested in Flint last year had 27 parts per billion, though some had much higher levels from 400 to 13,000. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the new law on Sept. 6 and schools have tight deadlines to collect and test water samples from every faucet, water fountain and water outlet. Elementary schools must collect the samples by Sept. 30 and middle and high schools must collect samples by Oct. 31. The law also requires schools to notify parents and staff of test results within 10 days.High levels of lead can cause physical, mental and learning impairments in people, but young children are especially vulnerable."The concentration of lead, total amount of lead consumed, and duration of lead exposure influence the severity of health effects," said Dr. Elizabeth Whalen, the Albany County health commissioner. "The ACDOH will send out a field team to learn more about how the testing was performed at Voorheesville, and gather information that could shed more light on potential risk to students."The school district plans to offers free blood level lead screening for any student or staff member who wants it and is hosting a public meeting next week to discuss the test results with parents.Initial testing at Voorheesville Elementary School targeted high-priority water outlets, including drinking fountains and kitchen sinks, but all 82 outlets will be tested by the deadline, Hunt said. All of the drinking fountains and bottle fill stations tested below the 15 parts per billion standard, but two other faucets — a sink in a classroom and a sink in the transportation office — showed lead levels of 15 and 18 parts per billion. Both have been shut off until the problem is fixed.The retest of the kitchen faucet took two draws of water — the first collected water immediately after opening the valve and the second draw collected water after allowing water to flow for 30 seconds.The lead level fell to 10 parts per billion in the second draw. Both the health department and testing company advised the district that this indicates the problem is likely the faucet itself, even though the faucet had been installed in May."We are going to do everything we can to remediate this situation as quickly as possible," Hunt said.ccrowley@timesunion.com • 518-454-5348 • @townstu • http://facebook.com/cathleenFcrowley

The health impacts of lead poisoning include damage to the brain and nervous system, slowed growth and development, learning and behavior difficulties and hearing and speech problems.Major sources of lead exposure to children include lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in deteriorating buildings. Lead paint use was banned in the United States in 1978.Though lead poisoning in Connecticut’s children has decreased over the past 15 years — because of mandatory childhood screening and primary prevention effort — the state’s housing stock is among the oldest in the country; many houses still contain lead paint.The state’s data show that black and Hispanic children in Connecticut are at greater risk of being lead poisoned than children of other races.Here are some simple things parents can do to help protect their family from lead exposure:Get your child tested — Even if your young children seem healthy, ask your doctor to test them for lead. Mandatory screening is the law in Connecticut.Learn about drinking water — Water pipes in some older homes may contain lead solder where lead may leach into the water. Understand the facts: DPH can provide you with helpful information about preventing childhood lead poisoning.For more information, visit ct.gov/preventlead, or for Spanish educational materials, visit ct.gov/plomo, or contact the DPH’s Lead, Radon and Healthy Homes Program at 860-509-7299.

By Bill CummingsAs controversy swirls around lead found in public drinking water in Flint, Mich., high levels of the heavy metal continue to be found in some Connecticut water systems.The Parkway School in Greenwich last year found lead levels roughly twice the federal allowable limit for drinking water, and the Georgetown Business Condo Association in Redding discovered lead ranging from 17 parts per billion to 190 ppb.Lead levels over 15 ppb exceed federal thresholds and require corrective action, such as treating the water to make it less corrosive or replacing the piping system. Temple Shalom in Norwalk is on a state list of public water systems out of compliance with lead standards, and students at the St. Joseph School in Brookfield drink from bottled water coolers and only wash in sinks because of high lead levels in the school’s well water.“Safe drinking water is crucial for the health of Connecticut’s residents, and the Department of Public Health takes very seriously our responsibility for protecting this valuable resource,” said Raul Pino, DPH commissioner. And the quality of Connecticut’s drinking water is good, with 99 percent of the state’s 2,500 public water systems in compliance with federal lead standards, according to the state health departmentLead contamination testsExceeding the threshold of lead in drinking water of 15 parts per billion triggers an EPA action alert. A test at 40 ppb is considered an “imminent” threat to pregnant women and children.Test siteTownppb**Cederhurst Assoc.Newtown17 ppbGrumman Hill Montessori Assoc.Wilton18 ppbParkway SchoolGreenwich32 ppbSaint Joseph SchoolBrookfield19 ppbAquarion WaterBrookfield17 ppb*Lake Lillinonah Shores CondoBrookfield20 ppbTemple ShalomNorwalk28 to 46 ppb Still, the health department acknowledged 14 public water systems are out of compliance and said corrective action is being taken.On the listWater systems that do not comply include the Hawthorne Terrace Association in Danbury, Parkway School in Greenwich, the Cedarhurst Association in Newtown and the Temple Shalom in Norwalk.Lori Matthieu, chief of the state health department’s drinking water section, said residents served by those water systems are aware of the lead problem. “We have verified that each of the systems currently out of compliance has notified residents of the [lead levels] and the steps needed to avoid contaminated water until further testing confirms levels have decreased below the federal standard,” Matthieu said. The Flint water system over the last year became a poster child for lead contamination. Years of neglect resulted in lead samples approaching 400 ppb, as well as serious health problems, particularly among children.Lead in water, even at low levels, can cause health problems for pregnant women and young children and damage brains, reduce IQ levels and cause attention disorders, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Adults can experience kidney trouble, high blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems.The acceptable level for lead in drinking water is zero, according to the EPA’s website.  But while EPA has no regulatory authority over private water systems, such as wells, the agency and the state regulators are empowered to regulate water provided by public water systems. If more than 10 percent of tap water samples exceed the federal threshold of 15 ppb, providers are required to take additional action, such as corrosion control treatment, educating the public and replacing lead lines. Lead contamination is often the result of corrosion in the plumbing system.A USA Today investigation published this week, based on EPA data, found lead levels exceeded federal standards in 2,000 water systems spanning all 50 states, and accounting for water supplied to six million people.The report found 600 water systems in which tests showed lead levels over 40 ppb, more than double the EPA's action level limit.Spotty problems The discovery of lead in water at the Parkway School in Greenwich alarmed parents and prompted calls for infrastructure upgrades and better oversight of the school’s water system. Testing was increased and lead filters were installed on fountains.School officials say they have since found no lead beyond trace amounts below the EPA limit. Tests last September produced results of 38 ppb.Eric Einstein, a member of the Georgetown Business Condo Association, said lead got into the association’s water system as it traveled through pipes in the old building. But Einstein said the lead wasn’t a big issue for residents of the office complex because it doesn’t have any restaurants or residences and people were already bringing their own water bottles to work. “From a health point of view, it wasn’t really a problem,” Einstein said, adding the condo association has resolved its lead problem by adjusting pH levels to neutralize the water.Brian Wallace, a spokesman for the Bridgeport Diocese, which operates the Saint Joseph School in Brookfield, said lead problems with its well go back 10 years. “We shut off the water fountains and set up water stations” Wallace said. “Sinks are used only for washing. We test the water daily and three times a year. The parents are aware and we have not had any complaints.” Mary Ann Jacob, a resident of the Cedarhurst Association, said high lead levels were likely because of water left standing in the pipes for long periods of time. “In any home, if you have copper pipes and leave the water sitting, that can cause corrosion and that corrosion can bring lead out of the pipes,” Jacob said, adding residents generally live in the seasonal Lake Zoar community during the spring and summer and leave pipes inactive in the winter.John Herlihy, vice president of water quality for the Bridgeport-based Aquarion Water Company, said a Brookfield water system the company purchased within the last five years failed one of 10 tests of customer water, posting a result of 17 ppb. Herlihy said the cause was from lead pipes entering the home. Other causes can be lead solder and faucets. “We supply high quality water to 70 public water systems,” Herlihy said. “All 70 of those systems are in compliance with federal limits.”Alex Wolf and Katrina Koerting contributed to this report.

By Bethany BumpCaptionCloseCapital RegionNine Capital Region school districts received water test results over the past week showing elevated lead levels in their water fountains, sinks, showers and other places, according to notices published on district websites.Results will continue to pour in this fall as schools across the state work to comply with a new state law requiring the testing. The Times Union is posting results daily on its Schools BlogThe new law requires all public schools in New York to test water for lead at any outlet that is currently or potentially used for drinking or cooking. If a source shows lead levels above 15 parts per billion, a district is required to shut it off, and develop and implement a remediation plan — whether that be replacing pipes, faucets and other parts, or making bottled water available to students.The latest districts to post results include Berne-Knox-Westerlo, Cohoes, Duanesburg, East Greenbush, Guilderland, Hoosic Valley, Stillwater, Waterford-Halfmoon and Wynantskill.Most contaminated water came out of classroom and bathroom sinks meant for hand washing or lab experiments. Four districts, however, had contaminated drinking or cooking water. Those results are below:• Harmony Hill Elementary School, Cohoes: Room 104 bubbler water fountain (53 ppb)• Farnsworth Middle School, Guilderland• four sinks in Family and Consumer Sciences classrooms (15, 15, 20, 19 ppb)• one drinking fountain in corridor by gym (47 ppb)• two kitchen steam kettles (40, 105 ppb)• Hoosic Valley Elementary School: Room 65 classroom bubbler (198 ppb)• Waterford Halfmoon Elementary School: Water fountain in the elementary girls' locker room (17 ppb)New York became the first state in the nation to require comprehensive water testing in schools when the law was passed on Sept. 6. Districts had until Sept. 30 to test elementary schools, and must post the results within 10 days of receiving them. They had until Oct. 31 to test all other schools.Lead exposure is particularly harmful to young children, even at low levels. Prolonged exposure can result in lower IQ, behavioral problems and brain damage. The toxic material enters drinking water when pipes containing lead corrode, especially if the water running through them has high acidity or low mineral content. Human skin does not absorb lead in water, so sinks that are used for washing are not cause for worry.bbump@timesunion.com • 518-454-5387 • @bethanybump

Alex ParkCaptionCloseBreathing in Houston can be hazardous to your health.That's the finding of a new report from the Environment Texas Research & Policy Center. It found that more than 6.7 million people in the Houston metro area experienced 85 days of degraded air quality in 2016, increasing the risk of premature death, asthma attacks and other adverse health impacts.The report, Trouble in the Air: Millions of Americans Breathe Polluted Air, is part of an annual project that uses Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) records to monitor air-pollution levels across the country. It focused on smog and particulate pollution, which result from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, diesel, gasoline and natural gas.The Texas report is a joint effort of Environment Texas, the Frontier Group and the TexPIRG Education Fund. It received financial support from Environment America, a national environmental advocacy group funded by member donations and various foundation grants.ASKING FOR HELP: Activists want Abbott to better protect Texans from pollution in case of another Harvey"This report serves as a critical reminder that there is still much work to be done to improve air quality and protect public health in Houston," said Bakeyah Nelson, executive director of Air Alliance Houston.Air Alliance Houston is currently evaluating the possible health effects of a planned expansion of Interstate 45 through north Houston, a project that has been discussed since 2004. The organization is especially troubled about the potential health effects on students who attend schools along the freeway, because children are more vulnerable to the adverse health effects of air pollution.These concerns are supported by the findings of Trouble in the Air."There are two statistics that we used to determine when Houston and other cities had bad air days," Brian Zabcik, a clean water and air advocate from Environment Texas."One was high readings of ozone, and the other was high readings of what's technically known as particulate matter," he said.LAWSUIT: Environmental group sues EPA over pollution rules, cites Houston refineriesAccording to the report, ground-level ozone, commonly known as smog, can cause minor respiratory problems such as coughing and wheezing, to more serious conditions such as asthma, an increased risk of infection, and permanent damage to lung tissue.Particulate pollution not only triggers similar respiratory problems, but can result in cardiovascular harm in the form of heart attacks, strokes, congestive heart failure, and reduced blood supply to the heart. The report also links particulate pollution to premature birth, increased risk of autism, stunted lung development in children, and a higher risk for dementia.EPA figures show that in Texas, 48 percent of smog-forming nitrogen oxides came from mobile sources such as cars and trucks. Twenty percent came from oil and gas production and refining, 13 percent from industrial sources and 9 percent from electricity generation."It's no surprise that Houston has so many bad air days, because Houston has so many cars," Zabcik said.One policy that could have helped Houston's air quality was the federal clean car standard, an EPA regulation issued during the Obama administration.MEASURED: Online tool to track air pollution in Texas debuts"It called on auto manufacturers to gradually reduce the amount of emissions that are produced by their vehicles," Zabcik said. "This is hugely important because the biggest contributor to both urban air pollution and one of the biggest contributors to global warming is emissions from vehicles."Scott Pruitt, the current EPA director, announced last year that the agency would seek to repeal this key regulation. The Trump appointee's pledge concerns environmental advocates."To protect our health, we must keep cutting smog, particulate pollution and global warming pollution," said Zabcik. "We must accelerate our progress, not hit the brakes on effective programs like the federal clean car standards."

By Frank JulianoCaptionCloseFairfield County has the worst air quality in the state, according to a new American Lung Association report, and the next few days will be even worse than usual.Although all eight Connecticut counties received an F grade for ozone levels on the report, “The State of the Air,’’ Fairfield had the highest weighted average, 24.3, compared to 16.3 for New Haven.All of Connecticut fared much better in the category of particle pollution, with New Haven County earning a C and Fairfield County a B.In a separate but related development, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is warning that today, Thursday and possibly Friday will see unhealthy air quality throughout the region.High temperatures and wind carrying pollutants into Connecticut during the next few days will increase the ground-level pollution, DEEP spokesman Dennis Schain said.DEEP advises residents — especially children, the elderly and those with respiratory diseases — to avoid strenuous activity outdoors and to exercise before noon or after 8 p.m.The Department of Public Health advises those with respiratory conditions to stay indoors, with air-conditioning to dry, cool and filter the air.But it is usually ozone, and not particulates, that causes the region’s “bad air,’’ officials say. The American Lung Association ranks the severity of the unhealthy air by color, with purple being “very unhealthy,’’ red for unhealthy and orange representing air that is unhealthy for those with breathing difficulties including asthma.There were no purple days in Fairfield County, but the region led the state in both red days, with 18, and orange days with 46 over the past three years included in the study. New Haven had 10 red days during the period and the other six counties were all in single digits.The "State of the Air 2016" found continued improvement in air quality in 2012 to 2014, showing lower levels of year-round particle pollution and ozone. Still, more than half of all Americans—166 million people—live in counties where they are exposed to unhealthful levels of these pollutants, according to the American Lung Association.Although the DEEP and the Lung Association agree that Connecticut’s air quality has improved over the past several years, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decision to reduce the national air quality standard for ground level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion will likely mean more unhealthy air quality days in Connecticut this summer.

By Jo KroekerCaptionCloseFederal and state regulators requested additional soil testing at Western Middle School to confirm the depth and width of contamination by PCBs and other materials in the ground there, a school official said this week.The known contaminated areas are substantially delineated, said Greenwich Public Schools Chief Operating Officer Lorianne O’Donnell, but officials at the federal Environmental Protection Agency and state Department of Energy and Environment Protection want more testing conducted this summer in order to be certain.“Once completed, we should have enough information to engage in a meaningful discussion with the agencies regarding potential remediation options,” O’Donnell said in a statement.School officials announced the extension of testing Tuesday.Part of Western’s fields reopened for student use in September 2017. But a large portion, including the softball infield, has remained closed and fenced off since August 2016, when high levels of PCBs, arsenic, lead and chlordane were found in the soil.The highest concentration of PCBs was found in a corner of the field farthest from Western Middle School. One sample taken 3 inches deep in the soil found PCBs in concentrations six times the federal threshold for hazardous waste.This summer’s testing will include groundwater sampling. Once testing is completed to the regulatory agencies’ satisfaction, Langan, the consulting group leading the project, will develop remediation work plans for the fields. Those plans will be submitted to the EPA and DEEP for aproval.Representatives for Langan, the EPA and DEEP could not be reached this week for comment.jo.kroeker@hearstmediact.com

By Cedar AttanasioMILFORD — State officials closed down Connecticut’s largest seed-oyster bed Friday after what they described as repeated disregard for harvesting regulations.Of about a dozen shellfish harvesters tapping the Housatonic River Natural Oyster Seed Bed, only one was consistently following rules to prevent river pollution from contaminating the animals.“Today’s early closure will help protect the public from consuming contaminated oysters,” said Steve Jensen, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Agriculture.Specifically, Jensen said, harvesters repeatedly failed to move oysters to separate beds in Long Island Sound so they could be cleansed of pollutants.“That step is required because shellfish concentrate bacteria and viruses associated with effluent discharged from sewage treatment plants, which can cause illness in people if they are eaten,” he said.It was unclear how long the ban would last, and how the closure will affect oyster supplies and prices. Officials said they are reaching out to harvesters to address the infractions and reauthorize harvesting. However, there are only two weeks left in the season before the beds are closed for spawning.

By Frank JulianoCaptionCloseMONROE — Work to excavate and remove soil contaminated by home heating oil is continuing this morning, and Judd Road at Hattertown Road remains closed.About 140 cubic yards of contaminated soil was removed on Tuesday, said Cyndy Chanaca, spokeswoman for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.Another 260 gallons of home heating oil was recovered from ground water, she said. In all, about 1,770 gallons of home heating oil was spilled when a truck owned by Parkway Fuel Inc. of Fairfield struck a tree and partially overturned on Monday morning. An interceptor trench dug by a contractor hired by Parkway Fuel has been successful in keeping the home heating oil from reaching the Pootatuck River.“No oil migrated to the interceptor trench,’’ Chanaca said in an update, “(but) the road will remain closed until the area is restored.’’Several homes and businesses in the area depend on well water, and state officials said that samples have been taken from those wells. Monitoring equipment is being installed to insure the quality of the drinking water, Chanaca said.Police said that at the time of the accident the truck contained about 2,100 gallons of heating oil. The operator of the fuel truck, Robert Farina, was issued an infraction for failure to drive in the proper lane, said Lt. Rosalie Stuart of the Monroe police. About 380 gallons were recovered from the truck and another 260 gallons were recovered from ground water, DEEP spokesman Dennis Schain said. Contractors excavated some 140 cubic yards of contaminated soil—about seven dump truck loads.

By Kenneth C. Crowe IITroyRensselaer County has found PFOS, a toxic contaminant, in four private wells tested in the town of Petersburgh during a program to find out if PFOA had contaminated local wells, county officials said Thursday.The PFOS results were announced at a recent briefing for town residents, said Chris Meyer, a spokesman for County Executive Kathleen Jimino.PFOS is an acronym for perfluorooctane sulfonate, which may be used for foam in fighting fires and was an ingredient in Scotchgard resulting in the product's removal from the market. Like PFOA, the acronym for perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOS is considered toxic. The county is retesting the water samples from the four wells in which PFOS was found, Meyer said.Taconic, which is the source of PFOA contamination in the town, has told the county that it did not use PFOS in its manufacturing processes, Meyer said. The source of the PFOS is not known and could have resulted from firefighting at a site or another source, Meyer said.Filters have been installed for PFOA contaminated wells in Petersburgh and in nearby Hoosick and Hoosick Falls.As of April 15, the last time the county issued an update of its well testing program, 94 samples had been taken. Results of another 50 samples are still being tested.The results show 20 samples with PFOA reading of less than 20 parts per trillion. Any well with a result of more than 100 ppt is considered to have water that is unfit for use under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.The remaining readings were 17 samples between 21 ppt and 100; 19 samples between 101 ppt and 1,000 ppt; seven samples more than 1,001 ppt; and 1 samples were listed as "non-detect," which is less than 0.67 ppt.kcrowe@timesunion.com • 518-454-5084 • @KennethCrowe

By Emilie MunsonCaptionCloseGREENWICH — Five years after the discovery of PCBs and other contaminants in the ground at Greenwich High School, much remediation work has been completed, but a long and expensive path to clean soil remains. With no timeline for finishing in sight, Greenwich’s Public Works Director Amy Siebert said she estimates the town could spend around $14 million more to clean up the toxins permeating the high school’s property. She cautioned costs could go higher, however, and even range up to $20 million.“All those project costs are going to be dependent on when we get to (remediation), exactly what we end up having to do,” she said. “Ideally, if the world were great, maybe it would come out to be a little less because we’ve done some work in the western parking lot already, but we can’t predict it will be less.”Construction crews first discovered the contaminants in July 2011, shortly after beginning work on the high school’s $44 million Musical Instruction Space and Auditorium complex. The town’s cleanup plan was approved by state and federal environmental agencies in November 2013, and since that time, work has been twofold — simultaneously testing and remediating the soil, while keeping tabs on the groundwater below.Soil work began in 2014, and after two years of efforts to remove PCBS and other toxins from the property, all fields and paths at GHS are open, an environmental testing update released by the district and town of Greenwich last week announced. Soil remediation has been completed on the south side of Greenwich High’s campus, in the vicinity of Cardinal Stadium, Siebert said.But some areas between the west parking lot and athletic fields three and four still require remediation and remain fenced off. “These areas will remain inaccessible to the general public until the final sitewide remediation is complete,” the update said.Other areas around fields two, three and four are not fenced off, but need remediation. Toxins in these areas are deep enough that they do not pose a risk to people using the fields for typical recreation, according to officials, but they will be removed so the areas are safe for maintenance staff who might dig to address irrigation issues.Cleanup will include the excavation and off-site disposal of between one and three feet of impacted soil from these areas.“We try to be careful and conservative, as does the town, and really just try to be protective of human health and the environment,“ said Mike Doherty, vice president of AECOM, an environmental consulting firm, and program manager for the project.When cleanup for these areas will begin is not clear. For now, town officials are waiting for approval of their remedial action plan to come from state agencies. “We have ongoing work that we are doing to answer some of their questions,” said Siebert. “One cannot dictate that timeline. The folks in Hartford are very busy. We are not the only project in the state of Connecticut.”Remediation projects lasting more than four years are typical, Siebert said. The remediation of Cos Cob Park took over a decade, Doherty said. For now, the town can continue its groundwater monitoring, which it began in February 2012. Scientists test the groundwater quarterly using a network of 29 monitoring wells installed at the site.“We’ll monitor for PCBs, metals, some semi-volatile organics. There’s a variety,” Doherty said. “We found PCBs in a couple of monitoring wells.”Monitoring tests continue to show the contaminated water is not migrating out of the GHS footprint, officials said. That’s because the soil that the groundwater moves through has trapped the metal-based contaminants.“You can think of the soil, or the material underneath there, as kind of like a sponge,” said Siebert. “You know that you can flow water through a sponge. You know that you can get coffee grounds in your sponge and water will still flow through it, but the coffee grounds have a tendency to sort of stay put in there.”Groundwater testing will continue throughout the year and into summer 2017 to monitor for possible migration.Contaminants in the groundwater are not threatening drinking water. Aquarion Water Company provides potable water to the high school and all residences in proximity to the site.Siebert urged the public to remain patient with remediation.“This is nothing new. How to sample soil and characterize soil is a standard process, and you just go through these things in a step-wise fashion,” she said. “I think it can be frustrating for the public because everyone wants answers right away.”emunson@hearstmediact.com; @emiliemunson

A lawsuit filed recently in Madison County names past and present owners of the Wood River Refinery in Roxana as defendants. It claims that owner WRB Refining LP as well as past owners Conoco Phillips and Shell Oil are responsible for polluted groundwater around the plant. It was filed by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan.She alleges that the companies allowed contaminants to enter the groundwater under the refinery and migrate beyond the refinery’s property line to the village of Roxana.“These companies must be held accountable for the environmental and public health damage caused by this contamination,” Madigan said in a statement.Madigan said the lawsuit seeks a complete assessment and a plan to restore the quality of the groundwater and subsurface to pre-contamination conditions “and to protect the people living in Roxana.”The suit claims that the three companies have allowed oil, gasoline and other toxins to permeate the groundwater in and around the plant. It seeks the maximum civil penalties of $50,000 per violation and an additional $10,000 a day for violations of the state environmental laws as well as reimbursement of costs for the investigation and cleanup.

It’s a long-term problem that has plagued the region for years and requires difficult solutions.In fact, all of Connecticut received an “F” for ozone levels in the latest lung association report, with the number of unhealthy air days far highest in Fairfield County.“As the commissioner recently said, Connecticut is the tailpipe of America,” said Paul Farrell, assistant director of state’s air planning unit, echoing remarks by Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Robert Klee.Farrell said the gas that results in ozone blows into Connecticut from across the country, particularly from states like Pennsylvania, which has a heavy concentration of coal fired power plants.The reason is weather and a prevailing wind which tends to blow east, he said. “Generally, weather patterns set it up,” Farrell explained. “The I-95 corridor and sea breezes all influence this, and it comes together to impact Fairfield County. We look at the lung association report and agree with it. They are correct.”Farrell said state researchers are now looking at the role Long Island Sound plays in trapping ozone along coastal Connecticut and in Fairfield County.“We are now looking at the influences of Long Island Sound and how air flows over the Sound,” Farrell said. “It’s something we are trying to learn more about.”Connecticut has sued states and power plants in an effort to force compliance with the federal Clean Air Act, and sometimes those efforts were successful.In 2013, the owners of a Pennsylvania power plant agreed to stop burning coal in two generating units, and provide $1 million for environmental mitigation in Connecticut and New Jersey, as part of a clean air settlement.In June, Connecticut filed a petition with the federal Environmental Protection Agency over emissions from the Brunner Island Steam Electric Station in York County, Pa. The petition seeks remedies for pollution wafting into Connecticut from the plant.Public healthThe lung association and others have long urged reductions in emissions from power plants, gas and oil operations and diesel engines to lower ozone levels.Progress has been made, experts note, and the lung association said in its latest report that ozone and particle pollution levels are going down nationally, and in Connecticut. “Across the nation, the report found continued improvement in air quality, but more than half of the people in the United States live in counties that have unhealthful levels of air pollution,” said Jeff Seyler, President and CEO of the American Lung Association of the Northeast.The threat to public health continues to draw calls for more action to reduce ozone emissions and particle pollution, more commonly known as soot.“Ozone is harmful to public health and especially children, older adults and those with asthma and other lung diseases,” said Ruth Canovi, manager of Public Policy for the American Lung Association in Connecticut. “When older adults or children with asthma breathe ozone-polluted air, too often they end up in the doctor’s office, the hospital or the emergency room,” Canovi said.David Hill, a member of the American Lung Association in Connecticut’s leadership board, said more needs to be done to save lives.“The Lung Association calls on Connecticut’s leaders to continue working to improve the air we breathe,” Hill said. “In this difficult budget climate, Connecticut must protect our clean energy programs. We urge our leaders to adopt a strong clean power plan to reduce harmful emissions from power plants that worsen climate change and immediately harm health.”

By Shawn R. Beals, CTNewsJunkie.comKatie Dykes, commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.Katie Dykes, commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.CaptionCloseKatie Dykes, commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.Katie Dykes, commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.HARTFORD — The state task force examining PFAS chemicals is recommending widespread testing of public water supplies and studies of contamination sources in response to the growing public health concern over the potentially toxic substances found in thousands of consumer goods.Scientists and health officials are still studying the long-term effects of exposure to PFAS (per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances), but the chemicals are pervasive in our environment, our food and our bodies. PFAS are thought to cause higher cholesterol levels, decreased immune response, slower growth and learning, behavioral effects, and increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer.The draft report from the panel’s work this summer was released Oct. 1.The task force established by Gov. Ned Lamont in July includes representatives from 20 state and quasi-public agencies including the Department of Public Health, Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, Connecticut Airport Authority, the governor’s office, UConn and the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities. DPH Commissioner Renée Coleman-Mitchell and DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes were appointed to lead the group.The task force report includes a series of recommendations to minimize the exposure of Connecticut residents to PFAS, minimize future releases into the environment and address past PFAS contamination. A primary recommendation is identifying likely contaminated sites.There are more than 4,700 substances classified as PFAS, and they are used in a staggering number of consumer and industrial products. Fabric softener, pizza boxes, cosmetics, water-resistant clothing, adhesives, non-stick cookware, and food packaging were just a few of the everyday products listed by DEEP officials at the first task force meeting July 30.“I believe our action plan is going to be a very proactive. Look at what’s happening out there,” said Lori Mathieu, drinking water section chief at DPH and co-chair of the human health subcommittee of the PFAS task force. “We’ve done a lot in a very short period of time and we’re somewhat ahead of where other states are.”The report’s first recommendation is to conduct testing of the 2,500 water systems, 150 reservoir systems and 4,000 groundwater sources that make up the public water supply in Connecticut. It also recommends testing private wells near any public water sources found to have PFAS contamination, and assessing food sources of PFAS exposure like agricultural production or fish and shellfish.The report also recommends testing bottled water and requiring producers to use only sources for bottling that are approved by the DPH.Sections of the task force report deal heavily with firefighting foam, a super-effective fire suppressant but a visible and abundant source of PFAS contamination. Though the state has been studying PFAS extensively since 2016, the massive release of foam into the Farmington River in Windsor through the sewer system after an accidental activation of a fire suppression system in a private hangar at Bradley International Airport brought the task force into being.Mathieu said this week that the task force’s work primarily focused on human health, remediation and prevention.“There is no doubt it was about how humans are being affected and how we’re going to find out how people are being exposed,” she said. “We know there’s really a lack of federal action, and we know we need to take action because of the effects on human health and the environment.”Brian Toal, the other co-chair of the human health subcommittee and interim environmental health section chief at DPH, said food sources are an area of risk still being studied extensively right now. There are limited ways to avoid PFAS products and food containers, because many labels don’t list whether the product contains fluorinated substances, he said.“Food in general is a significant contributor to the public [exposure],” Toal said. “Everyone has some PFAS in their blood. To a large extent that’s probably from food.”Lamont gave the task force an Oct. 1 deadline to submit an initial draft. Once public comments are incorporated, a final report will be submitted by Nov. 1.Toal said only five of the 4,700 PFAS chemicals have been identified as toxic, and there is too little information on the rest to make a definitive conclusion about their health effects. Other states and countries have moved to classify them as as potentially hazardous as a group rather than individually, he said.“There’s a national push to try to consider all of these as a class of substances that should be regulated,” Toal said.Lamont has asked the task force to hold a public hearing before its work is finalized, said David Bednarz, a spokesman for the governor.“Governor Lamont feels that receiving input from the public is a critical component of the mission of this working group, which is why he asked them to hold a hearing before any report becomes finalized. There are many groups and citizens who are understandably concerned about this issue, and the governor wants their input included in the group’s work,” Bednarz said.The state will collect public input on the findings until Oct. 15. Comments can be submitted at  ctpfas@ct.gov  or by mail using the instructions at bit.ly/pfas-action-plan-20191001.

By Gary Stoller Conn. Health I-Team WriterCaptionCloseConnecticut companies that violate permit conditions by discharging unsafe levels of toxic metals and other dangerous pollutants into state rivers and streams rarely face fines for those violations, a C-HIT analysis of federal data shows.Among those violators is Autoswage of Shelton, which in 2013 poured 517 percent more copper and 58 percent more iron into the Housatonic River than allowed under its wastewater discharge permit. The company was not fined for the violation.Over the last three years, 29 of 60 companies holding permits to discharge into a state waterway failed to comply with strict limits for potentially cancer-causing pollutants, the C-HIT review of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data revealed.Only two companies were fined by state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection — a trend state environmental advocates called alarming.“The record of noncompliance with permits in Connecticut is extremely disturbing,” said Margaret Miner, executive director of Rivers Alliance of Connecticut. “While some of the violations are undoubtedly minor, some are serious, and all deserve scrutiny.”Autoswage Products was found to be in noncompliance during 10 quarters, including the last quarter of 2013, when it discharged 517 percent more copper and 58 percent more iron into the Housatonic River than its permit allowed. More than allowed: Wastewater discharge violations2013 - Autoswage of Shelton discharged into the Housatonic River517% more copper | 58% more iron2016 - UniMetal of Thomaston discharged into the Naugatuck River293% more cyanide | 40% more copper | 16% more nitrogen2016 - U.S Navy submarine Groton base discharged into to the Thames River100% more oil and grease | 2015 - 690% more oil and grease2014 - Allnex of Wallingford in discharged into the Quinnipiac River258% more aluminum | 2015 - 3,020% more acrylonitrile2015 - Connecticut Galvanizing of Glastonbury discharged into the Salmon Brook223,000% more zinc | 1,980% more leadHere are some of the wastewater discharge violations found by C-HIT:Autoswage of Shelton in 2013 discharged 517 percent more copper and 58 percent more iron to the Housatonic River than allowedUniMetal of Thomaston in 2016 discharged 293 percent more cyanide, 40 percent more copper and 16 percent more nitrogen to the Naugatuck River than allowedU.S Navy submarine base in Groton in 2016 discharged 100 percent more oil and grease and in 2015 discharged 690 percent more oil and grease to the Thames River than allowed.Allnex of Wallingford in 2014 discharged 258 percent more aluminum and in 2015 discharged 3,020 percent more acrylonitrile to the Quinnipiac River than allowed.Connecticut Galvanizing of Glastonbury in 2015 discharged 223,000 percent more zinc and 1,980 percent more lead to the Salmon Brook than allowedAutoswage President Keith Brenton said the company, which manufactures contact and connector pins, recently emerged from bankruptcy and has no plans to discharge wastewater in the future. DEEP officials said the agency denied renewal of Autoswage’s discharge permit, and the company has not discharged since December 2013.DEEP officials said the enforcement record is justified and stressed that regulators monitor permit compliance and determine what type of enforcement response is warranted. DEEP said the agency often works with companies to bring them into compliance.“Any violation is grounds for enforcement action, but that does not mean that all noncompliance is immediately actionable or always subject to formal enforcement and penalties,” said Oswald Inglese, DEEP’s director of water permitting and enforcement.Still, Inglese conceded the mountain of monitoring data DEEP receives is so large that reviewing all of the information “far exceeds the capacity of department staff.” State Rep. James M. Albis, D-East Haven and the House deputy majority leader, said the state’s oversight may not be sufficient to keep pollution from flowing into vital waterways such as the Connecticut, Naugatuck, Housatonic, Thames and Quinnipiac rivers.“Personally, I think if companies are blatantly and maliciously disobeying the law, they should face consequences, regardless of what the state’s budget situation is,” Albis said.“The reality is that we need enforcement and compliance staff to ensure that this is happening, and in difficult budget times, these types of staff tend to be on the chopping block, or positions are not filled after retirements,” Albis saidNot in complianceThe federal Clean Water Act only allows companies with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit to directly send wastewater to a body of water. The permit limits what kind of material can be discharged and the amount, and sets monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure discharges do not contaminate water and impact public health. Any noncompliance is considered a violation and grounds for enforcement action, such as fines or imposed remedies, or loss of the NPDES permit. The C-HIT review found that, between October 2013 and September 2016, 19 companies exceeded their discharge limit by more than 100 percent.The data also showed that 23 of the 60 companies with NPDES permits were in noncompliance for at least half of the three year period studied for reasons ranging from excessive discharges to submitting late discharge reports.Thirteen companies were found in significant noncompliance — the most serious level of violation — for three months or more, the data showed. While DEEP has authority to fine or take court action against polluters, EPA records show it more commonly issues notices of violation for noncompliance or warning notices, opting to work with violators for months or years to correct the problems. Copper and ironOnly two companies, Allnex USA of Wallingford and ReEnergy Sterling, were fined by DEEP for violations of their NPDES permits over the three-year period, the review found. DEEP levied a $52,000 fine in 2014 against Allnex, which discharged into the Quinnipiac River, and a $45,000 fine in 2014 against ReEnergy Sterling, which discharged into the Moosup River.Four industrial permit holders — Connecticut Galvanizing of Glastonbury, UniMetal Surface Finishing in Thomaston, Plainfield Renewable Energy in Plainfield and the U.S. Navy’s submarine base in Groton — were found in noncompliance every quarter from October 2013 to September 2016, the data shows.None of the companies, nor the sub base, were fined by DEEP, records show.In 2016, UniMetal discharged 293 percent more cyanide, 40 percent more copper and 16 percent more nitrogen to the Naugatuck River than allowed.UniMetal President George LaCapra Jr. said the company is cooperating with DEEP “on how to best meet our current and future NPDES permit obligations.”Connecticut Galvanizing was issued a violation notice in 2012 and two more in 2014 for exceeding discharge limits. By mid-2014, Inglese said DEEP “escalated the matter into a mediation effort between Connecticut Galvanizing and other involved parties” to allow the company to install a storm water treatment system required by its permit.But despite that effort, in late 2015 Connecticut Galvanizing discharged storm water runoff into the Salmon Brook containing 223,000 percent more zinc and 1,980 percent more lead than allowed, the C-HIT review found. Connecticut Galvanizing paid a $45,000 fine to the federal government and nearly $150,000 to the Farmington River Watershed Association to settle a lawsuit brought by the Environment Connecticut and Toxins Action Network, under the Clean Water Act in October 2016.Connecticut Galvanizing did not respond to requests for comment.Not good enoughRoger Reynolds, the legal director of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment and Save the Sound, said companies found in noncompliance should be immediately fined and not given months to comply. Reynolds said DEEP is staffed by “good people,” but added the agency is “radically under-resourced,” and regulators “don’t do a whole lot of enforcement.”Connecticut Fund for the Environment conducts its own investigations of discharge violations and, if appropriate, files suit against violators, Reynolds said.Inglese said DEEP’s enforcement response is focused on significant violations.“Any violation is grounds for enforcement action, but that does not mean that all noncompliance is immediately actionable or always subject to formal enforcement and penalties,” Inglese said. Companies found in noncompliance for months or years are not automatic candidates for fines, he explained. “Case-by-case circumstances vary and must be evaluated based on their specific situations,” he said.Inglese noted companies may be implementing “a long-term plan to reduce or eliminate noncompliance,” or are out of compliance because of an error on a permit application or “external impediments” beyond their control.

By Linda Conner LambeckCaptionCloseFAIRFIELD — The sole supplier of fill to the future Harding High School construction site in Bridgeport is the same company that managed a Fairfield stockpile of dirt found to be contaminated with lead and PCBs.None of that contaminated fill was brought by supplier Julian Enterprises to the former GE property in Bridgeport, said J. Carver Glezen, an environmental consultant working for the city. “The fill material which was brought to Harding was tested in advance and was clean. No contaminants detected,” Glezen said of sample testing.Some members of the Bridgeport school board remain unconvinced and have asked for ongoing, continuous testing of the site — not just tests on the truck loads of dirt as they arrive. Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, are federally regulated cancer-causing chemicals that are sometimes found in industrial waste.“We have children and professionals who will be on that property six to eight hours on a daily basis,” Sauda Baraka, a board member said. “In some cases, young women of child bearing age. Children on fields practicing for games. We need to make sure location is safe.”Board member Howard Gardner said his concern is that the clean fill, over time, could be contaminated by what lies below the former GE complex — despite installation of a cap on the site — and by runoff from a nearby polluted pond.Glezen said his firm, Triton Environmental Inc., will conduct some testing.“Just to be sure,” he said.The former GE site has had to undergo a massive clean up at GE’s expense to remove a century’s worth of toxic waste — including PCB’s, lead, and arsenic — to make it safe enough for a school based on current Department of Energy and Environmental Protection standards.The clean up involved the removal and replacement of four feet of topsoil with a capping in between what was left, and the new soil. The new, four-story, 145,500-square-foot school building will provide “capping” over a large portion of the school property.The $106 million project is scheduled to be completed by March 2018. Footings and foundation construction on the new school is well underway and the steel superstructure is due to be erected starting next week.The cleanup work was approved by the state Department of Energy and Enviromental Protection. Despite that, Amanda Killeen, an environmental analyst for DEEP, said on Thursday that testing periodic of the property is in the hands of the licenced environmental professional assigned to the project, not the state. In this case, that would be Glezen.Fairfield ‘spoils’Glezen said some 50,000 cubic yards of fill was brought to Harding, all by Julian Enterprises, a small excavation firm founded in 1995.The fill brought into GE, he said, came from Milford months ago and was spot tested to make sure it was clean.Julian Enterprises had a contract with Fairfield to oversee fill on Richard White Way in the town. The contract expired Dec. 15, at which point, Fairfield conducted some environmental testing at the pile, which has been in place for decades. The fill pile was comprised of crushed rock, asphalt, concrete and dirt, along with the “spoils” from street sweeping and catch basin cleaning.Julian was allowed to bring in other material to mix with the fill pile, in order to make a saleable product. At one point, the pile contained an estimated 60,000 cubic yards of fill.Environmental testing after Julian left found a small amount of contamination by lead and PCBs, according to Stanton Lesser, Fairfield’s town attorney. Still, the site was shut down and DEEP was contacted.Calls and emails left for Julian Enterprises were not returned this past week. In a letter to the school board, however, the firm called the tainted soil an isolated incident.“In our three years there has never been a contamination issue,” the letter reads.Bridgeport board member Maria Pereira said the letter was not enough. She too wants independent testing of the Harding property.“Sounds like they were doing their job,” said DEEP’s Killeen of the contamination being detected in an unused pile and not headed to a job site.Still, Glezen said when he heard of the Fairfield situation, it was concerning enough that more testing was done at Harding. He said the undeveloped land in Milford where the Harding fill came from was also visited.“I am comfortable it is clean fill,” Glezen said. “The fact that (it was)one sample from one load in Fairfield that tested below residential ... shouldn’t cast doubt on all the other testing we have done.”Even so, periodic new testing will be done.“It is a small price to pay,” said Alan Wallack, school construction coordinator for the Bridgeport school district.

Theresa Sullivan Barger, Conn. Health I-Team WriterCaptionCloseDespite efforts by the state to curb mercury in the air and water, unhealthy levels of the element in most fish persist, resulting in restrictions on local fish consumption."Mercury is a really big issue," said Gary Rose, director of engineering and enforcement at the Bureau of Air Management the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. "It's local. It's national. It's international."Exposure to mercury, through the air or by eating mercury-laden fish, is toxic to humans. In recent years, there were signs that levels of the substance were declining in the state's water. A University of Connecticut study of fish found that in 22 lakes tested statewide where year-over-year comparisons were done, the overall mercury concentration declined by 17 percent, from 0.41 parts per million in 1995 to 0.34 parts per million in 2005-06, the most-recent data available. However, that's still higher than the .2 parts per million that's the threshold for unhealthy mercury levels.Also, fish in seven waterways, including Canoe Brook Lake in Trumbull and Lake Kenosia in Danbury, contained increased levels of mercury, the study by UConn Professor Christopher Perkins showed. While the study doesn't test the fish in rivers and streams, the state Department of Public Health declared a fish consumption advisory for all the state's waters. Since much of the mercury contamination comes from the air, officials know that it's in the lakes and rivers, said state DPH epidemiologist Brian Toal.  Mercury's health risksMercury can attack the central nervous system and damage the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and immune system. Developing fetuses and small children are especially susceptible, and mercury can cause neurological and developmental damage.  Based upon blood sampling data, federal scientists estimated that between 300,000 and 630,000 infants are born in the United States each year with mercury levels that are associated, at later ages, with the loss of IQ, according to a report published by Environmental Health Perspectives. Research attributed this to pregnant women's consumption of mercury-contaminated fish.The state DEEP has worked to lower mercury levels through implementing tighter emissions restrictions, banning the manufacture and sale of most mercury-added products and encouraging proper recycling. For instance, nationwide, only an estimated 2 percent of household compact fluorescent light bulbs are recycled properly, according to the Association of Lighting and Mercury Recyclers.  In Connecticut, only 4 percent of households participate in hazardous waste collection days, which is when mercury-containing CFLs, thermostats and thermometers should be recycled.Instead, those items usually end up in one of the state's trash-to-energy plants, where, through the disposal process, mercury gas is emitted into the air and eventually pollutes waterways and ends up in fish. While 40 percent of mercury pollution in Connecticut comes from out-of-state sources such as Midwestern coal-fired plants, volcanoes and other sources of pollution, 60 percent comes from in-state sources -- primarily the state's six trash-to-energy plants and its one coal-fired plant in Bridgeport. In 2012, the coal-fired PSEG Power Bridgeport Harbor Station, operating a total of 561 hours, emitted 0.33 pounds of mercury, while the state's trash-to-energy plants collectively emitted 48.52 pounds of mercury, DEEP figures show. That's enough mercury to contaminate 28.8 million fish, according to Professor Robert Mason, of the Marine Sciences and Chemistry Department at UConn's Avery Point campus in Groton.Still, there have been mercury reductions in some local freshwater fish and those are due, in part, to the New England governors' commitment to a "virtual elimination goal for mercury" made in 1998. "Subsequently, that included placing mercury control devices on waste incinerators and coal-fired power plants both in Connecticut and throughout the region," said Michael Bender, director of the Mercury Policy Project. "The good news is that we are making a dent in reducing local pollution, but the bad news is that national and international sources of mercury continue to rain down on us."Fish consumption advisoriesWith fishing season here, people who get their fishing licenses receive the state DPH advisories on eating fish caught in Connecticut waters. In a video created by the Connecticut Health I-Team, several local fisherman were interviewed at Jimmy O's Bait and Tackle in Bridgeport and said they generally stick to the guidelines. "You just use your own judgment," said Thomas St. Cyr, of Stratford. "But basically, I don't want to get sick."Jimmy O's owner, Jimmy Orifice, said he feels most fish in the region are safe to eat, but he and other fishermen do take precautions. "We bleed the fish when we catch them," he said. "Most of the toxins are in the blood."Meanwhile, multiple studies report that those with fish as a dietary staple and subsistence fishermen eat the fish they catch far more frequently than the health advisories of once a month for pregnant and nursing women and small children, and once a week for adults."Lower-income people are affected a lot worse" by mercury in the fish, said Dr. Mark Mitchell, co-chair of the Environmental Health Task Force for the National Medical Association, who researched people fishing in the Connecticut River.  "When I asked Latinos, African Americans, Asians -- they all said they ate the fish. Nobody threw the fish back," Mitchell said. He found that the sustenance fishermen were unaware that they were required to get a license to fish in public waters.  The state health department has the equivalent of a full-time person working with nonprofits and religious institutions that serve low-income people to educate them about fish-consumption restrictions. "We send information to physicians. We send it to tackle shops and town halls," said DPH's Toal.  "It's labor intensive. We do as much as we can with the resources that we have. We probably don't do as much as we could."For the state public health fish consumption advisories, visit http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?a=3140&Q=387460.Stores in Connecticut that recycle CFLs are: IKEA, Home Depot and Lowe's.This story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (www.c-hit.org)

Kate KingCaptionCloseStamford -- Health officials are urging homeowners to test their drinking water after 70 percent of five dozen private wells sampled since the beginning of the year tested positive for uranium contamination.Uranium is a naturally occurring element that can seep into drinking wells through nearby bedrock. People who are exposed to high levels of uranium for a sustained period of time are susceptible to kidney problems, said state Department of Public Health Epidemiologist Brian Toal."The primary health risk for uranium is potential damage to the kidney," Toal said. "It's really not a radioactive hazard, even though it's a radioactive element. Therefore, it's not considered a large cancer risk."Stamford, which has offered subsidized well-water testing for carcinogenic pesticides since March 2012, recently added heavy metals contaminants to the list. The Health Department has tested 60 private wells for arsenic and uranium so far this year; 42 samples contained uranium.Fourteen wells, or about 23 percent of the five dozen tested, contained uranium contamination in concentrations at or above the recommended federal health limit of 30 micrograms per liter. "In Stamford, the percentage of wells that have been found over the (federal health) standard are quite high," Toal said. "At the levels we're seeing in well water, we would not expect to see people with overt kidney damage or problems. But if someone has a very high level, it's a good recommendation for them to go see a doctor."Toal characterized "very high" uranium concentrations as 100 to 300 micrograms per liter. Several years ago, a private well in Newtown tested positive for uranium at levels exceeding 900 micrograms per liter.The family of six had their kidney functions tested and one child demonstrated a "slight abnormality," which went away after several months of drinking clean water, Toal said."In most instances (uranium poisoning) is reversible," he said. "There's a fairly simple test that can be done to check your kidney function. But for most people, we'd say just stop drinking the water and you'll be fine."It's not clear how widespread uranium contamination is statewide, Toal said. The state health department is coordinating water testing across 30 to 40 towns and expects to complete the study this fall."We get calls for isolated reports all over the state," he said. "We think it occurs in pockets, and that it's higher in some places than others, but we don't have a complete picture yet."The Stamford Health Department has been sampling private drinking wells for two years, but only began offering arsenic and uranium testing Jan. 1."Even if you tested before for pesticides and volatile organic compounds, you need to test again," said Director Anne Fountain. "You don't know what you're going to find until you test."So far arsenic, which was detected in the drinking water of 81 Weston homes last year, has only been found in one Stamford well, Health Laboratory Director Jim Federici said.Stamford is the first municipality in the state to embark on widespread, subsidized testing of private well water. The program, which costs the city about $60,000 annually, is scheduled to run through the end of 2015.Stamford began investigating well-water contamination in May 2009, when chlordane and dieldrin were discovered in North Stamford private drinking water. Originally, city officials thought a nearby polluted landfill was the source, but local and state health officials now believe the contamination, which has been found in private wells all over the city, is linked to historic pesticide use.To date, the Health Department has tested 1,261 of Stamford's 5,000 private wells for pesticides, which were detected in about 13 percent, Federici said. Fewer than 2 percent of all wells tested contained chlordane in levels exceeding recommended health standards, while about 3 percent tested positive for high levels of dieldrin.City Rep. Gail Okun urged residents to sign up for the city's testing program, but stressed that it's up to homeowners to pay for any necessary filtration systems."There's no reason to panic," said Okun, vice chairwoman of the Board of Representatives' Water Supply Committee. "If you find that the naturally occurring uranium is present, you do what you have to do to make sure it's remediated."Treatment systems for pesticide and heavy metal contamination are different, Fountain said. "Even if you have a filter for the pesticides, it's a totally different filtration system for uranium," she said.Remediation for pesticide contamination involves installing a granular carbon-activated filter that costs about $1,600 and treats the entire house's water supply. Uranium only poses a health risk when it is ingested, however, so homeowners can attach filters directly to their kitchen faucets to treat the water they cook with and drink."Uranium is not a risk for bathing, showering and inhalation," Toal said. "It's OK to brush your teeth with it."Karen DeFalco, president of the neighborhood advocacy group North Stamford Concerned Citizens for the Environment, said she tests her well water every year."We cannot take for granted what's in our water," DeFalco said. "It's important that we test and keep testing. You might have been fine one year and you might not be fine the next year. It's about being proactive."Homeowners pay a flat $100 fee to participate in the city's well-water-testing program.

The holes were refilled after sample soil was removed.BRIDGEPORT — State and local officials, under the watchful eye of the Office of the Chief State’s Attorney, were ripping up the popular Gould Manor Park in Fairfield on Wednesday fearing to find truckloads of toxic waste.Meanwhile, what police called the alleged ringleaders of a scheme to hide the waste, Scott Bartlett, the superintendent of Fairfield’s Department of Public Works, and Jason Julian, the vice president of a local construction company, were arraigned on bribery, dumping and larceny charges in Superior Court Wednesday morning.Neither man entered pleas Wednesday and Judge William Holden continued the case to Sept. 18. A third man charged in the case, Fairfield Director of Public Works Joseph Michelangelo, is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday.Bartlett and Julian’s lawyers, Frederick Paoletti Jr. and Thomas Cotter, declined comment as they left the Golden Hill Street courthouse with their clients.Senior Assistant State’s Attorney Tamberlyn Conopask, who is prosecuting the case for the chief state’s attorney’s office, also declined comment.According to court documents, Bartlett and Michelangelo conspired with Julian, a former Barnum Festival ringmaster and co-owner of Julian Enterprises, to allow Julian’s company to dump soil containing toxic levels of lead and PCBs on Town of Fairfield property adjacent to the town’s public works garage.The cleanup of that site has already cost Fairfield taxpayers more than $779,000 and that figure is expected to go higher as more dumping locations are discovered, according to court documents.The documents detail how Bartlett had fallen into a deep financial hole. His $628,000 Fairfield home was in foreclosure, he had defaulted on $48,000 in credit card bills and he owed nearly $3,000 in Fairfield property taxes.And then, police said, Julian came into the picture.He hired Bartlett’s son and “Gave the kid whatever he wanted,” court documents state. Witnesses told police they saw Jason Julian slip an envelope into Bartlett’s pocket during a Christmas party.In 2013, Julian Enterprises became the sole bidder to run Fairfield’s Construction Material Processing Facility after two other bidders dropped out, according to court documents. Under the contract signed between the town and Julian Enterprises, Julian would process soil and non-hazardous materials from town building sites at the facility to be sold as clean fill. Julian would pay the town $3,000 per three-month term to run the facility.But suspicions were raised when the pile of debris at the site began getting bigger, not smaller, as it was supposed to.The town hired Cindy Knight, president of Logical Environmental Solutions, to test the site but Michelangelo told her to concentrate her sampling on just the new stuff that had been brought in, the affidavit states.Knight disregarded this and, making an unannounced visit to the dump site, found PCBs six times greater than state allowable levels and lead levels double what is considered hazardous by state and federal law.During a two-year investigation, Fairfield police detectives Frederick Hine and Michael Clark interviewed town employees who said they warned Bartlett and Michelangelo that Julian trucks were dumping suspicious materials at the processing site, but that Bartlett responded, “I don’t care what comes in as long as it goes out.”The detectives also secured emails in which Bartlett defends Julian Enterprises from complaints by Fairfield residents and reveals plans to “shut them up,” the documents state.And instead of paying the required $3,000 rent payments to the town, the affidavits state that Bartlett submitted false credit claims to the town on behalf of Julian Enterprises resulting in the town paying the company $27,000 when it actually owed the town $30,000 in rent.

By Joel Connelly, SeattlePIBOULDER CITY, Nev. -- During most of the 20th century, presidential forays into the West were occasions to celebrate concrete achievements -- dams that impounded great rivers, nuclear reactors that manufactured plutonium or irrigation projects that turned the desert (and agribusiness profits) green.The promises heard from Democratic presidential hopefuls before Nevada's Saturday caucuses could not be more different.Sen. Hillary Clinton has pledged to "end for good" the U.S. Department of Energy's multibillion-dollar, quarter-century effort to build a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, in the desert north of Las Vegas.Clinton is pledging to shift the nation's energy emphasis away to "clean, renewable energy," and told a forum here: "We can't do it if we have to continue to subsidize the carbon industry, while trying to move away from it."A few hours later, former Sen. John Edwards said, in effect, I'll see you and raise you one. Edwards was speaking in the hall of the Carpenters Union, one labor organization that has been sympathetic to the Yucca Mountain project. He pledged to shut down the nuclear repository, block construction of additional nuclear power plants and declare a moratorium on "building any new coal plants in America."Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois holds open the prospect of more nuclear plants, but has pledged to shut the door on Nevada's waste dump. "I will end Yucca Mountain," he said in a speech Tuesday. "Billions of dollars have already been spent on a mistake."Edwards' coal moratorium would apply to such projects as a pair of big, 750-megawatt coal-fired power plants proposed for remote Ely, Nev., by two Nevada power companies . Other power companies are separately seeking to build another coal plant near Ely, as well as a power plant in Mesquite northeast of Las Vegas.It's a 180-degree turn from days when Harry Truman whistle-stopped through the West, warning that Republicans would turn the region "into a wilderness," or when U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Floyd Dominy proposed plugging the Grand Canyon with two high dams. One would have flooded Lava Falls, the Colorado River's most treacherous rapid.A turnaround in attitudes also has swept the West. A big part is urbanization. The desert has bloomed with cities: Close to 2 million people live in the Las Vegas area and 3 million in Phoenix, with phenomenal growth from Bend to Cedar City to Boise to the Tri-Cities. In some places, too, rural residents have risen in opposition to what they see as detrimental industrial development. Small towns and ranch folk along Montana's Rocky Mountain Front even made Dick Cheney blink when the vice president and other Bush administration officials wanted to open federal lands to natural gas development. The feds were forced to back away from their plans.It's now understood that dangerous activities and polluting industries can't just be stuck away in a remote corner of the country where they'll have no effect.Atmospheric nuclear testing created a "cancer cluster" in towns downwind of the Nevada test site. Air pollution from coal-fired power plants is not only warming the Earth, but clouding our views of its beautiful places.Ely, Nev., is pretty far away from population centers, but it's just 50 miles from Great Basin National Park, renowned for having some of the nation's cleanest air and clearest nighttime views. "Like a clean white page, the relatively clean air in the Great Basin can be marred easily," Paul DePrey of the National Park Service wrote to state officials earlier this week. Critics worry about the effect power plants may have on nearby national parks and monuments. A few years back, Arizona's power lobby had to yield to public pressure and install emission-reducing equipment at the Navajo power plant, located a few miles outside Grand Canyon National Park."Views are what the Grand Canyon is about. And Zion. And Bryce Canyon. Without views, what is the Grand Canyon? It's just a big ditch," former Interior Secretary (and Arizona Gov.) Bruce Babbitt exclaimed on a recent Seattle visit.With Yucca Mountain, a particular message has hit close to home.About 11,000 rail shipments would be required to fill the nuclear waste repository. It would mean two to three trains, containing caskets full of nuclear fuel rods, passing through Las Vegas each week. Six big trucks a week could be expected. And, according to Dr. Fred Dilger, a safety expert, the shipments would go on for 38 years.Nevada still has rural islands of support for nuclear dumps and coal plants. Still, attitudes have changed. In the 1980s, when the feds began nuclear repository work, the state's main interest was to maximize tax revenue. The Legislature created a new Bullfrog County consisting of a square around Yucca Mountain. The huge, rural Nye County, wanting its cut, sued to get rid of the new county."The Legislature ultimately retreated, and we were treated to newspaper headlines saying, 'BULLFROG COUNTY CROAKS!' " joked Democratic state Sen. Dina Titus.According to polls, 80 percent of Nevadans hope the Yucca Mountain project enjoys a similar fate.

By Joel Connelly, SeattlePISeveral houses along scenic Chuckanut Drive, south of Bellingham, are decorated with Tea Party-inspired yard signs saying "WE THE PEOPLE" with a backdrop of the fluttering Stars and Stripes.Given the movement's agenda in Congress, a more appropriate slogan would be "WE THE POLLUTERS" against a picture of Bellingham Bay (or Port Gardner Bay at Everett) back in the 1960s when pulp mill pollution and raw sewage made for bubbling water the color of tobacco spit.The right-wing populists of the Tea Party movement are enacting an agenda for plutocrats -- the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Big Oil, Big Coal and the Koch brothers -- in the U.S. House of Representatives.  In one ambitious environment-energy appropriations bill, they seek to roll back almost 40 years of lawmaking to clean up the American earth (and water).Do you think this is an exaggeration?  Consider the 39 pending riders to the bill, or 38, now that Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., has succeeded in killing the "extinction rider" that would have eviscerated the Endangered Species Act."I have served on the Appropriations Committee for 35 years and never seen anything like this:  They are serving up a smorgasboard for special interests," said Dicks.  Or, in the words of Clean Air Act author Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., the new Republican House majority "seems intent on restoring the Robber Baron era" of the 19th Century.Some examples of the new corporate populism:-- Dirty Air:  A "polluter paradise" rider orders the Environmental Protection Agency to stop all work updating clean air standards for smog, soot and other pollution sources in places where "background" levels of that pollution are occasionally higher than what's needed to protect public health.-- Cementing Pollution:  A "concrete memorial" or "this boy's life" rider blocks EPA health protections designed to control smog, soot, mercury and other toxic pollutants emitted by cement plants.  A companion rider blocks the EPA from factoring in the best scientific/medical information to update clean air standards for "coarse particle pollution," e.g. soot.-- Mercury Contamination:  A Republican rider denies EPA money to enforce the Clean Air Act's forthcoming Mercury and Air Toxics standards from power plants and recently finalized Cross-State Air Pollution rules. ( A chlorine plant put mercury into Bellingham Bay in the 1970's.)-- Blowing Up Mountains:  Republicans from Appalachia have written a rider that would block EPA review of mining that blows the tops off mountains (and contaminates nearby streams), or revising Bush-era rules that opened up streams to receive tailings and dirt from blown-up mountaintops.-- Timber Industry Relief:  A rider sponsored by Washington GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler would amend the Clean Water Act, creating a loophole that exempts the timber industry from having to get pollutant discharge permits for silvicultural activites.-- Manure in Water:  A GOP rider would stop the EPA from using its money -- cut $1.7 billion in the appropriations bill -- to implement, administer or enforce new water quality standards limiting manure, fertilzer and sewage flowing into Florida's fresh waters.-- Uranium and the Grand Canyon:  A rider would open federal lands adjacent to Grand Canyon National Park to extensive uranium mining, potentially contaminating a crown jewel of the National Park system and key Southwest waterway.Of course, some lawmakers in the party of Theodore Roosevelt would go even further.  A GOP presidential candidate, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., would abolish the EPA.  She calls it the "job destroying agency" and has had kind words for carbon in the atmosphere.The House GOP strategy appears to be a variation of the old throw-spaghetti-against-the-wall approach.  They will load up the appropriations bill with extreme provisions before sending it to the U.S. Senate, hoping a good chunk of the odious stuff survives.  President Obama would have the choice of signing a deeply flawed bill into law, or having the federal government run out of money. With the debt ceiling crisis, maneuvering by anti-environment extremists in the House is getting almost no attention from the press.  They are picking up momentum in a bid to dismantle a heritage of environmental protection that dates back to President Nixon (and his two ex-Seattlite aides John Ehrlichman and Bud Krogh) and Washington Sen. Henry Jackson.But this is the backstage cut-and-thrust of government:  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is reaping a handsome return on its massive investment in the 2010 elections.  The Koch brothers' vehicle, Americans for Prosperity, can point to the big bucks that helped elect Rep. Herrera Beutler.A final question:  Where is "Big Green," the potent environmental lobby and grass roots effort that thwarted Interior Secretary James Watt in the Reagan administration, and blocked Tom "The Hammer" DeLay during the Gingrich Congress?Recently, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg gave $50 million to the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, designed to shut down America's most pollution power plants.With the appropriations bill loaded up with Big Coal riders, haven't heard a peep from the club or received any kind of white paper on pending dark deeds. (The NW Sierra Club office will probably send out a press release 20-24 hours after the House takes final action.)A lesson here:  Don't get too wound up in the insular teapot politics of Seattle when the Tea Party and its corporate masters are restoring the ability of power plants, refineries, factories and mega-farms to pollute at will.

By Daniel Cohan, Rice UniversityCaptionCloseWhen the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its new tighter standard for ozone smog in October, predictable lines of debate emerged. Opponents claimed reducing ozone would be too costly and not yield measurable benefits. Environmental groups argued 70 parts per billion (ppb) was not tight enough to protect public health, after external advisors and internal staff recommended a 60 to 70 ppb range.Both sides are wrong. I've studied the issue as a scientist, and in my view, ozone smog harms health even at levels below the previous 75 ppb standard. While there is an achievable path to reduce the worst of these health hazards, it is also true that the EPA's new 70 ppb standard will prove impossible to attain by 2025 in several regions — including Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. THE EPA acknowledges that parts of California will need extra time to reach the 70 ppb standard. However, EPA claims all other states can achieve 70 ppb by 2025 or sooner. After reading the EPA's  own analysis, I don't believe attainment that soon is possible.Some improvements are bound to happen, no matter what a state does: Let's call those "on-the-way" emission control measures. Those include more stringent Tier 3 fuel and vehicle emission standards, and power plant emission reductions expected under the Clean Power Plan and other policies.The EPA projects these “on-the-way” measures will not be sufficient to bring the Los Angeles-South Coast and the San Joaquin Valley into attainment. EPA thus plans to give those regions support and longer attainment timelines. OUTSIDE OF California, the EPA isn't giving other regions extra time or help. And admittedly, many places won't need it. The EPA uses the best available methods for photochemical modeling and analysis to project that most regions currently exceeding 70 ppb will attain the standard by 2025 based solely on "on-the-way" measures — in other words, without making any extra effort. In Texas, those regions include San Antonio, El Paso, Killen-Temple-Fort Hood, Tyler, Longview, and Granbury.The problem comes, though, in more polluted areas — the regions that can't rely on "on-the-way" measures to bring them into 70 ppb attainment by 2025. The EPA claims it is possible for all regions outside of California to hit that standard by adding new controls.On this point, I must dissent. I’ll illustrate the impossibility of attainment by 2025 specifically for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria and Dallas-Fort Worth non-attainment regions.EPA's analysis estimates reductions of 123,000 tons of NOx per year would be needed in eastern Texas to bring Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth into attainment by 2025. Houston’s attainment would require an additional 20,000 tons of hydrocarbon reductions.But these tonnages of emission reductions are unfathomably large for eastern Texas to achieve in ten years. Where could these cuts of 123,000 tons of NOx and 20,000 tons of VOC possibly come from?They can't come entirely from industry. Houston industrial sources are already capped at around 3,000 tons. Total NOx emissions from all major facilities throughout Texas (not just eastern Texas) were only 121,000 tons in 2014.So what about Texas' other great source of pollution: vehicles?There's simply not much that a city or state can do about them. Fleet turnover is already considered in “on-the-way” controls. And opportunities for states to control vehicle emissions beyond fleet turnover are limited.  ADMITTEDLY, MY past research on ozone and particulate matter has shown state implementation plans do succeed in achieving air quality standards. The pattern fits the environmental management adages that regulation breeds innovation, and that what gets measured gets done.The history of air quality management has shown repeated instances of industry decrying the cost of new standards, only to meet them more affordably than expected. For example, from 1980 to 2014, air pollutant emissions fell 63 percent, even as the economy more than doubled.Tightening a 75 ppb standard by just 5 ppb doesn’t seem so stringent, as emissions of precursors continue to plunge. But the chemistry of ozone formation causes ozone to be insensitive to controls. In other words, it takes a much larger percentage reductions in emissions of precursor gases, NOx and hydrocarbons, to achieve a given percentage reduction in ozone. One recent study found several U.S. cities would need NOx reductions of more than 70 percent to attain 70 ppb ozone.What makes ozone so unresponsive to emission controls? A substantial amount of ozone comes from sources that cannot be controlled: biogenic hydrocarbons and NOx, lightning, international emissions, stratospheric ozone intrusions, and so forth. WHAT WILL happen when a mandatory ozone limit collides with emissions that can't be cut enough? That problem will arise long before 2025. Cities like Houston and Dallas do not violate the new limit by a huge margin (their “design values” are each 80 ppb now), and thus are likely to be classified as “moderate” nonattainment regions. Such regions typically are given six years to meet an ozone standard. However, if 2025 is unattainable, so is a six-year deadline.What next? Regulatory conflict and litigation will likely proliferate as non-attainment continues. Furthermore, the health and agricultural benefits projected to result from 70 ppb ozone will be forestalled (though, as I'll argue in my next article, those benefits are likely to be small).This quagmire ahead arises in part from outdated provisions of the Clean Air Act. Since the Act requires EPA to consider only health in setting air quality standards, valid concerns such as feasibility and cost receive insufficient attention. That has been advantageous at times — witness the many rules attained far more affordably than industry has forewarned.But this time, affordability isn't the main concern. It's whether it's possible to attain the standards at all.In my analysis, there's simply not enough opportunity for the areas to control their smog. Houston and Dallas can't possibly hit their targets by 2025. THERE IS a better way to control air pollution in the U.S. Over a decade ago, the National Research Council outlined a better path to air quality management. They recommended more integrated approaches, looking at groups of related pollutants instead of individual ones, and with more emphasis on measurable outcomes than the process by which we reach them. I myself have suggested paths toward more integrated air quality management that consider both health benefits and control costs.The Clean Air Act, though, puts the EPA in a bind. The law requires the agency to create its standards based on health, not feasibility or affordability. And so we get the 70 ppb standard. It makes sense if health threshholds are all that is considered, but it ignores the reality of what states actually can achieve.There is a better way. But with Congress gridlocked on an update to the Clean Air Act, I expect many more years of non-attainment and litigation. Daniel Cohan is an associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University.

ANDREW GRICEHOKKAIDO, Japan -- President Bush signed off with a defiant farewell over his refusal to accept global climate change targets at his last G8 summit.As he prepared to fly out from his final G8 summit in Japan, he told his fellow leaders: "Goodbye from the world's biggest polluter."Bush made the private joke in the summit's closing session, senior sources said. His remarks were taken as a two-fingered salute from the President from Texas who is wedded to the oil industry. He had given some ground at the summit by saying he would "seriously consider" a 50 percent cut in carbon emissions by 2050.But green groups had protested that the summit was a missed opportunity to secure the radical reductions in carbon emissions that were needed to reduce global warming. China and India, who were among the emerging economies invited to attend the G8, refused to sign up to binding agreements without firmer commitments from the U.S. and the other industrialized nations to cut their CO2 emissions.However, there was progress towards a deal on the world trade talks in Geneva. On the final day of their three-day summit, the G8 countries agreed to instruct their negotiators to make every effort to secure a deal when talks resume on July 21.Although a similar call by the G8 summit two years ago failed to break the deadlock in the seven-year trade talks, officials are more confident that this month's negotiations will be successful. They say there is a growing recognition that it will be much harder to secure a deal after a new U.S. president takes office next January because of pressures to protect American farmers during this year's election campaign n and that a new global trade framework may never be struck.Bush gave his strongest support for an immediate agreement to his fellow G8 leaders. "We were looking for a signal from Bush and we got one," one British source said. "It's not in the bag but there is now a real push for a deal."The talks will involve a complicated set of trade-offs between Europe, America, Latin America and India over farming and industrial subsidies and tariffs.Brazil, a possible stumbling block to a deal, raised the prospects of a breakthrough after its president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, met British Prime Minster Gordon Brown yesterday on the margins of the summit. They issued a joint statement saying that the "window of opportunity" for an agreement is closing. They added: "The time for technical negotiations is drawing to an end. The key decisions now are political ones. We must act decisively now. If we don't, we will be failing the world's poor and destroying the best basis for continued economic growth in the future. The cost of failure is simply too great."Brazil's willingness to ease restrictions on imports of goods such as cars and chemicals from richer nations could hold the key to a successful deal if European nations accept cuts in support for their farmers in return.Brown told a press conference that a trade agreement could save the average British household (pounds sterling) 200 a year by bringing down food prices and would also bring greater benefits to the world's poorest countries, notably in Africa.He suggested that another potential obstacle to a deal -- Nicolas Sarkozy -- appeared to have been removed during the G8 meeting, when the French president rejected protectionist moves despite his criticism of Peter Mandelson, the EU's trade commissioner and negotiator in the talks.Brown described the Geneva talks as "make or break," adding: "If we fail this month to secure a trade agreement, it will not be easy to resume negotiations ... We are at one minute to midnight."The final day of the summit saw tensions over climate change between the G8 and eight other major economies invited to Japan to discuss a new global agreement. The other eight nations, including China and India, failed to sign up to the G8's pledge to cut its carbon emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050.

"Even on a good day, it's a major polluter in Houston. And it looks like there are some bad days ahead."Officials with Petrobras haven't responded to questions about how the turnaround will affect air quality.They have, however, provided some details about the turnaround, which will address several units within the refinery and draw about 1,000 contractors to the plant.The company has developed a plan to help minimize heavy vehicle traffic near the Washburn Tunnel, Petrobras officials said in a statement.Some energy analysts have said the timing seems a bit early for a typical turnaround maintenance, but that could involve needing more expensive work after a fire and explosion last March that injured one worker."The suspicion is it's not in the best of shape," said Sandy Fielden, Morningstar's director of oil and products research, describing the refinery as the Houston area's weakest performing.Seeing as how it's Petrobras' only U.S. refinery and it uses Texas oil, not Brazilian crude, it may make sense that financially struggling Petrobras could try to sell it."Maybe what they're trying to do is dress it up for a sale," Fielden said.Petrobras has owned the facility for 10 years. It has been linked to the massive corruption scandal unfolding in Brazil known as "Operation Car Wash."In July, a lightning strike caused the plant to emit 21 tons of potentially dangerous pollutants into the air and a shelter-in-place order was called for the Galena Park area. In 2011, the refinery had another fire.Last month, Environment Texas and the Sierra Club notified the plant of their intent to sue in federal court under the Clean Air Act on allegations the refinery spewed out illegal levels of particulate matter, by the hour, over the course of five years.Particulate matter is a mix of microscopic particles and liquid droplets, including acids, organic compounds, metals, soot and dust. According to federal environmental regulators, particulate matter exposure is linked to a range of serious health problems, increased emergency room and hospital visits, decreased life expectancy and aggravated asthma.The EPA has said that 75,000 people live within three miles of the plant. There are eight nearby schools, a Headstart program and several daycare centers in the surrounding area.Jordan Blum of the Houston Chronicle contributed to this report

By Joel Connelly, SeattlePICaptionCloseThe Duwamish spent decades as what industry calls "a working river," with scant regard to those living near its banks, with heavy metals and PCBs making Seattle's only river a federal Superfund cleanup site.The ethnically diverse South Park neighborhood is making itself part of the cleanup, spurred by the fact that life expectancy is eight years lower there than the citywide average, with children's asthma rates substantially higher."The river is very important to us, not just to animals but we all use it," said Guadalupe Zamora, 15, a student at Chief Sealth International High School, taking part in an Environmental Justice Youth Forum on Saturday at South Park Community Center.As for what he has learned from two months' work in the Duwamish Valley Youth Corps, Zamora reflected:  "I am finding out how to keep the water clean, the air more clean, inside my house and outside.  We plant trees, we pick up garbage, we remove graffiti. ... We talk to the mayor."A fellow student, Ashley Dinh, added:  "The 98108 zip code has the highest ranking for air pollution of any zip code in Seattle."The Youth Corps picks up trash along the river, prunes back vines intruding on trails, plants trees and helps do free indoor pollution assessments and provide air filters.While cleaning up the river's environs, the Youth Corps is trying to clean up the image of youth in the area. "Not all of us are bad kids; good things are coming off the Corps. It keeps us off the streets, and makes us concerned about the environment around us," said Shelina Lal, another Chief Sealth student.The nation's poor, and immigrant communities, have paid heavily for pollution, from the Duwamish River to New Jersey estuaries, to bayous near Louisiana refineries, to the Houston Ship Channel.The hurt is what you never hear talked about by the talking heads of cable TV news -- higher asthma rates for kids, impacts on pregnant women, higher incidence of some cancers and lower life expectancy.Incoming President-elect Donald Trump has blasted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, briefly called for its abolition, and has put the climate change skeptic who heads the Competitive Enterprise Institute in charge of EPA transition.The Trump agenda on immigration and the environment has caused worry in the South Park and Georgetown neighborhoods."There are a lot of undocumented people here, the (next) president wants to remove a lot of them.  Families get separated," said Zamora.But, said Lal, Mayor Ed Murray has reaffirmed that Seattle is a "sanctuary city.""As a colored, bisexual female, I feel unsafe," she added, "but (Murray) is making us feel safe. I think this neighborhood is fine, but we have to stick together."The feeling Saturday was that an engaged South Park will carry on, regardless of dark soundings from the "other" Washington.  Murray is as committed to the Duwamish Valley Youth Corps -- he met with its volunteers this week -- as the Corps is to him."It's not what they (distant politicians) want, it's what people want. ... We have a lot of power if we speak out," said Gregorio Chavez, a junior at Chief Sealth.  And, added fellow student Aos Salem, "People are already noticing."The Environmental Justice Youth Forum was student-run, with mini-workshops on healthy eating -- making a banana boat is a device to make good food more attractive -- and such small steps as not washing cars on the street, to keep pollutants out of the river."Do you know what a Superfund site is?  Do you know why the Duwamish River was made a Superfund site?" Zamora asked one workshop.  "What can we do to protect Seattle's only river?"The attendees learned, from young people in the community.Engaging kids in South Park served a purpose in hours of national division and acrimony.  "This is why the timing is very good, that we are together. It is way more meaningful right now, when people are fearful.  It is important we learn what we can do," said Paulina Lopez, the community engagement project manager who helps organize the Youth Corps' activities.In turn, watching the engaged kids was a morale boost for adults standing in back.

By Joel Connelly, SeattlePIOrca whales in Puget Sound have "one of the highest recorded levels" of toxic PCBs "for any on earth," says Gov. Jay Inslee. Orca whales in Puget Sound have "one of the highest recorded levels" of toxic PCBs "for any on earth," says Gov. Jay Inslee.CaptionCloseOrca whales in Puget Sound have "one of the highest recorded levels" of toxic PCBs "for any on earth," says Gov. Jay Inslee. Orca whales in Puget Sound have "one of the highest recorded levels" of toxic PCBs "for any on earth," says Gov. Jay Inslee.Washington state is suing Monsanto for damages and cleanup costs that could total hundreds of millions of dollars, over toxic PCBs that the agribusiness giant produced for decades while allegedly concealing its knowledge of the chemical's harm to human health and the environment."PCBs are in every waterway in the state," said Attorney General Bob Ferguson in announcing the suit.  He described the coolant, banned by Congress in 1979, as "one of the most pervastive pollutants in history."Gov. Jay Inslee, appearing with Ferguson, spoke of an "omnipresent and terrifically toxic material" and noted that concentrations of PCBs in the southern resident orca population are "one of the highest recorded for any place on Earth."The state's suit, filed in King County Superior Court on Thursday, is a political signal as well.With the incoming Trump administration tapping anti environmental and anti-consumer politicians for top positions -- e.g. climate skeptic Scott Pruitt at EPA -- Northeast and West Coast states are set to take the lead, particularly on environmental and climate policy.Monsanto was the only U.S. company to produce PCBs from 1935 to 1979, when Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act.  Ferguson quoted internal memos, from 1937 and 1969, to show the company's knowledge of hazards. The alleged effort to conceal dangers is cited in the state's suit, which describes PCBs as a public nuisance "that is harmful to health and obstructs the free use of public resources and state waters."PCBs are a major reason why the Duwamish River, Seattle's only river, is now an EPA Superfund cleanup site.The Environmental Protection Agency has classified PCBs as a likely human carcinogen.  Exposure to PCBs is associated with cancer as well as adverse impacts on human immune, reproductive, nervous and endocrine systems."PCB" stands for polychlorninated biphenyl, an organic chlorine compound.  Its environmental toxicity has long been recognized -- it was banned in 2001 by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants -- but it is a poison that does not go away.PCBs build up in the tissues of fish and other animals.  The state Department of Health currently has 13 fish consumption advisories related to PCBs, covering the Columbia River, all of Lake Washington, as well as 21 miles of the Wenatchee River."Monsanto is responsible for producing a chemical that is so widespread in our environment that it appears virtually everywhere we look -- in our waterways, in people and in fish -- at levels that can impact our health," said Inslee.Monsanto "needs to be held accountable," the governor added.Washington is the first state in the country to initiate litigation against Monsanto.  Seattle and Spokane have lawsuits pending against Monsanto over PCB contamination in water treatment."We expect this to be a long, complex legal fight," said Ferguson.Monsanto has resources.  It poured $4.5 million into defeating a 2013 Washington initiative that would have required labeling of genetically modified food products and seeds sold in the Evergreen State.The defendants in the lawsuit are Monsanto and two of its splinter companies, Solutia Inc. and Pharmacia LLC. Ferguson quoted a 1937 internal Monsanto document, warning of "systemic toxic effects" from lengthy exposure to PCB vapors. He charged that the company had evidence of global PCB contamination by the 1960's, but withheld information from the public."There is no practical course of action that can so effectively police the uses of these products as to prevent environmental contamination," a Monsanto committee said in a 1969 internal report."There are, however, a number of actions which must be undertaken to prolong the manufacture, sale and use of these particular Aroclors (the brand name under which PCBs were marketed.)A third smoking gun, quoted by Ferguson, was an internal report stating that "there is too much customer/market need and selfishly too much Monsanto profit to go out" to stop producing PCBs.Washington has contracted with outside legal counsel, as did then-AG Christine Gregoire in states' multibillion lawsuit against the tobacco industry.Ferguson has been a bold Attorney General.He has filed a $100 million lawsuit against Comcast over allegedly deceptive consumer proactices.  He has won a multimillion dollar judgment against the Grocery Manufacturers Association for laundering campaign contributions in the 2013 food labeling battle. He has sued the U.S. Department of Energy over the exposure of Hanford workers to vapors.  And Ferguson has established a Counsel for Environmental Protection in the Attorney General's office.Ferguson was the state's leading vote getter in the November election.

By Joel Connelly, SeattlePICaptionCloseBuildup of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere has topped 415 parts per million--the highest level in human history--according to new measurements taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, atop Mauna Loa in Hawaii.The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has climbed 45 percent since the Industrial Revolution, and levels have risen from fewer than 320 parts per million in 1960 to today's record level of 415 PPM."The last time there was this much CO2 in our atmosphere there were trees growing at the South Pole," reported Grist.Meteorologist Eric Holthaus tweeted:"This is the first time in human history our planet's atmosphere has more than 415 parts per million of CO2.RELATED: 'You're adults now and this is an actual crisis' — Bill Nye talks climate change"Not just in recorded history, not since the invention of agriculture 10,000 years ago, since before human history existed millions of years ago."Carbon dioxide is the greatest contributor to human-caused global warming. Coal, oil, natural gas and automobile engines all send CO2 into the atmosphere. Despite efforts to curb emissions, centered on the West Coast, levels continue to go up.Why? Because humans put 37 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere last year.Ralph Keeling, a professor at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, said in a statement:"The average growth rate is remaining on the high end. The increase from last year will probably be around 3 parts per million, whereas the recent average has been 2.5 parts per million."The urgency of the climate crisis has escaped the Trump Administration, witness last week's meeting of the eight-nation Arctic Council.

"One compartment sustained an 8-inch gash, spilling the 1,800 gal."The spill had also extended about 3 miles up the road because motorists had driven over the spill before I-5 was closed. All 3 miles of roadway will need to be cleaned up before the road can re-open.The driver of the tanker was uninjured in the crash, but was arrested for DUI.RELATED: Reports: Expect busy roads, ferry delays for Fourth of July week in Seattle By 8 a.m., traffic had backed up about 6 miles from the detour exit."This is going to be an ALL DAY event," Finn said in a tweet.

Dan Shapley, It had been known, but disputed, for a year that China was the new king of carbon, having pumped more of the heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere annually than the United States. Now, with a new analysis from the Netherlands, the rise of China's polluting power has been confirmed.The world's carbon dioxide emissions increased 3% in 2007, and China was responsible for fully two thirds of that increase, according to the report. It now emits 14% more than the United States every year, and that figure is expected to grow as the country continues to burn coal, clear forests and make cement to fuel its own economic boom, while manufacturing the world's disposable goods.China is now responsible for about one quarter of the world's annual carbon dioxide pollution, while the U.S. is responsible for one fifth. It takes all of Europe and India combined to approach the level of pollution the U.S. creates every year. And the U.S. still leads the world in pollution per person: It takes almost four Chinese people (and more than 10 Indians) to equal the pollution of a single American.The big picture here is, one, that greenhouse gas pollution continues to increase, despite ever clearer warnings that global warming is a real and present threat. From the Arctic, where ice is melting at an unexpected pace, to raging wildfires across the U.S. West and other extremes of weather, the warning signs are hard to miss.But finding a way not only to reduce emissions in the United States, where technological development is easier and first-world living standards are already in place, but also in China, where industrial development is a key to bringing millions out of poverty, is an open question. In the United Nations' negotiations about climate change, and in parallel discussions among the world's top polluters convened by President Bush, a key question has been how to transfer clean energy technology created by free market enterprise in the West to China, India and other nations that would otherwise follow the West's model of a decades-long high-polluting march toward modernization.So far, there hasn't been an answer found to that question. Meanwhile, the stakes are only getting higher.NCDC

By John BurgesonA coalition of eight states, including Connecticut, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to force it to control pollution from power plants in the Midwest.The other states are Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Vermont and New York, whose state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is leading the lawsuit.The suit takes issue with a Trump administration’s decision to allow nine upwind states to escape tighter smog requirements.“Connecticut has stringent air-quality laws and regulations, but Connecticut suffers from significant pollution and air-quality issues because the state is downwind of out-of-state sources of pollution,” said Jaclyn M. Severance, a spokeswoman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen.“Connecticut is a downwind state and much of our air quality is affected by the pollution produced by upwind states like Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana,” said Chris Collibee, a spokesman for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. “The sad reality is that everypower plant in the state could be forced to shut down during the summer months because of the pollution that blows in from the Midwest.”This is not the first time EPA actions — or inaction — concerned Hartford. In March, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy sent a letter to Trump’s controversial EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, blasting the agency’s preliminary decision to exempt nine states, most of which are in the Rust Belt, from tougher scrutiny of coal-fired power plants.Those states, the governor wrote, should be held accountable for their adverse impact on the air quality in the Northeast.In October 2016, six northeastern states sued the EPA to compel the agency to add nine “upwind” states to its so-called Ozone Transport Region.Those states were Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.The states already in the OTR are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. These states are required to submit plans and install a certain level of controls for pollutants that form ozone. The states outside the OTR do not have to follow those requirements.Connecticut leaders fear the Trump’s administration, under pressure from U.S. automakers, will unwind Obama-era fuel efficiency standards and caps on tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide.“Obviously, this is a guy (Pruitt) who was a sellout to fossil fuels to begin with and doesn’t mind polluting Connecticut’s air with (emissions) from Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky and Pennsylvania,” Malloy told reporters at the time.EPA officials could not be reached on Wednesday for comment.Staff writer Neil Vigdor contributed to this story. jburgeson@ctpost.com

By Mark ZaretskyA rendering of the Atlantic Wharf development to be constructed in Branford.A rendering of the Atlantic Wharf development to be constructed in Branford.CaptionCloseA rendering of the Atlantic Wharf development to be constructed in Branford.A rendering of the Atlantic Wharf development to be constructed in Branford.BRANFORD — A major, mixed-use development project to put 10 buildings with 205 residential units on the former site of Atlantic Wire is up in the air again, with a new lawsuit  the property owner has failed to do required environmental cleanup.The developer of the Atlantic Wharf project, Metro Star Capital LLC, filed the lawsuit in February, claiming damages greater than $15,000 against property owner 1 Church Street LLC.The 7.7-acre property is located along the Branford River, within walking distance to the center of town and the Shore Line East train station. The 10-building, mixed-use complex would feature 205 residential units that would be a mix of studio and one- and two-bedroom apartments, according to its zoning application.The development plan includes an underground parking garage with 195 spaces and a new road to be built through the complex near the side of the train tracks.The property has been under contract for sale since Feb. 26, 2013, and the town approved the development initially in February 2015 and again in January 2017.The developer agreed to buy it for $6 million, according to the lawsuit, first reported by the Branford Seven news site.The agreement “expressly obligates defendant to develop a remediation plan ... subject to approval by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection” and “then complete the work ... prior to the closing,” the lawsuit says.The remediation plan, or RAP, was due by May 12, 2013, 75 days after the purchase agreement was executed. The lawsuit says 1 Church Street “provided an informal ‘Remedial Approach’ document’ on June 17, 2013 “that did not satisfy its RAP obligations.”It alleges that “the closing has been held up because defendant is unwilling to expend the money necessary to properly remediate the property,” and that 1 Church Street “has failed to develop and fair and workable (remedial action plan) and has failed to conduct the required remediation.”As a result “Metro Star is incurring present and future losses due to defendant’s wrongful and unfair delay,” the lawsuit says.It says the delay “is jeopardizing Metro Star’s ability to complete the project given that construction is expected to take three years, and the zoning approvals are set to expire in April 2022.”In addition, “defendant has engaged in unreasonable and imprudent demolition activities that have complicated the remediation issue and damaged the property that is to be conveyed,” the lawsuit states.Among them, “defendant has caused additional harm by demolishing structures on the property without proper environmental management,” the suit says.Metro Star Capital and its CEO Robert Smith Jr. are represented by David Slossberg and Jeffrey Nichols of Hurwitz, Sagarin, Slossberg & Knuff of Milford; 1 Church Street and owner Kevin O’Neill are represented by Gerald Giaimo of Halloran & Sage of New Haven.“I look forward to disproving the allegations in court,” Giaimo said Thursday.There are actually three parcels involved, including 5.19 acres at 1 Church St., 1.19 acres at 256 Meadow St. and 1.27 acres described as Meadow Street Rear.The property previously had been classified under the Transfer Act as an “establishment” where processes involving hazardous wastes took place, the lawsuit says.DEEP advised 1 Church Street in April 2017 “the RAP must include a liner under the underground parking garage that is included in Metro Star’s project design” to contain contaminated soils benath the site of the old Atlantic Wire Mill, the suit says.But 1 Church Street “proposed to install the liner either under the footings of the parking garage or in between the footing and the slab in order to make remediation cheaper for the defendent,” it says.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved the plan in early 2018.Atlantic Wire manufactured industrial wire for 102 years. The company declared bankruptcy in 2008 and was charged with federal crimes and state violations for polluting the Branford River.After Atlantic Wire officials pleaded guilty to the criminal charges, the owners began an extensive cleanup of the site as part of a deal with the state. A former vice president of Atlantic Wire was sentenced in 2009 to a year of probation for violating clean water regulations by failing to report toxic discharges into the Branford River.Atlantic Wire LLC paid the state $1.5 million to settle allegations it repeatedly dumped toxic waste water into the Branford River between 2005 and early 2008.mark.zaretsky@hearstmediact.com

By Emilie MunsonA recent photo of West Branch Farmington River, Connecticut.A recent photo of West Branch Farmington River, Connecticut.CaptionCloseA recent photo of West Branch Farmington River, Connecticut.A recent photo of West Branch Farmington River, Connecticut.WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation Friday that would require the cleanup of pervasive chemical pollutants, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), that have the contaminated drinking water and soil of many communities around the country, as well as the blood of millions of Americans.In the Connecticut area, PFAS contamination has been identified at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn. and Westchester County Airport in White Plains, N.Y., as well as Stone’s Ranch Military Reservation in East Lyme, Conn., due to the use of firefighting foams at those sites, according to the nonprofit Environmental Working Group that maps PFAS contamination nationwide. But it could be present in other parts of the state as well because limited testing has been conducted.All five Connecticut House members voted in favor of the legislation passed Friday. If it becomes law, the bill would limit future releases of PFAS into the environment, spur heath studies of the chemical group, establish a drinking water standard and spark testing and monitoring for the substance around the nation. It also included a measure to notify communities about releases of the chemical and allocate grant money to help states and towns remediate the pollution.“The science is indisputable: PFAS are a massive health and ecological threat for Connecticut families,” said U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5. “As such, the law should reflect this reality. Continuing to allow a forever chemical to proliferate throughout our environment is indefensible.”The House approved the bill 247 to 159, with 24 Republicans siding with Democrats to vote in favor. One Democrat sided with most Republicans against the bill.Although the legislation passed with bipartisan support, it faces an uncertain route to passage in the Senate after some Republicans opposed the inclusion of similar PFAS measures in other legislation that became law in December. But some PFAS testing measures and funding did win approval in a defense bill and spending package that Trump signed in 2019.Some Republicans worried that the legislation was too broad in its regulation of a group of chemicals or would negatively impact businesses."We cannot classify an entire [of chemicals] as hazardous, when in facts there are only some bad actors," said U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz.PFAS are a family of chemicals that are present in numerous consumer products like non-stick pans, food packaging, Gore-Tex clothing, fire retardants, water repellents and firefighting foams.“You know those little brown boxes you take your food home in these days, you look at the inside and how shiny it is — that’s PFAS,” said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3, chatting with U.S. Rep. Paul Tonko, D-N.Y., one of the lead architects of the bill after Friday’s vote. “It’s a food safety issue.”DeLauro has called for a ban of PFAS in food packaging.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said exposure to PFAS can lower pregnancy rates, interfere with human body hormones, increase cholesterol levels, affect immune systems, and increase risks of cancer. Studies have also connected these chemicals to thyroid diseases and birth defects. The so-called 'forever chemicals' do not break down easily in the environment and can accumulate in the bloodstream with exposure.From consumer products, industrial waste and firefighting, PFAS chemicals have been introduced into the air and waterways, producing known contamination at least 43 states, although many states and communities have not yet conducted comprehensive testing for the substances.Critically, this bill requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to list some PFAS chemicals as “hazardous” and designation areas contaminated by them as “superfund” sites. This designation will make the entities responsible for exposing communities to the chemicals liable for cleanup costs.In 2019, tens of thousands of gallons of PFAS-containing firefighting foam spilled from Bradley International Airport into the Farmington River. Subsequent tests found the PFAS contamination level in fish from the river to be above 10,000 parts per trillion. The EPA recommends a maximum safety standard of 70 parts per trillion.To date, the EPA has not set binding standards on what level of PFAS presence renders water unsafe to drink, although it promised to make a determination on issuing a maximum contamination level in 2019. U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1, slammed the EPA for dragging its feet on regulation.“For decades, scientists have warned that PFAS chemicals like PFOA and PFOS can harm our health, but the EPA has been too slow to react,” Larson said. “This bill forces the EPA to take the threat posed by these chemical seriously.”Gov. Ned Lamont has convened a state working group to study PFAs contamination and recommend state action.In Dec. 2019, Congress approved legislation that required public drinking water systems be tested for PFAS, force the EPA to gather information about where PFAS contamination is and reduce the use of PFAS-containing substances, like firefighting foam and ready-made meals, at military bases.It also allocated several million dollars to help the EPA research and write a maximum contaminant limit and $350 million for cleaning up contamination across the country.These steps represent some of the strongest strides toward addressing contamination from the persistent pollutant in roughly a decade.emilie.munson@hearstdc.com; Twitter: @emiliemunson

Joan Hartley chairs the first meeting of the Transfer Act Working Group.CaptionCloseSen. Joan Hartley chairs the first meeting of the Transfer Act Working Group.Sen. Joan Hartley chairs the first meeting of the Transfer Act Working Group.HARTFORD — A working group of individuals from the business, real estate, legislative, and environmental communities met for the first time Thursday to figure out how to get hundreds of Connecticut properties back on the tax rolls.In a small room at the Legislative Office Building, Sen. Joan Hartley, D-Waterbury, sought to define the task at hand and divide the group into subcommittees. They have until Feb. 1, 2020, to make recommendations to the legislature.Their task is to clarify the Connecticut Property Transfer Act, which was adopted in 1985 to encourage the clean-up of environmentally challenged properties. However, in its current form, the legislation is impeding economic growth and has produced none of the desired environmental outcomes.The bill includes 28 exemptions to a process that is designed to require prospective property owners to verify that a given property has been cleaned up and is ready for redevelopment. The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) has to verify the findings of a licensed environmental professional that cleanup standards have been met for a given property before a developer can begin using it.The DEEP, however, has only two employees assigned to the task of verifying property transfers under the act, which limits them to processing about 78 properties a year.“We all want a clean environment, as clean as it can be, but that’s the stakes here,” Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, said. “Fixing this means a lot to the state of Connecticut.”Unlike brownfields, where generations of industrial waste have been dumped, Transfer Act properties have histories of lower-level pollution. Sales of Transfer Act sites can be held up over as little as a few dozen gallons of pesticides, one-time disposal of waste paint or ink, or contamination from chemicals used for dry cleaning or furniture stripping materials during any one-month period over the last 30 years.There have been around 470 Transfer Act filings with the DEEP over the past five years and a total of 7,200 filings since the Transfer Act was adopted 34 years ago. The properties are spread across 158 of Connecticut’s 169 municipalities.There have also been legal disputes over whether a property falls under the Transfer Act. Some disputes have dragged on long enough to convince buyers to walk away from purchases, leaving the properties fallow for years.The economic impact is huge.According to the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, the businesses represented in the filings — had their transfer requests been completed and verified — would have generated $178 million in tax revenues for the state and local governments in 2019.Connecticut and New Jersey are the only two states with a Transfer Act.“I’m not sure this uniqueness actually gets to the point of what we want to achieve in the state of Connecticut, which is economic growth,” Needleman said.Hartley said the group’s goal is also to modernize the Transfer Act. Since the statute was overhauled in 1995, “banks underwrite differently, technology is different.”Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, said, “people are triggering the Transfer Act that don’t necessarily need to be in it. It is hampering business so we need to address it.”Elizabeth Barton, an attorney with Day Pitney who is a member of the working group, said that just because a property doesn’t fall under the Transfer Act doesn’t mean it’s not being looked at for environmental issues.Needleman said DEEP may want to clean up “every ounce of dirt” in the state of Connecticut, “but that’s just not going to happen. We have been an industrial state for 150 years and we have a lot of properties.”Needleman wants to scrap the current Transfer Act and start building a program from scratch.Others argued that wasn’t the charge of the working group and they should work to change the statute that already exists.The next meeting of the working group will be around mid-September.

Tens of thousands of gallons of the foam entered the Farmington River in Windsor through sewer systems, prompting warnings from state agencies about using the water.State officials at the meeting at the Department of Transportation headquarters in Newington presented an alarming look at the work ahead to reduce risks to residents, drinking water, and the environment.“This is an emerging contaminant, these are chemicals that have been in use since the 1940s. The science and the toxicology that is giving us insight into the impacts of these chemicals on human health — that’s really what’s new and emerging over the last few years,” said Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes. “Helping to understand where this is, but also understand the degree of risk to human populations depending on how they’ve been exposed to the chemical and through what medium is an important part of our work.”Department of Public Health Epidemiologist Meg Harvey said PFAS have been linked to higher cholesterol levels, decreased immune response, slower growth and learning, behavioral effects, and increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer.“Unfortunately they are ubiquitous in our environment. We also learned that they resist degradation in the environment and they accumulate in our bodies, so it shouldn’t be surprising that studies done across the world ... have found that PFAS is in the blood of nearly every person that has been tested,” Harvey said.Gov. Ned Lamont established the task force July 8, appointing the commissioners of DEEP and DPH to lead the group. Lamont requested its report by Oct. 1.“With the current absence of federal regulations governing the exposure, use and disposal of PFAS, the burden is on individual states to take measures to educate their residents about the risks associated with exposure to PFAS and to implement appropriate safeguards. As such, the Connecticut departments of Public Health (DPH) and Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) have begun to lay the groundwork for a state action plan that will require input and assistance from your Department,” Lamont wrote in a letter to state agencies.The task force began by forming subcommittees to study health, prevention and remediation. Meetings have been scheduled for Aug. 28 and Sept. 18. More information is available at www.ct.gov/ctpfastaskforce.There are more than 4,500 substances classified as PFAS, and they are used in a staggering number of consumer and industrial products. Fabric softener, pizza boxes, cosmetics, water-resistant clothing, adhesives, non-stick cookware, and food packaging were just a few of the products listed by Shannon Pociu, an environmental analyst at DEEP.“They do have good uses, it’s just when they get spilled into the environment it’s problematic,” Pociu said.Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF), a PFAS chemical used in fire suppression, has gotten much of the attention recently because of the June spill at Bradley, but Connecticut Airport Authority Executive Director Kevin Dillon said the Federal Aviation Administration requires airports to use the chemical and has not named any alternatives.He said the CAA, which operates Bradley and five other airports, has 17 buildings containing PFAS foam systems. Some of them have containment systems, and the agency has been pursuing containment methods at the rest of them, he said.“We are required to have foam systems, that’s the state building code that requires that,” Dillon said. “We’re also required under state fire codes to keep the drains under those buildings open, so you have these conflicting issues, certainly conflicting with the environmental concerns that exist over these foams.”“At the end of the day what we’re really looking for in the aviation industry is a recommendation to come out as to what is the best environmentally-friendly foam so we can start working with tenants at the airport to see what’s involved in getting them to convert their systems,” Dillon said.Firefighting foam is also responsible for contamination of a private well near a regional training center in Willimantic. State officials said a home was connected to the public water supply on Monday after PFAS were discovered in its well water.Part of the task force goal is to identify potential sites of PFAS contamination, starting with places where AFFF has been used and including industrial sites with uses known to include PFAS in production. Landfills are also a potential source of contamination.Dykes and DPH Commissioner Renée Coleman-Mitchell said it’s up to the individual states to regulate PFAS because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not have any regulations in place. The EPA does have an action plan adopted in February to “help provide the necessary tools to assist states, tribes, and communities in addressing PFAS,” according to EPA materials.Several people who attended the task force meeting Tuesday were critical of the state’s communication in the days and weeks following the Windsor leak.Surrounding states also have been dealing with PFAS problems, where releases into the air from smokestacks have been found to contaminate soil and water. In Maine, a dairy farm’s use of bio-waste as fertilizer led to high PFAS levels in the cows’ milk, said Ray Frigon, assistant director of DEEP’s remediation division.“It’s pretty astonishing how PFAS can be so mobile in the environment,” said Frigon, who added that the rest of the northeastern states have “heartbreaking” stories to share while Connecticut has been “pretty darn lucky.”
