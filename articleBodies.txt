 The Midland Daily News This column will be a little different than the usual approach that I take. I read an interesting commentary about an interview taken from Medcape Family Medicine, July 14, 2016, with Robert D. Brook, MD, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Michigan and Director of the Hypertension Center there. Dr. Brook is from Michigan and does research on the effects of air pollution. He said he was sitting on the beach in the late 1990s with his brother who is an atmospheric scientist. Dr. Brook thought the haze he saw on the horizon, while looking over Lake Michigan, was “sea haze.” His brother explained to him, however, that it was pollution causing the foggy atmosphere. It piqued Dr. Brook’s interest and so began his lifelong research into the effects of pollution on healthcare. As with most of us, Dr. Brook thought the major problem with air pollution was that it caused lung problems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other issues like these. Research has shown, however, that the majority of health effects from air pollution are adverse cardiovascular events. This includes heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and sudden death. Air pollution is the ninth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Air pollution in defined in terms of fine PM. A PM 2.5 means particles that are less than 2.5 µm in diameter. They result from fossil fuel combustion (coal, gas, etc.), mobile sources such as traffic, or the energy industry in the modern world. The PM for a particular size is then measured in weight/m3. In the United States, the average PM 2.5 is about 10 µg/m3. In comparison, PM levels in a smoky bar are about 500 µg/m3. A little bit confusing but just compare the numbers while reading below. For the last few years, the United States has gone down from levels of 25 to 30 µg/m3 in the 1970s and 1980s to an average level of 10 µg/m3 now. This dramatic reduction has translated into an improvement in all-cause mortality leading to a six- to seven-month increase in life expectancy on average in the United States. (I thought that was pretty impressive!) However, close to 25 percent of Americans are still exposed to levels above the World Health Organization standards of 10µg/m3. Many such areas are next to roadways or in urban industrial locations. People in Asia, particularly China and India, are exposed to far higher levels of pollution than we now are. These are also the areas where cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are escalating dramatically. It is interesting to note that second-hand smoke levels are around 500 µg/m3. One cigarette delivers well over 5000 to 10,000 µg/m3. One cigarette is comparable to a month’s worth of exposure to air pollution in Beijing, China! So how does air pollution trigger the cardiovascular/heart problems? Extensive research has shown different ways. Pollutants injure the lining of the blood vessels, they cause the blood vessels to constrict and narrow, and the platelets in the blood which are involved in clotting become more sensitized and clot more easily. This all leads to more clots in the vessels (strokes and heart attacks) and arrhythmias in the heart (sudden death). (I’m simplifying this significantly!) Then the next question is: How do the pollutants do these things? For those of you who have read this column regularly, you have learned that it appears that inflammation is the first step in the cascade of events that cause strokes, heart attacks, cancer and dementia. Reduce inflammation and you reduce all of these major killers. It turns out that when the lung inhales pollution particles, the lung tissue becomes inflamed. The inflammation isn’t just isolated to the lungs, but rather inflammatory chemicals throughout the body are increased. Subsequently, the inflammation causes vascular and cardiovascular tissue to be inflamed, causing constricting of the vessels, as well as the clotting and buildup of atheroscleratic plaques. Interesting! Inflammation is the culprit once again. Many of us have heard about inflammation around the gums (gingivitis) causing heart disease. It’s part of the same story. Gingivitis causes significant inflammation which generalizes throughout the body. It is the chemicals that cause inflammation that lead to the major problems of strokes, heart attacks, cancer, and dementia. A second way that air pollution leads to heart problems is that the lung can sense these foreign particles and promote rapid changes in the body’s chemistry. It’s sort of the “flight or fight” response. Our body surges with various hormonal chemicals when it feels “attacked” and that leads to an increase in blood pressure, constriction of blood vessels, and heart arrhythmias. The final way that the pollution affects the heart and blood vessels is that the very chemicals causing the pollution are toxic in themselves. Those chemicals are absorbed through the lungs and have a direct effect on various body tissues. There are thousands of very fine particles of organic chemicals and metals in pollution. Cigarette smoke is a convenient way to deliver nicotine into the body, but the air we breathe delivers many of those other chemicals also. If scientists can detect these bodily responses to short term exposures to pollutants, imagine what happens over the long term. Think of the adverse effects on the body’s systems. We must remember that pollution is not the only factor causing heart and lung problems. Diet, obesity and exercise all play a role. But when you add on pollution, the effects multiply. One final thing in the interview was discussion of the mask that you see many Asians wearing when they are in the major cities. Do they filter out pollution? Mostly the masks being worn are simple surgical masks that protect people from respiratory droplets. They aren’t made to protect us from the fine particles in air. China and the rest of Asia are often exposed to PM levels between 100 to 500 µg/m3 (10 to 50 times what the average level is in the United States). There is some evidence showing that home air filters or purifications systems with HEPA filters do reduce exposures and lead to improved health. Research is ongoing. So, as I noted, this is a little different approach to my usual column, but rather interesting stuff, isn’t it? Dr. John L. Pfenninger’s column appears on Sundays. His office, Medical Procedures Center, is located in Midland.

 By EMERY P. DALESIO RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina judge said Friday he wants to review a surprise deal settling decades of groundwater pollution at Duke Energy's coal ash pits because he questioned the motives behind the company's deal with state environmental regulators. The deal reduced the $25 million fine at a Wilmington power plant that state regulators had promoted as the largest penalty for environmental damage in state history. The agreement cut the fine to $7 million but also sought to resolve groundwater pollution claims at all 14 of the company's power plants storing toxic coal ash, not just one. The judge who signed off on the settlement last fall went too far with his order that seemed to close lawsuits involving conservation groups, Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway said. "It is a bit surprising that in a penalty case over one plant, it developed into as comprehensive a settlement as this," Ridgeway said. The Department of Environmental Quality could decide the appropriate fine for Duke Energy polluting the groundwater at its Sutton power plant, Ridgeway said. But because Administrative Law Judge Phil Berger Jr. wasn't asked to rewrite the scope of his order approving the deal, Ridgeway said he suspected the settlement's language was designed to close the courtroom door to environmental groups or others. "I have to suspect that there is some ulterior motive," he said. The parties later agreed to ask Berger to revise his order, Duke Energy spokeswoman Erin Culbert said. Berger is the son of state Senate leader Phil Berger. The Republican's district includes Eden, site of a 2014 spill of toxic coal ash that prompted a new law requiring Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash holding pits by 2029. State water quality officials knew for years about the contamination at Sutton's unlined ash pits but took no enforcement action until August 2013 — after a citizens groups tried to sue Duke Energy. Monitoring wells near Duke's dumps at Sutton showed readings exceeding state groundwater standards for chemicals including boron and thallium, which was used in rat poison until it was banned because it is highly toxic. The hearing came on the day DEQ signed off for the first time on plans to drain the water off the top of basins where coal ash is collected, a needed step to closing, excavating or covering them. The state permit for work at Duke Energy's Riverbend power plant in Mount Holly is intended to be a model for documents needed to close coal ash pits around the state. It allows water to be diverted to rivers and streams until 3 feet of water remains above the ash. Duke Energy will be required to test fish near the discharge site to see whether their bodies contain collected mercury or lead, and twice a year test the waterway for those heavy metals and arsenic, chromium and cadmium. ___ Follow Emery P.

 Breaking News: Missing children located near North Branch By oht_editor | on August 11, 2019 REP. PAUL MITCHELL Editor’s note: Congressman Paul Mitchell, R-Dryden Township recently sent the letter below to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer regarding a proposed gravel mine on the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property in Metamora Township, which is adjacent to the Metamora Landfill Superfund site. Mitchell represents the 10th Congressional District that includes Lapeer County. Dear Gov. Whitmer, I write to express serious concerns about a proposed gravel mine on the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property in Metamora Township. This property is adjacent to the Metamora Landfill Superfund site (“site”) and the impacts this project could have on the local community and groundwater are severe. This issue was initially brought to my attention by my constituents and local stakeholders. At issue is the status of monitoring wells that track the extent and movement of contaminated groundwater emanating from the site, which is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Through multiple discussions and letters expressing these concerns to the EPA, I learned that the responsible parties had not fully complied with a July 2015 order to expand the monitoring wells around the landfill. It is troubling there is not yet a complete monitoring well network in place, especially when there is a proposed development nearby that is likely to heavily use groundwater. On July 16, 2019, after receiving my letters and listening to community concerns, the EPA directed the responsible parties to further revise the Investigation Work Plan to require a more comprehensive strategy to determine the extent of contamination from the landfill and where it is going. That work is still in progress. The EPA continues to address the contamination emanating from the federally regulated site. As they do so, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) must ensure they strictly monitor and study any proposed projects — such as the one at the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property — thoroughly and impartially. The EPA notes in their letter that EGLE would be the primary agency responsible for oversight of large quantity water withdrawals related to mining projects. The EPA has pledged to communicate with EGLE directly about the site, but I also encourage your office to be receptive to our constituents’ concerns about the proposed mine and its impacts. In addition to environmental issues related to the Superfund site, I also want to note my concern and dismay about the influence state-level lobbyists have exerted over state agencies on matters related to gravel mines. As you are surely aware, proponents of opening additional gravel mines in the state through preemption of local control are using a study produced by the Michigan Dept. of Transportation (MDOT) to advance their position. While there is a case to be made for gravel mine development at a general level, any related decisions should be made objectively, openly, and fairly, with feedback and input from all involved parties. That does not seem to be the case with the study in question. Recent media reports revealed evidence that gravel industry lobbyists made substantial and substantive efforts to direct the MDOT staff working on that taxpayer funded study toward the preferred conclusion of mining proponents. The new MDOT Director Paul Ajegba — whom you appointed — rightfully called for an audit of the contracting practices used for that study. As you work to meet the state’s infrastructure needs, I encourage your administration to maintain the principles of local control, impartial governance, and sound science. I look forward to working with your office, EGLE, and other state and federal agencies to ensure that any developments around the Metamora Landfill Superfund site do not endanger human health or pollute our groundwater. For ease of reference, enclosed please find my correspondence to and from the EPA. I encourage you and your Administration to review these materials and listen to all feedback on this issue. Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter.

url: https://www.lakecountystar.com/news/article/Wisconsin-Assembly-passes-bill-to-combat-PFAS-15072980.php
 Todd Richmond, Associated Press MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin Assembly Republicans hastily put together a bill addressing PFAS contamination and pushed it through to the Senate early Friday, just moments before adjourning for the year. The bill gives Rep. John Nygren of Marinette cover on the campaign trail this summer. His northeastern Wisconsin district has been hit hard by PFAS groundwater pollution. PFAS are man-made chemicals that research suggests can decrease female fertility, increase the risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women and lower birth weights. The chemicals have been used for decades in a range of products, including firefighting foam, nonstick cookware, fast-food wrappers and stain-resistant sprays. Nygren and Democratic state Sen. Dave Hansen of Green Bay put together a sweeping bill addressing PFAS contamination in January that called for emergency rules limiting the amount of PFAS in ground and surface water as well as air emissions, grants for municipalities to address PFAS pollution, sampling wildlife for contamination and free blood testing for people living near polluted areas in Marinette, Peshtigo and Porterfield. The measure sputtered out amid pushback from powerful business groups, including Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the Wisconsin Dairy Alliance and the Wisconsin Paper Council. Nygren said on the Assembly floor Friday morning that the bill's opponents used “scare tactics” to frighten people into thinking the proposal would cost jobs. He also said it was difficult to gather legislative support for the bill since PFAS contamination is more of a local problem than a statewide issue. Still, he convinced his fellow Republicans during a break in debate on other bills to let him amend a measure setting bidding requirements for lake rehabilitation projects to address PFAS. The amendment would require a new University of Wisconsin System freshwater collaborative to study PFAS pollution and report back to the Legislature by Jan. 1. The Assembly passed a bill earlier this week laying out funding for the collaborative. That measure is now in the Senate. The Department of Natural Resources would have to develop emergency rules for certifying laboratories to test for the presence of PFAS; test for PFAS in municipal water systems and private wells near contaminated sites and provide clean drinking water for people in those areas; and request whatever money it needs to address PFAS in the next state budget. Nygren acknowledged the amendment doesn't go nearly as far as the bill that he and Hansen crafted but said, “I don't want to walk away from this opportunity without providing some answers ... and some certainty for my constituents.” Democrats lobbied Republicans to pass the original bill to no avail. In the end, the chamber approved the amendment on a voice vote. They passed the bill on a 62-35 party line vote moments before Republican leaders ended the floor period and with it the Assembly's work for the year. The bill's prospects in the Senate are unclear.Alec Zimmerman, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, had no immediate comment on the bill's chances. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers earlier this month signed another Nygren PFAS bill that prohibits the use of firefighting foam except in emergencies and in training facilities with state-approved containment measures. ___ Follow Todd Richmond on Twitter at https://twitter.com/trichmond1

 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Actorand activist Mark Ruffalohas visited North Carolinato push for policies to eliminate chemical pollution from industrial products, like those discharged into the Cape Fear River for years. Ruffalo spoke on Wednesdayat a Legislative Building news conference in Raleigh to highlight the challenges of communities affected by what are known as PFAS, or "forever chemicals." These compounds include GenX, which is used in producing non-stick surfaces. Little research exists about the health effects of chemicals like GenX, which has been used at the Chemours Co. plant near Fayetteville. The event was sponsored by the North Carolina Conservation Network, Clean Cape Fear and the Center for Environmental Health.State legislators and residents also spoke. Ruffalo is known for his roles in the "Avengers" movies, "Thanks for Sharing" and others. He also recently played an environmental defense attorney in “Dark Waters.”Ruffalo participated in an event in Wilmington on Tuesday evening that included a screening of “Dark Waters.” He also spent some time with Attorney General Josh Stein earlier Wednesday.

 By Chevall Pryce A group of local stakeholders continues working to identify, measure and mitigate direct causes of water pollution in Cypress Creek. The Cypress Creek Watershed Partnership whose members include local government figures, business owners and residents, began hosting public meetings earlier this year to spread the partnership’s message and form a steering committee. The 11-member committee is overseeing the creation of a watershed protection plan, or WPP, to reduce the amount of water pollution within Cypress Creek. Related: Community-led committee to work on fixing Cypress Creek water quality On Nov. 14 and 19, the CCWP hosted work group meetings to discuss possible direct causes for water pollution and brainstorm ideas for measuring those causes. According to data already collected by the CCWP, fecal waste from pets — specifically pet dogs — accounts for approximately 80 percent of the bacteria in the creek. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Houston-Galveston Area Council are facilitating the partnership’s strategy development process with help from a grant provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Justin Bower, senior planner with H-GAC, led the meetings, which he said are meant to gather recommendations and information for the partnership before the steering committee approves recommendations for the next phase of reducing waste in the watershed. Human waste During the Nov. 14 work group meeting at Barbara Bush Library, Bower met with interested community members and local stakeholders to discuss human-related sources, including pet waste. The partnership website states that certain sections of the watershed’s waterways have levels of fecal contaminants exceeding Texas’ limit for recreational use. The fecal contamination comes from a variety of sources, including human wastewater and animals, according to the website. Bower said human waste is more likely to get humans sick than animal waste or other sources. Related: Fecal matter in Cypress Creek prompts watershed protection plan Attendees suggested better educating other community members about the dangers of exposure to stormwater due to pollution, more frequent unannounced testing of wastewater treatment plants, and reinforcing the importance of picking up waste from pets. Part of the issue is knowing generally what kind of waste is coming in-stream, but not being able to pinpoint where exactly the sources of pollution are the worst. For instance, data collected at wastewater treatment plants is being accounted for in the WPP, but the exact levels of pollution along the waterway are not specified. “We recommend looking for resources to do additional in-stream targeted sampling,” Bower said. “Let’s say we have an issue with one tributary. Do some targeted sampling up and down there so we can start to say, ‘It’s good here, it’s good here, what’s in between those.’” Bower said when contaminant sources are found, then the CCWP can work with Harris County and the TCEQ to address those sources contributing to water quality issues. Bower said the CCWP is speaking with apartment complexes and neighborhoods to get a better sense of how many people pick up their pet waste and if they have the resources available to do so, such as pet waste disposal stations. The information gathered may result in a lower documented percentage of waste from pets than was previously thought. “We just assumed when we populated dog numbers that those dogs are producing waste that is making it to the stream, which isn’t necessarily the case,” he said. “We’ll find a conservative estimate to reduce that number by to reflect ownership.” Livestock and wildlife waste While livestock waste, including cows, horses, goats, sheep and pigs, may not be the largest contributor to the pollution of Cypress Creek, Bower said it is still an issue for the partnership to address during the work group meeting about agriculture, wildlife and invasive species’ impact on water quality Nov. 18 at the Weekley Community Center. Currently the CCWP is looking for more direct measurement of livestock populations near the waterways to determine the actual impact and significance of their waste. Bower said the CCWP is already aware they need to reduce their previously measured impact of animal waste on Cypress Creek downstream. “When we looked at the numbers initially, we had about 10 percent of the total amount of watershed coming from cattle or livestock,” he said. “Unsurprisingly most of them are out on the prairie or west of (SH)99. We looked at the cattle numbers versus the stocking rates that some of the district board members suggested ... and our numbers were actually pretty close.” Mary Anne Piacentini, executive director of the Katy Prairie Conservancy, said the conservancy is working to keep cattle from polluting the waterways. “On Warren Ranch all of our streams now are fenced off so the cattle are not getting into our streams,” she said. “So, you’ve got 600 cattle that aren’t getting to the stream that way. The hope is that we’re going to be able to do more of that on our other properties if we get to convert all of our herds.” Just like with other sources, the closer the source is to the stream, within a buffer that the CCWP has determined, the more impact their waste will have on the waterway. Bower said waste from agriculture is not necessarily the main issue, but it still needs to be stopped and people need to be warned to avoid contact with the water if possible. As for species like feral hogs and deer, sparse data is present for either group right now. Feral hogs can be a problem for the watershed due to their high reproductive rates, tendency to destroy vegetation and destabilize streams, along with their waste, Bower said. Bower said feral hog concentrations are higher in the western portion of Harris County with less development. “The largest percent (of waste feral hogs produce) in any of the watershed is about 4 percent before we move the numbers so they’re going to be probably about 6 or 7 (percent) in the western most part,” he said. Deer waste contribution data is also sparse but needs measurement. Bower said data is needed for all other wildlife, but probably won’t be a major consideration unless they have a large impact in larger numbers. For instance, birds are not perceived as having as large of an impact as other sources. What now? The CCWP will host a public meeting Nov. 21 to provide information on past meetings and receive more feedback and suggestions for the WPP. Information about the partnership and future efforts can be found at https://cypresspartnership.weebly.com/. Bower suggested citizens do all they can to prevent waste from polluting waterways by attending CCWP meetings and doing their part within their daily life. “We’re not talking about the old days of the smoke stack coming out of the factory, we’re talking about the cumulative impact of everything everyone’s doing,” he said. “Walk your dog? Pick it up. It’s better than drinking it.” chevall.pryce@chron.com

 By Sergio Chapa A petrochemical plant located about 120 miles southwest of Houston has entered into $50 million settlement in a lawsuit over polluting Lavaca Bay with plastic pellets. Formosa Plastics Corp., San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and Calhoun County resident Diane Wilson reached the settlement on Tuesday, according to a U.S. District Court filing in Victoria. Company officials reported that the $50 million would go to the newly formed Matagorda Bay Mitigation Trust to promote environmental sustainability in the region. Some of those projects include working with the Matagorda Bay Fishing Cooperative to restore marine ecosystems, environmental restoration work Green Lake Park in Calhoun County, YMCA youth camps, beach restoration and funding the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve's "Nurdle Patrol" to find and remove plastic pellets known as nurdles along area waterways. “The conditions agreed to in this settlement demonstrate Formosa’s commitment to manufacturing our products in a safe and environmentally friendly manner,” Formosa Plastics Corp. USA Executive Vice President Ken Mounger said in a statement. “We will continue to partner with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that FPC USA environmental programs are at the top of our industry.” Downstream: Judge finds Formosa liable for plastic pollution at Texas plant In a statement, Wilson called the settlement a victory for the environment. “The years of fighting to protect the natural resources of the Lavaca Bay-Cox Creek area have finally paid off,” Wilson said. “It’s a huge victory for the environment – and for the people who love and depend upon it. We look forward to working with Formosa to restore the health of our environment and make sure it stays pristine.” Texas RioGrande Legal Aid sued Formosa in July 2017 on behalf Wilson and her group, the San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper. The suit alleged Formosa had polluted waterways near its Point Comfort plant for nearly three decades. Wilson, a Calhoun County native and former shrimper, had fought Formosa since the early 1990s. Employing more than 1,900 employees and 795 contractors, the Point Comfort plant produces resins for plastics such as high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). “A settlement of this size sends a powerful message to corporate polluters – there’s a steep price to pay for flagrant, chronic violations of laws that protect our environment,” Texas RioGrande Legal Aid attorney Erin Gaines said in a statement. “And with plastics pollution of our oceans at a crisis, the message comes at a vital time.” Fuel Fix: Get daily energy news headlines in your inbox Founded in 1954 and headquartered in Taiwan, Formosa was ranked as one of the world's largest chemical companies. Formosa's U.S. headquarters is in New Jersey. Company officials previously said that they have installed multiple screening and control systems to control pollution. The company has said it has the plant has 16 full-time contract employees whose main job is to clean up debris and pellets outside the plant.

 Dan Freedman Caption Close Washington Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Wednesday will introduce legislation to force the Environmental Protection Agency to set maximum levels for the class of chemicals involved in drinking-water contamination in Hoosick Falls and other sites in New York. The measure would require the EPA to set maximum levels for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS for short. The EPA would have two years to do it. In February, the EPA issued what its top official termed an "all-encompassing plan" on PFAS but sidestepped setting maximum levels. The agency, which under President Donald Trump has been in the forefront of rolling back pollution regulations, promised to look into setting new levels. Currently there is no maximum established for PFAS, but the EPA has established a health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) in drinking water. Gillibrand's bill, co-authored with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., reflects the skepticism of health and environmental advocates who say they doubt the EPA will buck the chemical industry's lobbyists. "It is the EPA's job to protect Americans from highly toxic chemicals like PFAS, but they have failed to do what is necessary to help ensure our families in New York and across the country are no longer exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS in their drinking water," Gillibrand said in a statement. "This is a widespread crisis that is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk." Gillibrand has been alternating periods of legislative activity on Capitol Hill with appearances on the campaign trail in her bid to become the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. Toxic levels of a variety of PFAS were found in the drinking water in Hoosick Falls in 2014, the result of filtration from a nearby plant producing chemicals for nonstick plastics in cookware and other products. The levels discovered in Hoosick Falls in 2014 ranged from 180 ppt to 540 ppt. Health and environmental experts and advocates say the advisory level of 70 ppt is too high. In December, the New York Drinking Water Quality Council recommended a "maximum contaminant level" of 10 parts per billion for the two PFAS chemicals found in water in Hoosick Falls, Petersburgh, Newburgh and elsewhere in the state. They are PFOA — perfluorooctanoic acid — and PFOS — perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. But the recommendation has not officially been adopted by the state Department of Health. If it were in force, it would be the most stringent state standard in the nation. The chemical industry has gradually withdrawn PFAS from the market, putting in place substitutes like GenX. But advocates have pointed to studies casting doubt on industry claims that GenX and other chemicals like it are much of an improvement. The industry generally has been supportive of efforts to fight contamination, including specific ceilings for PFAS. But they warn against what they see as overkill. "The weight of scientific evidence does not support some of the proposed policies that are currently under consideration," said John Banovetz, a senior vice president at 3M Corp. "In fact, no public health agency in the world has found that PFAS cause harm to human health at past or current exposure levels." He added: "Legislatively dictated, predetermined outcomes that don't follow the science would undermine the integrity of the regulatory process going forward." The discovery of toxins in drinking water turned Hoosick Falls into a ground zero of sorts for chemical pollution in water. PFAS do not dissipate once they infiltrate ground water. Studies have linked the chemicals to kidney, breast and testicular cancer. The EPA designated parts of the village as Superfund cleanup sites, and its drinking water is now filtered by equipment supplied by the plastics manufacturer blamed for causing the pollution, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, a multinational corporation based in France. The village of Hoosick Falls has been involved in legal action against Saint-Gobain and Honeywell International, another operator of a factory in the area. Gillibrand and Capito are both members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which will hold a legislative hearing on chemical pollution next Wednesday. In addition, the House Energy & Commerce subcommittee on environment and climate change, chaired by Rep. Paul Tonko, D-Amsterdam, will hold a hearing Wednesday on 13 House bills also aimed at reining in PFAS pollution. Among them is one authored by freshman Rep. Antonio Delgado, D-Rhinebeck, which would require EPA public reporting of PFAS releases. Among the witnesses testifying will be Emily Marpe, a mother and community member from Petersburgh.

 By Brian Nearing Watervliet A military contractor at the Watervliet Arsenal is paying a $50,000 fine for failing to properly maintain air pollution control equipment, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Hartchrom Inc., a chrome plating company that lines cannon tubes for the U.S. Army, also agreed to improve its inspection and record-keeping for equipment used to control pollution from its chroming process. During two visits to the Building 35 facility in early August 2018, state inspectors found that Hartchrom workers were failing to inspect the pollution control equipment for cracks or leaks. The inspectors then discovered cracks in equipment meant to remove chromium, a toxic, carcinogenic heavy metal. If Hartchrom fixes the issues, DEC agreed to suspend an additional $10,000 fine, according to an agreement signed by DEC and Hartchrom last month. Calls to Hartchrom for comment Tuesday weren't returned. Calls to Michael Sterthous, an Albany-based lawyer for Hartchrom, which has been at the arsenal since 2002, for comment also weren't returned. In March 2017, the Swiss-based company was awarded a $17 million contract from the U.S. Army to perform chrome-plating and surfacing operations for cannon barrels on 120 millimeter and 155 millimeter cannon. According to a DEC statement, the agency has "no evidence of Hartchrom violating emission standards." When pollution equipment was tested by state inspectors in October 2015, it was found to be operating within acceptable limits, according to DEC. When the cracks were found in August 2018, the equipment was again found to be working properly. DEC indicated that Hartchrom was last cited by DEC in 2010 for violations that included beginning construction without a permit. In 2014, the company got into a dispute with arsenal managers over the company's attempted improper disposal of tainted production liquid at the facility's wastewater treatment plant. Arsenal officials stopped the company from dumping 39,000 gallons of tainted liquid, forcing Hartchrom to dispose of the liquid as hazardous waste. Afterward, Hartchrom tried to recoup what it claimed were more than $92,000 in disposal and lost revenue expenses from the U.S. Army. But last year, the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals denied the claim. Calls to arsenal officials for comment weren't returned. Last year, the Army took back management control of the arsenal from the not-for-profit Arsenal Business & Technology Partnership, which had brought in Hartchrom as a tenant.

 By Brian Nearing Schenectady Toxic chemicals will be dug out of two vacant former dry cleaners sites in Schenectady and Watervliet, under plans announced by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The property around the former Admiral Cleaners, 617 19th St., Watervliet, and the former Kenwood Cleaners, 445 Duane Ave., Schenectady, are tainted with high levels of a carcinogenic dry cleaning solvent, tetrachloroethene (PCE), and related toxic byproducts. Exposure to PCE likely increases cancer risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Primary effects from chronic, long-term inhalation exposure are neurological, including impaired cognitive and motor neurobehavioral performance, according to EPA. PCE exposure may also "cause adverse effects in the kidney, liver, immune system and hematologic system, and on development and reproduction," according to the EPA. DEC plans to dig up and dispose of about 15 feet of PCE-tainted soil around the Admiral site and remove an underground storage tank, according to agency paperwork. The site closed in 2017, but had been a dry cleaners since 1950 before closing in 2013 due to environmental violations. After that, it was used as a drop-off shop for dry cleaning, where clothes were taken elsewhere to be cleaned. The $400,000 cost of the program would be paid for the by the state Superfund program, which covers the expense of cleanups when the person or company responsible for the pollution cannot pay or refuses to do so. A copy of the plan can be found in the office of the Watervliet city clerk at 2 Fifteenth St., Watervliet. At the former Kenwood site, about 20 feet of PCE-tainted soil will be removed and disposed of as part of a $1.1 million cleanup plan, according to DEC paperwork. It also will be paid for through the state Superfund program. The cleaners opened in 1950, and operated as late as the 1980s, according to DEC. PCE was found in both the ground and groundwater at levels well beyond state safety standards. PCE vapors were also found to be leaking out of the ground, including at one unspecified "off-site" location. A copy of the plan can be found at the Phyllis Bornt Branch Library, 948 State St., Schenectady.

 Diane Dupuis is the new development director at FLOW (For Love Of Water), the Traverse City-based organization dedicated to preserving the waters of the Great Lakes basin. She previously spent ten years at Interlochen Center for the Arts in communications and fund-development roles before fundraising for two land conservancies. She joins FLOW at a propitious time; the organization has been in the forefront of two high-profile legal fights. One concerns the drawing of water by Nestle in Mecosta County, and the other is the dispute over Line 5 running under the Straits of Mackinac.Northern Express sits down with Dupuis to talk ground water, high water, water justice, and the critical flow that moves — or drains — the people’s fight: money. What is your background?I’m the daughter of two Detroit Public Schools educators and social justice activists. I grew up in the Detroit area, attended Kalamazoo College, and worked in Detroit’s publishing sector for the first part of my career. In 2001 my husband, musician Steve Carey, and I relocated to the Traverse City area with our two small children, and I began working at Interlochen Center for the Arts, first in communications and then in fundraising. From there I joined the fund development staff at the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy. When my elderly mom needed looking after downstate, I was able to make that transition by working in development in Ann Arbor, at Legacy Land Conservancy and then the Ann Arbor Art Center. My nonprofit experience also includes service on the boards of Michigan Writers and Washtenaw Literacy, and I currently serve as vice chair of Michigan Audubon. I’m a hiker, cross-country skier, and sea kayaker equally mesmerized by campfires, star-gazing, and rock-strewn beaches. So why FLOW? Like many lifelong Michiganians as well as those who embrace Michigan later in life, I feel a fundamental connection to our waters, and along with that a conviction that we all share a responsibility for safeguarding this precious asset. In addition to the beauty and grandeur of our waters, and along with the recreational delights and the wildlife habitat they afford, our water is also crucial to human health. Access to clean drinking water is a universal need, and I can’t think of a more important issue facing us at this time than water justice. In working to keep public water publicly available, FLOW collaborates with many partners throughout the Great Lakes states and Canadian provinces from right here in the Grand Traverse region, a water-lover’s paradise. FLOW is the right place for me to roll up my sleeves and live my values, inspired every day amidst a landscape defined by water. Where does FLOW get its funding? Why does FLOW need a development director?FLOW is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that depends on charitable donations to fund our work. Financial support comes from individuals, corporate sponsors, and foundations throughout the Great Lakes basin. We also benefit from the time and expertise that volunteers devote to our effort, everything from helping to make our office run smoothly to pro bono legal work. Midwesterners are particularly generous in supporting causes they believe in, and our region is fortunate to sustain a bright constellation of very worthy organizations working to enhance lives. At FLOW, one aspect of my job is to help ensure that everyone who cares about water justice in the Great Lakes can, with their generosity, participate in moving FLOW’s work forward. Another aspect is to help supporters appreciate how their generosity makes a positive difference in protecting public water from private interests. The part of each day that I most look forward to is thanking all the committed and insightful people who pitch in with energy, resources, and hope. Two of the biggest issues around water and FLOW are Line 5 and Nestle’s continued drawing water. What is the latest on those? As long as the multinational Enbridge Energy continues to operate Line 5 (a major oil pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac), a massive area of the Great Lakes is at risk of a catastrophic oil spill. Last spring, Michigan’s Attorney General Dana Nessel ruled that previous laws and agreements with Enbridge were unconstitutional, invalid, and unenforceable. In June, Enbridge filed suit in the Court of Claims in Lansing against the State of Michigan and its departments to resuscitate the oil tunnel deal. FLOW is providing crucial legal and science support to the effort to decommission the Line 5 pipeline by forcing compliance with environmental and public trust laws. Earlier this fall, the Michigan Court of Claims issued orders accepting FLOW’s and the City of Mackinac Island’s amicus briefs, which reject opposing arguments by Enbridge. The ruling means that vital issues raised by FLOW’s “friend of the court” brief and the city’s brief will be considered by the Michigan Court of Claims, including the public trust rights of citizens to draw drinking water from and otherwise use the Great Lakes, and the soils and bottomlands beneath them, unimpaired by private interests. Also, the fight to keep public water from being sold for private profit remains a focus for FLOW. Private landowners have a right to reasonable use of water for the benefit of their land. But reasonable use does not mean robbing large volumes of water from the headwaters of our streams, lakes, and wetlands—water taken for free and sold elsewhere for private gain. While Nestle pays $200 a year to extract 210 million gallons of water that belongs to everyone, people in our communities have lost access to clean, affordable drinking water. A multinational water bottler’s excessive profiteering doesn’t sit well when people in Flint reel from the lack of access to water safe from the risk of lead poisoning, or tens of thousands of people in Detroit continue to suffer the indignity and harm to families and health from water shutoffs because they cannot afford the high price of water to meet their basic needs, or communities throughout the state wrestle with groundwater contamination from PFAS and other pollutants. What water issues are we dealing with (or ignoring) in this region?Michigan is “The Great Lakes State” but is a failing steward of the sixth Great Lake, the water lying beneath Michigan’s ground. FLOW is calling for state-level reforms to strengthen protection of Michigan’s groundwater. That includes statewide monitoring and replacement of failing septic systems. Michigan prides itself on being an environmental leader, particularly in curbing water pollution. But in one area of water policy, Michigan is dead last among the 50 states: It is the only state in the nation that lacks a uniform sanitary code requiring periodic inspection and maintenance of septic systems – even though 30 percent of Michiganians rely on such systems. An estimated 130,000 septic systems in the state are failing, releasing 5.2 billion gallons of sewage annually into Michigan waters. Numerous Michigan rivers and lakes have detectable levels of human fecal bacteria. Groundwater, too, is contaminated by septic wastes. This issue needs more attention throughout Michigan. What is the deal with the high water levels? How will this affect us going forward?Scientists don’t know whether Great Lakes levels will rise or fall in response to climate change, as increases in precipitation may be offset by increased evaporation from higher temperatures and reduced ice cover. Climate science makes clear, though, that the frequency and severity of storm events will increase the potential for unprecedented, rapid changes in Great Lakes levels. We only have to look back six years or so to a time when water levels in 2013 were significantly lower than average, compared to the high levels we see today. This dramatic fluctuation in water levels is yet another sign of the climate crisis that is evidenced by extremes of all kinds: storms, droughts, floods, wildfires, polar melting, record-breaking temperatures, and more. Is avian botulism still a thing Up North?Avian botulism kills diving ducks and loons, often as they begin their migratory flight to winter habitat. The numbers are down from a high in 2012 or thereabouts. Of the six or so bird carcasses collected in the Sleeping Bear Dunes area this fall, I’m told that avian botulism was detected in about half.Where else does FLOW work? Are there other Great Lakes efforts we should be aware of in this area?Around the Great Lakes, which contain roughly 20 percent of the world’s available surface fresh water, old and failing infrastructure, urbanization, intense agricultural uses, runoff and many more sources are threatening water quality. For specific localities around the region, “OUR20” is a FLOW initiative that empowers local communities to instill the values of water stewardship in their policies and practices. This grassroots, place-based program is built on the knowledge that water is precious to all, and its stewardship has the potential to unite communities in achieving environmental goals. Any community can adopt the “OUR20” model. How can people can get involved/take action?Becoming and staying informed is fundamental, and FLOW’s twice-monthly e-newsletter is a great place to start. It highlights issues and events, and offers information on specific actions that individuals can undertake to increase their involvement and create change. Sign up is easy, at flowforwater.org/get-involved/sign-up-here/. We also encourage citizens to follow us on Facebook to stay abreast of water news on a daily basis. Follow us here: Facebook.com/FlowforWater. FLOW also welcomes volunteers for a range of activities. And, of course, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t mention our website’s donation page: https://flowforwater.org/donate/ Is water the next precious commodity? What does than mean for the Great Lakes? Nature and ecological systems provide trillions of dollars in annual benefits to humanity. The Great Lakes and their tributary rivers and streams, wetlands, and groundwater – the largest fresh surface water system in the world – are an immense source of natural capital that will become increasingly valuable as the accumulating effects of climate change stress the global environment, and worsening water scarcity draws attention to the water wealth of the Great Lakes region. As populations shift to water-rich regions, infrastructure and water justice will become increasingly critical, as will the imperative to keep public water publicly available. What's needed most right now? Where should the general public be putting forth their time, energy and money? Water is at the nexus of food, energy, transportation, the climate crisis, social justice, and the economy. Solutions based on law and science can prevail with public support.ART, MEET WATER (AND FUNDRAISING SUCCESS)Part art exhibit, part fundraiser, and all about the water, Higher Art Gallery’s “Source: Artists for FLOW” exhibit recently featured 32 pieces — created by 21 different artists — connected to and/or commentaries on the region’s land and water. Thanks to proceeds from the opening night event and works sold, the gallery raised $4,500 for FLOW. The event and exhibit were not only one of two fundraisers gallery owner Shanny Brooke creates each year to give back to the community but also proof of how effectively art and water can work together — a foundation FLOW communications coordinator Jacob Wheeler said feeds FLOW’s new Art Meets Water initiative. “It’s clear that one of the most important ways to connect with water is to connect emotionally,” he said. And art appeals to the emotions. “Literature, music, dance, poetry, and art all come into play. To get people to think more of water and what FLOW does, [art] is a great tool.” The organization’s new Art Meets Water hub features inspirational tools aplenty: a groundwater video that includes a painting by Glenn Wolff and narration by Anne-Marie Oomen; photos of the artists and their work at Higher Art Gallery; Oomen's "Love Letters to the Lakes," presented to the International Joint Commission this summer; and video of Crispin Campbell and Michael Delp's cello-poetry collaboration at FLOW’s “In Praise of Water” benefit last June at the Cathedral Barn in the Commons.

 Located on 200 acres on a pond in the woods between Kalkaska and Mancelona, the Au Sable Institute still looks like the small summer boys camp it once was, since its founding in the 1950s.But it’s much more than a camp today. Throughout the school year, Au Sable hosts hundreds of students from around northern Michigan for field trips exploring the natural world. Each summer, the institute hosts 30 to 40 college students from around the country to teach them how to be Christian environmentalists.Au Sable is the headquarters for an institute that runs environmental studies campuses in Washington State, Costa Rica, India, and, beginning next year, Chicago.Fred Van Dyke, Au Sable’s executive director, is a formally trained wildlife biologist and self-taught theologian, and he’s passionate about expressing his faith through environmental work. That might make Van Dyke unusual among evangelicals, but Van Dyke hopes to change that, one student and a time.Northern Express trekked into the woods to visit Van Dyke at the institute’s campus and learned about how the place started and what they do. Northern Express: So, if I follow correctly, Dr. Harold Snyder established this place first as the Au Sable Trails Camp for Youth in the 1950s, and, over the years it evolved into the institute that it is today. A major turning point that made that possible came in 1979, after Au Sable received an incredible gift. Fred Van Dyke: Yes. One of the gifts, not the only one, was the fact that Harold bought this land originally from a man named Louie Kleinschmidt. And Louie was not particularly well-liked, locally. He was an alcoholic and lived alone in a trailer in the woods. He didn’t have many friends, but Harold consistently befriended him. Harold wanted to win Louie to Jesus Christ, so he often brought Louie over to the camp to meet the boys, get comfortable. Louie did, and it was very moving for him. Harold relates that Louie often cried when he talked to the boys. As far as we know, Harold did not succeed in his primary objective. But one winter when they hadn’t heard or seen Louie around for a while, one of the neighbors went to the trailer and banged on the door. No answer. He went inside. And Louie was dead. But Louie had changed his will, and in his will, he had bequeathed to the institute 80 acres, close to but not contiguous with it, down on Sunset Trail, close to Pickerel Lake. Express: And that turned out to be a very valuable piece of property. Van Dyke: No one thought much of it at the time because it was covered with scrubby pines. But Louis also bequeathed with that land the mineral rights, and as the energy development began in this part of the country in the 1970s, some energy companies approached the board and asked for permission to explore that back 80. The board didn’t initially agree, but they negotiated with a lot of different companies and finally reached an agreement. And the deposit that they struck has been one of the longest-lasting and most productive — both with oil and natural gas — in northern Michigan. That led to a lot of royalties. To be as precise as possible, 1979 is an important year, because that is when Au Sable officially became an Institute. Express: Do you agree that it’s ironic that an institute dedicated to environmental studies owes its life to oil money? Is there anything about that that you find problematic? Van Dyke: Well, some people do, but I think it’s not as ironic as it looks, for several reasons. The first is that I haven’t been an academic all my life. I used to work for Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks as a wildlife biologist, and I know that my helicopter that we used to radio-collar the moose and the elk and the deer, was burning about 15 to 20 gallons of flight fuel per hour. And the Super Cub, the plane I used to track them, was burning about six to 10 gallons an hour. And if we get bigger, it takes 500,000 gallons of rocket fuel to put one satellite in orbit that will track whales and ospreys and all kinds of long-distance moving creatures.Conservation is very energy demanding. If you make it more local, in order to teach the students how to care for God’s creation, to do a good job, we’re going to have to move them off of this campus sometimes, so we will consume gasoline and fossil fuels like that in the course of their education. So, in that sense, whether we had the wells or not, we would be a consumer of fossil fuels until we succeed in transforming our technology, which we intend to do over the long haul, so it doesn’t need carbon emission-type fuels. Express: You’ve given this a lot of thought. Van Dyke: The second dimension of it, which is not as much ironic as it is appropriate, is that we recognize being part of the problem of landscape fragmentation. The Au Sable well, when it was put in, removed forest, and that’s happened on over 60,000 well sites in Michigan. So, we engaged the DNR and two energy companies in a study of the best methods for reforesting abandoned oil pads, because they don’t reforest themselves. We just completed the field work on that. My goal is that this work will be submitted [for publication in an academic journal] in early 2020.So, we recognize that we’re part of the problem. And this, I think, is the more significant problem than just the fact that the oil came out of the ground — the fact that you’ve changed the system. So, we’re working with energy companies and the DNR to find a way to put those sites back into a forest ecosystem, and then to publish that so it’s accessible and shared with the whole scientific and conservation community. So that is an appropriate act of our repentance. And the third reason why I admit I don’t feel great angst is when we consider how Au Sable acquired the endowment: It didn’t come from any scheming or deception or any kind of contractual ploy. It happened because Au Sable’s founder, acting as a disciple of Jesus Christ, very intentionally went about loving somebody that nobody else loved. Express: I know a lot of what you do here has a national or international focus, but you also dedicate a lot of time to educating children from all over northern Michigan. Tell me about that. Van Dyke: There’s all kinds of local engagement. One is the Environmental Leadership Intensive Program, a professional development program for current or post-graduate students who are especially interested in environmental education and in working in and someday leading a not-for-profit organization. So, they teach K–12 students from home, parochial, and public schools all around us in northern Michigan. And when they’re not teaching, they’re actively engaged with the staff in lessons about how not-for-profits are organized, how they’re led, what kind of skills you need, how they’re budgeted, so that when the person leaves, we want them to be able to be a good teacher, but also be a good staffer in an environmental organization. The teaching aspect goes back to the very beginning of the institute, and over 130,000 people have gone through the environmental program here on this campus to learn about creation care. Express: Do you ever encounter conflicts as a Christian organization that works a lot with public schools? Van Dyke: No. In the public school, we’re going to present the knowledge and skills and techniques needed to care for God’s creation even if the school doesn’t acknowledge that’s what it is and calls it nature, which is okay. Now, when we work in other contexts, where it’s explicitly important for them to know our mission, then we are explicit about that, and our mission is one that we state as “Au Sable inspires and educates people to serve, protect and restore God’s Earth.” And then all of the theological basis behind that has also been an important work of the institute. But we don’t encounter conflict, because we are engaged in doing work that God wants us to do, but our work in that setting is not to evangelize the students; it’s to do the work. Express: Does having your mission based on Christianity lead to any notable difference between the Au Sable Institute and secular environmental groups? Van Dyke: We have a lot of similarities and shared goals and aspirations, and sometimes, when we work together, some shared achievements. We have differences in what we think are the key foundational pillars of what we are doing. I would say from a Christian standpoint, there are five: We affirm biblically that all of creation is good; that is the issue of moral value. We affirm that, with moral value, there is appropriate moral agency in human beings, and the right response is to serve and protect, which comes to us from Genesis 2:15: “The Lord God took the man and put him the Garden of Eden to serve it and to protect it.” We affirm the capacity and the responsibility and authority of human beings to actually do the work — that’s the capacity that comes from being made in the image of God, so you have the capacity to be a reflective interactant with other creatures. You can understand what their needs are and act on that. And the authority to act as a representative of God — not in physical likeness, but in personal presence — and pursue the same aims that He would have for the good of his creation. And the fifth pillar is that we have redemptive hope. Our work has significance because all of creation is included in God’s plan of redemption and restoration, and so we don’t have to be filled with despair if we save this endangered species today, and it becomes extinct in 10 years. That would be tragic, but it’s not a basis for despair, nor is it even to be expected because we affirm and believe hopefully that God has a plan for restoring his creation, and we are acting congruently. So those are differences. Express: I can see also that there must be a lot of overlap, also, because your objectives are going to be mostly similar. Van Dyke: Yeah. There’s overlap there. I think one of the biggest differences is we are willing to ask a question that a lot of conservation organizations aren’t willing to ask, and that’s the “So, what?” question. So, what if we accomplish this and maybe it turns out badly in 10 years or 20? We answer that by saying there is significance to our work because it’s cooperative with and congruent with a long-term eternal destiny for creation. It’s not work that’s done in vain. Express: What happens when you encounter conflicts between Scripture and science? Van Dyke: Well, we don’t fundamentally encounter those conflicts. I mean, if you’re talking about a literal interpretation of six days of creation, you know, that might be a conflict if we felt compelled to adopt that view, but that’s one of many interpretations of that part of Genesis, and has been for centuries, going back to Augustine. So we see no conflict there because we’re affirming the truth of the Genesis narrative that creation is an act of God; it didn’t create itself, it doesn’t sustain itself, and it doesn’t have goodness in itself. Its goodness is imparted to it and made a part of it by God. So, no. In terms of specifics, we don’t experience and see conflicts between science and Scripture. Science is not designed to answer the questions that Scripture is answering. Express: Tell me about how you went from being a Montana conservation officer to the director of Au Sable. Van Dyke: For the record, I wasn’t a conservation officer, although I helped them sometimes in law enforcement. I was a wildlife research biologist. I had spent a little time in academia before that at a small Christian college in Indiana, then five years in Montana, then back to academia at a Christian college in northwestern Iowa, then to Wheaton [College, in Illinois]. I think in that whole spread I was always trying to express my faith in what I did and what I said and what I wrote. So, I published a lot of scientific studies, but I also wrote books about Christian ethics and environmental care. One’s called “Redeeming Creation,” and the other is called “Between Heaven and Earth.” Those are two of the best known. I also was trying to contribute to my own field, so I produced a textbook in conservation biology. Express: It seems like you had these two things that made you ideal for your current position. Van Dyke: It gave me some positive characteristics. There were other people that were considered, so I’m grateful and pleased the trustees finally selected me, but I think all I was really trying to do my whole life was be myself. I wasn’t trying to impress one side or the other by being something other than what I was. It is odd, because sometimes you don’t know quite where you fit in, but Au Sable is one place where I do. Express: What do you consider the most pressing environmental issue facing northern Lower Michigan? Van Dyke: We have several. Maybe you’ve heard there’s going to be a septic summit, in Traverse City on Nov. 6. Fifty states in the U.S., and there’s only one that doesn’t have a statewide septic ordinance. Yet Michigan defines itself by its water. “Four out of five Great Lakes prefer Michigan” — you can see that on bumper stickers. Right here, we’re within 40 minutes of the headwaters of six rivers. Two major fish hatcheries are within 40 minutes. One is a federal fish hatchery, and one is a state fish hatchery. The state fish hatchery, in Grayling, is probably about 35–40 minutes away. Most of the people living in the North are living on wells on their own property. Nevertheless, septic ordinances that regulate septic fields and their septic tanks is the only thing — if they exist at all — that stand between them and the pollution of the water they drink. So that’s a major issue for Michigan to address. A second problem is the restoration of vacated well and gas pads. We’ve got 60,000 of those — that’s probably close to 120,000 acres of land — and yet there’s no systemic plan as to how that land is going to be restored and to what purpose. That’s starting — I don’t want to give the DNR a bad name, they are startingto do it — but it still has a long way to go. And the third is to remove any significant threat from Pipeline 5 [Enbridge energy company’s expired pipeline that carries petroleum from western Canada to eastern Canada through the Straits of Mackinaw], either through some kind of underground technology or shutting it down. Express: What worldwide environmental issue concerns you the most? Van Dyke: Climate — well, two things. I was about to say climate change, and that’s still true, but climate change is really now one of a number of anthropogenic affects. You may know that even the official geologic societies are considering renaming the current epoch, because human beings are no longer just a disturbance that we have to mitigate. Humans are the driving force, geologically, biologically, ecologically, and climatologically. There are only perhaps 20 percent of ice-free terrestrial lands today that could be classed as wildlands or natural environments. Everything else is either human-inhabited or strongly human modified. So even the old maps of global ecosystems are, for most of the world, obsolete — no longer useful. So, what you’ve got to do is really figure out is not how to treat humans as a "disturbance," and then remove the disturbance from the system. Humans beings are no longer "disturbing" natural systems; they are shaping them, because human beings are driving the system, so you have to figure out how you do conservation in a human-dominated nature. That’s the big global issue, can you have a responsible Anthropocene [epoch]? Now, climate change is one of the biggest drivers. It’s one of the most pervasive anthropogenic effects, and it affects all conservation planning today. So, it’s probably the No. 1 hazard to deal with, because your risk is so high and is already materializing into a hazard. You’re already seeing the hazardous effects of climate change. Express: Do you find it frustrating that more Christians don’t think the way you do about this? Van Dyke: I guess I don’t dwell on it to think of it as a frustration. It’s one more problem to solve. There are many Christians who are active and quite eloquent. There are whole Christian organizations dedicated entirely to conservation, some dedicated entirely to climate change. I think that the larger body of evangelicals in the United States will have to at some point decide we’re going to be more discerning about individual issues and less tribal. Because there’s always a tendency of people to gravitate together to someone who holds out the promise that they will increase your influence — especially when you’re feeling your influence in society is being taken away by other sources. So, in that sense, evangelicals as a political group tend to be linked together with a constellation of issues. That’s not entirely unjustified, but some of it is, because some of the more in-depth surveys reveal that only about half of the voters who identify themselves as evangelicals actually hold evangelical beliefs. Why that half wants to be identified as evangelical, I’m still puzzled. Express: Are you saying that there are evangelicals out there that claim the political end of the movement but don’t care about the spiritual side of it? Van Dyke: Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying. And there’s a lot of them. And the media often overlook very prominent evangelicals doing good work.

 The folks I have met volunteering for environmental causes come from all walks of life. There’s some who spend their days looking through microscopes, some crunching numbers, some wiping noses. Some are retired, while others are still figuring out what they want to be when they grow up. Some of us spend our weekends following rivers and trails; others follow fantasy football.Our one commonality is our concern for where humanity is heading — and our desire to do something about it. What we do takes many forms. I try to keep it simple and focus on three questions:1) What will I do today? I will do something. I will not do nothing. Some days it will be a tiny thing: Call my member of Congress, buy local food, turn off the lights. Some days it will be a bigger thing: Make a donation, look for common ground with someone more conservative, plant a native species. Some days it will be a really big thing: Lobby my member of Congress, volunteer in Flint, stop yelling at the radio.2) What do I need to know?This one is trickier. I need to know enough to make sure what I do is effective, but I don’t always have time for what that might be. I try to learn as much as I can, but this question could instead become this: Who do I trust for the best information? Most of my fellow volunteers couldn’t explain the biology of lifeless soil or list the chemicals in fracking waste. We might not get the physics of shore erosion or the economics that allows Nestle to pump water from under our feet and truck it around the world. We don’t know much about designing a storm drain or the engineering that would keep a family’s home standing in 185 mile per hour winds. What we do know is to trust scientists who study the environment and our impact on it. We know to listen to what they have to say — about how to prevent things, fix things, and do better. The science that we trusted as we built modern society, cured disease, and went into space is the same science that is now telling us, “Whoa!” It is people using the same transparent, peer-reviewed research methods, driven by the same passion for knowledge, discovery, and truth. 3) Who else can I get to help?Anyone, everyone, whoever is ready. Are you ready? What will get you there? Sometimes environmentalism suffers under the weight of its own imagery — majestic mountain forests, the ubiquitous polar bear floating on the melting sea ice, the bald eagle saved from pesticides. What the logos miss is that what we are saving is ourselves. The natural world we seek to rescue is not “out there.” It is passing through our lungs, pouring from our faucets, and sitting on our plates. This reality is more apparent for those who will face it sooner, more severely, and who are least equipped to handle it. As a social service provider, I’m less moved by rain forests or polar bears than by the wheezing three-year-old who can’t breathe the air in his neighborhood. And that he or someone else in his family could be one of the 200,000 premature deaths caused by air pollution in the U.S. every year. It bothers me that people still live in places considered to be “cancer alleys,” or where air smells like gas fumes from refineries, or like ammonia from large-scale poultry operations. What keeps me up is wondering where thousands of Bahamians are sleeping tonight. It is one legacy of segregation and racism we need to face that, as the National Defense Council states, “Communities of color, which are often poor, are routinely targeted to host facilities that have negative environmental impacts.” Minority groups are disproportionately impacted by natural disasters, weather extremes, and food insecurity.Native Americans face similar challenges with disruption and pollution from extractive industries and agribusiness encroaching on their land and water resources.None of these problems exists in a vacuum. For solutions to work, they will have to work for everyone, requiring diverse voices led by those whose lives and economic well-being are most affected. This basic tenet of the Green New Deal is gaining traction and discussion in an ever-growing and coalescing movement. If one feels discouraged by the current administration’s seemingly endless rollbacks of environmental protections and assaults on human rights, remember this: Not that long ago, talking about environmental issues, especially climate change, was generally considered anti-business and pretty much political suicide. This year, even in this charged and divided political atmosphere, CNN ran seven hours of programming devoted exclusively to presidential candidates’ climate plans. This wouldn’t have been possible if people weren’t connecting the dots. Inclusion and innovation not only will transition us to a clean energy world but also to a just and prosperous one.

 MNA Staff Caption Close From the Lansing State Journal LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Scientists want to use an unconventional method to remove pollution at former General Motors properties near Lansing where an underground plume of chemicals is creeping toward drinking water wells. The Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust controls the former GM plants. It is proposing a remediation method called "biosparging," which removes pollution by injecting air into groundwater. The method encourages bacteria to consume 1,4-dioxane, an industrial chemical that GM used to clean oil off car parts. Should the trust gain state approval, the project would be among the first and likely the largest to use the method, the Lansing State Journal reported . It's unclear how much the project would cost, but engineers said it could take six to 12 years to fully clean the water. The pollution was discovered after the trust was established by the federal government to take over the GM sites following the company's bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. The dioxane plume is located under two former GM plants in Lansing Township and Lansing. Dave Favero, deputy cleanup manager for the Michigan properties, said dioxane is very soluble. If dioxane is in oil, as it was used at the GM plants, "it leaches out and starts to migrate with the groundwater," he said. Long-term exposure could lead to liver, kidney and reproductive problems and possibly cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Lansing-area plume is within the Lansing Board of Water and Light's wellhead protection area for some of its drinking water wells. Up to 10 of the utility's wells are downstream from the polluted groundwater. The utility started monitoring for dioxane in 2015, and found a small amount within the limits of what the EPA considers safe. The utility hasn't monitored dioxane levels that exceed the EPA's safe limit yet. The trust will need to get approval from state environmental regulators. Scientists and engineers could begin installing biosparging wells this year if the plan is approved.

 MNA Staff LANSING — Hoping for a quick thaw to escape the winter blues? Not so fast. A fast melt of accumulated snow could harm Michigan waters. The problem: Winter application of manure to farm fields. Rapidly melting snow runs off frozen ground and heads toward lakes and streams. It can carrying with it manure that sat on top of the snow. Snow accumulation in the state has been above average this year, National Weather Service Meteorologist Jared Maples said. Grand Rapids and Muskegon have more than 40 inches above yearly averages, while Lansing has more than 15 inches above the yearly average. The amount of water in the snow varies by location, Maples said, although areas lower in the state might have higher volumes. Currently, Grand Rapids has an estimated 5.6 inches of water in the snow, he said. While Maples said it’s difficult to foresee what kind of melt the state will have, indications are the coming weeks will remain cold. If manure reaches lakes and rivers, bacteria could harm fish and other aquatic creatures, said Karen Tommasulo, a public information officer with the Department of Environmental Quality. Phosphorous in manure causes algal blooms that can rob the water of oxygen. Other nutrients and bacteria could contaminate water and kill fish, Kauffman said. The International Joint Commission recently recommended that winter manure spreading be banned near Lake Erie, which has had issues with algal blooms in recent years. The binational agency advises the U.S. and Canada on issues involving waterways that they share. Spreading manure in the winter is high risk and should be banned, Kauffman said. Farmers are advised to avoid spreading manure in the winter if possible. Not all farmers spread manure in the winter. But they might have to if they lack storage for it or have winter crops, such as winter wheat, which need the nutrients, said Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau. Campbell said phosphorous contamination has many origins and that only one is farming. Those with insufficient storage space are typically smaller farms, Campbell said. Depending on farm size and whether it is an animal feeding operation, the smaller farms might not be required to hold permits for spreading manure, said Nicole Zacharda, enforcement specialist with the Department of Environment Quality Water Resources Division. Those that are required to hold the permits, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs, are required to have room enough for six months of manure storage. There are almost 250 of those in Michigan. Farmers should distribute manure at least 150 feet from any surface water and avoid putting the manure on fields with slopes, said Shelby Bollwahn, livestock environmental educator with Michigan State University Extension. People can report runoff to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s spill response at 1-800-405-0101 and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality’s Pollution Control hotline at 800-292-4706. Farmers who cause a runoff problem that pollutes the water could be fined between $2,500 and $25,000, Zacharda said. The Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program helps farmers prepare and avoid runoff by teaching best practices and helping determine ideal fields for winter manure application. Program manager Jan Wilford said 600 of Michigan’s about 22,000 livestock farms are in the program and have had no issues polluting Michigan water in 12 years. “I don’t think it’s something to panic about,” Campbell said. “Our farmers are really aware of the water patterns.” Banning the practice would also lead to farmers spreading manure only twice a year, creating a higher risk for large amounts of pollution if runoff occurs at those times, Wilford said. However, some critics of the practice are still concerned. “There is a fundamental problem that we can collect so much liquid waste and then try to spread it on fields,” said Anne Woiwode, state director of the Sierra Club’s Michigan chapter. Woiwode said although some say that banning the practice would hurt small farms and force them out of business, industrial agriculture practices have put small farms in this position. Bollwahn said while warmer weather and potential rain could create higher risk for runoff, the farmers have the tools to deal with potential issues. Besides following best practices, once runoff is identified, Zacharda said farmers can use sand to stop the flow or pumps to remove the manure from water after it has sunk to the bottom.

 Tribune News Services MCT NEWS SERVICE Beaches across the country are being polluted with tainted runoff and sewage at a stubbornly high rate, putting swimmers at risk of getting sick, according to a new report by an environmental group. The Natural Resources Defense Council found the number of beach water samples that failed health tests dipped to 7 percent last year from 8 percent the year before, but said the drop is the result of less rainfall flushing contaminants to the shore, not an overall decline in pollution. Delaware, New Hampshire and North Carolina had the cleanest beaches in 2012, according to the group’s annual Testing the Waters report. The states with the most polluted beaches were Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio. The findings showed little progress for California beaches, which were responsible for 25 percent of the beach closures in the nation. California ranked 20th out of 30 states for beach water quality. The number of beach closings and advisories in California fell slightly in 2012, but not nearly enough to show that beach pollution is improving, said Noah Garrison, staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We want to see that number dropping,” he said. “Unfortunately we still see large numbers of closing and advisory days and we still have persistent pollution problems at our beaches.” The report analyzed bacterial test results and public advisories from more than 3,000 beaches in 30 coastal and Great Lakes states. A high bacteria count indicates the presence of pathogens that can give swimmers skin rashes, eye infections or stomach and respiratory illnesses. Interactive maps in the report allow readers to search by ZIP code with mobile phones to find water quality ratings and swimming advisories for their favorite beach. The report called for stronger beach water quality standards to prevent swimmers from being exposed to contaminated beach water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year approved a new set of beach water quality standards, but environmental groups say they are not stringent enough to protect public health. The Natural Resources Defense Council also recommended adopting faster testing methods. The bacteria-based tests used to monitor beaches across the country can take several days to obtain results and warn swimmers. “You could go swimming Saturday morning at the beach and not know until Monday whether it’s safe to get in the water,” Garrison said. Some areas have experimentedwith beach water tests that provide same-day results, but they are not yet widely used. To clean up beaches in the long term, the council said coastal areas should build rain-absorbing infrastructure to prevent contaminated runoff from reaching the shore or triggering sewage overflows.

 Thursday, March 19, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan By Brandon Schreur | on October 22, 2019 Belding Mayor Brad Miller reads through two proposed ordinances regarding air pollution and trichloroisocyanuric acid during last Tuesday’s Belding City Council meeting. The ordinances will be voted on by the City Council during the Oct. 29 meeting at 7 p.m. in the Pere Marquette Depot. — DN Photo | Brandon Schreur BELDING — The city of Belding is in the process of creating new laws to prevent air pollution following this past summer’s trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA) incidents at a local factory. On June 22, a fire involving TCICA at Kassouni Manufacturing Inc. (KMI) produced a chlorine cloud over Belding. Three days later, a second TCICA fire broke out at the property. In the weeks that followed, many residents expressed their concerns and frustration over a lack of communication on the topic from the city. While an Ionia County judge signed an order in August that allows the Belding chlorine manufacturer to continue conducting business that does not involve the use of TCICA, city officials are now taking preventative measures to ensure similar situations don’t arise. During Tuesday’s meeting, the Belding City Council unveiled the first reading of two ordinances that enforce restrictions involving chemicals related to manufacturing. “We aren’t voting on any of these tonight,” Mayor Brad Miller told the council. “This is the first reading, meaning that we’ll vote on them during the next meeting.” If approved, Ordinance No. 552 will amend a previous zoning ordinance in Belding by providing greater distances between public areas and manufacturing areas that “utilize, produce or have the potential to produce a corrosive acid or alkali, cement, lime, gypsum or plaster of paris.” “Access driveways shall be located no less than 100 feet from the centerline of the intersection of any street or any other driveway,” the proposed ordinance reads. “The principal and accessory buildings and structures shall not be located within one thousand feet of any residential use or district.” City Manager John Niemela explained this ordinance would give the city greater control over the chemicals that are being used in Belding. Grand Rapids Roofers work on fixing the roof at Kassouni Manufacturing Inc. The Belding chlorine manufacturing company experienced a series of TCICA fires over the past summer. — Submitted photo “We looked at our ordinance in relation to manufacturing facilities, and one of the areas we felt we needed to strengthen is in the area of activities that are permitted under special land use for zoning and manufacturing, and the use of certain chemicals and products,” he said. “…This puts us in a better position of being able to control what products are being used or manufactured in those facilities.” Ordinance No. 553 addressed the problem of TCICA in relation to special air pollution control standards. “There have been at least seven prior instances during which the hazardous chemical compound known as (TCICA) has been handled in a dangerous, negligent and otherwise unlawful manner on lands in the I-1 District, resulting in either smoldering chemical reactions or fires, and consequent releases of dangerous and/or toxic gases to the atmosphere,” the proposed ordinance explains. “These incidents have required that the city repeatedly deploy emergency service personnel to the site of the releases, at significant cost to the city and its taxpayers. These incidents have resulted in the insurance of ‘shelter in place’ orders of nearby residents, and nearby residents have reported adverse health effects resulting from the exposure to released hazardous gases, including burning skin and respiratory irritation.” The document goes on to say that, given the dangerous properties of TCICA and the risk it puts residents in, the use of the chemical within a specific area will require approval from the City Council. A new thermoplastic polyolefin new roof at Kassouni is said to last the chlorine manufacturing company “for years to come.” — Submitted photo “No person may engage in a manufacturing process on lands zoned in the I-1 District that involves TCICA if the manufacturing process would occur in a facility that is located a distance less than 1,320 feet (1/4-mile) from any residential property line or residential zoning district boundary line, unless prior approval has been obtained from the City Council,” the ordinance reads. The person seeking the council’s approval must prove that the total amount of TCICA they wish to use will not create a chlorine gas concentration at the nearest residential property or zoning district boundary line. A violation of ordinance 553 is considered to be a public nuisance and a misdemeanor that’s subject to penalty for each violation. “In addition to any remedies provided by this section or otherwise available to the city at law, the city may bring an action for an injunction or initiate other available processes against a person to restrain, prevent or abate any violation of this article,” the proposed ordinance reads. Niemela emphasized that the city wrote this ordinance to better control the use of potentially harmful chemicals. “We didn’t really have a strong ordinance on air pollution standards,” he told the council. “This ordinance, if approved, would give us strength in being able to regulate certain products in terms of discharge into the open air. It’s regulatory power and control as to what could be released and, if it is, how we can treat those violations.” The City Council will vote on the ordinances during the Oct. 29 meeting at 7 p.m. in the Pere Marquette Depot. Since the incidents over the summer, KMI hired Grand Rapids Roofers for maintenance repair to the building. “110 square tear off, replacing deck and new 60 mil (thermoplastic polyolefin roofing),” Grand Rapids Roofers posted to the Greenville Matters Facebook page. “Was a pleasure dealing with the wonderful owners of KMI and looking to redo their building after purchasing it. With a new roof that will last them for years to come and a long warranty from (Grand Rapids Roofers) with double rain protection.” You must be logged in to post a comment. Our Hometown

 Thursday, March 19, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan By Cory Smith | on July 27, 2019 GREENVILLE — A local manufacturer is facing penalties for violating state and federal air quality standards as a result of equipment installed in 2017. Dicastal North America, located at 1 Dicastal Drive in Greenville, is facing $226,170 in penalties to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy for alleged air pollution violations of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act. — DN Photo | Cory Smith The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) Air Quality Division (AQD), is seeking resolution from Dicastal North America, Inc., located at 1 Dicastal Drive in the city’s industrial park, for alleged air pollution violations of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act. According to the AQD, specifically, Dicastal exceeded matter emission limits in regards to: particulate matter (PM); particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10); and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PM consists of a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. PM10 consists of inhalable particles with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller while PM2.5 consists of “fine inhalable” particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller. According to the EPA, PM particles “are so small that they can be inhaled and cause serious health problems.” Some particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter can get deep into one’s lungs and some may even get into the bloodstream. Of these, particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter pose the greatest risk to health. Fine particles are also the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) in parts of the United States, including national parks and wilderness areas. According to the summary report released by EGLE, Dicastal also failed to maintain a minimum thermal oxidizer volatile organic compound (VOC) destruction efficiency of 95% and a three-hour block average temperature above 725 degrees celsius — and failed to conduct an annual capture and collection system inspection as required by the Code of Federal Regulations. Dicastal was initially issued a Permit to Install (PTI) a new thermal aluminum chip dryer (EU-ChipDryer) on January 13, 2017. Compliance testing was performed on May 8-10 of 2018 and the test results documented the exceedance of the PM, PM10 and PM2.5 emission limits. The test results also documented a VOC destruction efficiency that was below the permit limit of 95%. Additionally, record-keeping violations were discovered during an inspection conducted on April 4, 2018. On 16 occasions, facility records documented that the three-hour block average temperature of the afterburner controlling emissions from the EU-ChipDryer was below the minimum required temperature of 725 degrees Celsius. Also, the company failed to conduct an annual inspection of the capture and collection system of the EU-ChipDryer, as required by the Code of Federal Regulations. In August of 2018, Dicastal Engineering Manager Michael James informed the EGLE in a letter it was aware of the exceeded levels. “Although particulate emissions from the thermal chip dryer have exceeded permit limits, emissions from the facility remain less than the Title V major source thresholds of 100 tons per year,” he wrote. According to James, tests performed by Fishbeck, Thompson, Carr & Huber Inc. on PM10 and PM2.5 emissions indicated ambient impacts for the facility would continue to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Unable to find a solution to lower the levels to meet the requirements of the PTI, Dicastal proposed installing a baghouse on the thermal chip dryer to correct the violation. In regards to the VOC efficiency and temperature drop, Dicastal planned to remove the thermal oxidizer as part of the work associated with installing the new baghouse, which it believes will fix both issues. In regards to failing to conduct annual inspections, James attributed that to a turnover in staff. “Contracting the capture and collection system annual inspection was assigned to a process engineer who has since departed Dicastal,” James wrote. “In addition, the facility has had some difficulty in finding a contractor in the area to perform the annual inspection. Dicastal is working to find a contractor and plan on having the inspection completed b7 Oct. 31, 2018. As the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (Now EGLE) is aware, Dicastal is a new facility and proper operation and maintenance of the thermal chip dryer has taken more time than anticipated. Dicastal is committed to working with (EGLE) to bring the thermal chip dryer back into compliance.” As a result of these violations, the EGLE issued a consent order, which Dicastal is expected to comply with. Dicastal North America Inc. did not respond to a request for comment for this story to verify the consent order will be complied with. Under the agreed-upon terms of the proposed consent order, the company has agreed to comply with the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations, including performing emission testing to confirm compliance with the emission limits established in the PTI for the baghouse of the EU-ChipDryer. The proposed Consent Order incorporates a monetary settlement amount of $226,170 to the state of Michigan general fund, and according to Jeff Rathbun of the AQD, failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the consent order could result in a maximum stipulated penalty of $7,500.00 per violation per day. “AQD staff believes that the proposed consent order, as drafted, contains an appropriate compliance program for resolution of the federal and state air quality violations against the company,” Rathbun said in the conclusion of his report. “The AQD staff recommends that the proposed consent order be entered, unless substantive adverse comments are received during the public comment period.” The EGLE accepted comments from the public from June 24 to July 24 and will make a determination of whether a public hearing is necessary depending on the comments received.

url: https://thedailynews.cc/articles/gardening-for-the-novice-what-is-a-rain-garden/
 Thursday, March 19, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan By The Daily News Staff | on April 27, 2019 “If we had no Winter, the Spring would not be so pleasant.” — Anne Bradstreet, Early English Poet of North America (1612-1672) BACKGROUND This Spring my Columns will be featuring answers to questions on Gardening topics that are of interest to local gardeners. One popular topic we will begin with is “What is a Rain Garden?” DEFINITION Professor Leonard Perry, University of Vermont Extension explains, “Rain Gardens are actually slightly sunken gardens, usually with native plants, whose purpose is to collect rain run-off.” The run-off will soak into the rain garden soil instead of draining off your property carrying along with it contaminants that will pollute our local waterways. NEED Most of the above ground waterways in our area are polluted. These waterways include streams, creeks, ponds, rivers and lakes in our community. Almost three-quarters of this pollution comes from stormwater. About half of this stormwater drains off of our garden landscapes and building roofs. This pollution consists of pesticides and other chemicals, oil, gas and many other everyday contaminants, which are toxic to our environment. A rain garden on your property as part of your landscape gardens is a great way to help reduce this pollution BASICS A tried and true way to determine the best location for your rain garden is for you to go outdoors during a heavy rain — dress appropriately, of course — and see first hand how the rainwater flows on your property, where it collects and where it exits your property to drains, sewers, streams, etc. From your observations, you will be able to tell where to place your rain garden. It will most likely be in in a low area where the rainwater already collects allowing it to seep into the garden soil rather than running off of your property. As a general rule, rain gardens are usually shallow, around six inches deep in most cases. This will allow the water tolerant plants in the garden to survive periods of heavy rain. The rain garden bed should be flat to allow any stormwater to seep into the rain garden soil uniformly. Ideally, your rain garden should be near drain spouts but not too close to your home or garage, which would allow water to seep into basement areas. Other areas of concerns include avoiding underground utilities when digging and staying clear of any trees to prevent damaging their roots. Your rain garden doesn’t have to have a large surface area to be effective. You will know if your rain garden is doing its job if the stormwater drains within 12 hours or up to one day, at the longest. SOIL TYPE The most important feature of a rain garden is to allow water that it captures to slowly seep into its soil. In the garden, soil types are based upon soil texture, which is quite simply the way the soil feels in your hands. The soil texture is the result of the various soil particles found. The water holding capacity of the soil, its rate of drainage, and its ability to hold nutrients, are all directly related to its texture. Clay soil is made up of small particles and feels sticky, sandy soil is made up of larger particles and feels gritty and loam soils are a mixture of different size soil particles. For your rain garden, loam soils are ideal. Fortunately, for most area gardeners the Montcalm County website (www.montcalm.org) indicates that approximately 75% off the soil in Montcalm County consists of sandy loam. You don’t want clay soil in your rain garden, which will not allow the water to readily seep through. It is better to have loam soil even if you have to replace the existing soil. If needed, the replacement soil should be about 2 feet deep. A smart way to find out the makeup of your garden soil is to run samples with the MSU Extension Soil Test Kit that you can obtain online from the MSUE Bookstore, www.bookstore.msue.msu.edu NATIVE PLANTS We have discussed the value of Michigan native plants in several of our Gardening for the Novice Columns and have reviewed Michigan native plants in detail in the May 2018 Column. Michigan native plants should be the principal plants in the rain garden you build. They are well adapted to our area’s soil, climate and wildlife and can be used to create a beautiful and very effective, native rain garden. The native plants’ large root systems will allow the rainwater to penetrate the rain garden soil and minimize any runoff. For a comprehensive listing of West Michigan native plants for use in your rain gardens, search West Michigan Rain Gardens online. Native trees, shrubs, grasses and wildflowers favoring wet to moist, as well as moist to dry conditions, are all included in this comprehensive listing. Some native plants we had had success growing locally include coral bells, purple coneflower, black-eyed Susan, switchgrass and juneberry trees. MAINTENANCE Many people are under the impression that rain gardens are maintenance free — they are not. As with other native landscape gardens, they require clean up, weeding and mulching, on a regular basis. Pesticides, fungicides and herbicides should not be used around or near your rain gardens to minimize contamination problems. MORE INFO We have tried to cover the basics of rain gardens. Much more information can be found on the web. A US Dept. of Agriculture Bulletin on Rain Gardens goes over it in more detail — benefits, design, building and maintaining the garden.

url: https://thedailynews.cc/articles/health-officials-assure-orleans-township-residents-water-is-safe-but-still-looking-for-pfas-source/
 Thursday, March 19, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan By Meghan Nelson | on September 20, 2018 ORLEANS TOWNSHIP — The Michigan Department of Health & Human Services (MDHHS) offered Orleans Township residents a chemistry lesson Tuesday night on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS, to help them understand the contamination found within their community. Bill Ferrell, a toxicologist with the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services response section, gave Orleans Township residents a chemistry lesson on what PFAS is and how levels are calculated during Tuesday’s Orleans Township Board meeting. — DN Photo | Meghan Nelson MDHHS officials, along with the Ionia County Health Department and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) attended the Orleans Township Board meeting to update and reassure residents about PFAS test results within the community. Ionia County Health Officer and Director of Environmental Health Ken Bowen explained there are 3,000 different PFAS compounds, all of which are man-made and don’t occur naturally in the environment. However, they are ubiquitous and found in household items, such as cookware, technology, apparel and any item meant to resist heat, oils, grease, stains or water. Their widespread use along with pollution have introduced them into the environment where they don’t degrade. Bill Ferrell, a toxicologist with the MHDDS response section, explained the compound resiliency is due to its atomic makeup. “This carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest bonds, and it gives these chemicals unique characteristics,” Ferrell said. “They are very stable in the environment, and they don’t break down easily. They’re very mobile in the environment, especially in groundwater, and they bioaccumulate in biota, including humans.” Perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), which was found at 200 ppt at EightCAP’s facility, has four carbon-fluorine bonds, while other PFAS compounds, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), have eight of those carbon-fluorine bonds. PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have been recorded in human epidemiological and then tested in animal studies to come up with a reference dose or the acceptable level of daily ingestion for those compounds. According to Ferrell, researchers determined the reference dose for PFOS and PFOA to be 20 nanograms per kilogram per day. That reference dose is used to determine the lifetime health advisory for drinking water by assuming how much water the average person drinks and how much of the compound the daily water intake can safely contain. “If you think back to your old algebra, you know or make assumptions of how much water the person is ingesting and you know what the daily intake is. You rearrange it and solve for the drinking water concentration,” Ferrell said. “That’s how they came up with the 70 ppt as the acceptable lifetime health advisory.” The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not currently have a lifetime health advisory for PFBS, but it does have a reference dose of 20,000 nanograms per kilogram per day — a thousand times higher than the combined reference dose for PFOA and PFOS. Ferrell said PFBS’s higher reference dose, which means a lower toxicity level, may be attributed to the small chain size and low half-life (the rate at which a chemical decrease by half) of PFBS in blood. PFBS has a half-life of 28 days compared to 2.1 to 10.1 years for PFOA and 2.1 to 27 years for PFOS. “Based on this information, given the low half-life of PFBS relative to PFOS and PFOA as well as the relative toxicity as exhibited by the reference doses, the DHHS has concluded the concentration of PFBS of 200 ppt does not pose a public health risk,” Ferrell said. Although health officials said local water is most likely safe to consume, they are still looking for the source of the PFBS contamination. Aaron Assmann, an environmental quality analyst with the MDEQ, explained he uses several tools such as Environmental Mapper, which is available to the public at www.mcgi.state.mi.us/environmentalmapper, to look for potential sources of contamination. “When we get new info like this, we typically do a table-top review,” he explained. “We look at our databases. We look for industrial operations in the area. We look for possible confirmed releases whether they’re gasoline releases or other compounds we consider to be hazardous materials.” Looking for any link to a PFAS leak, Assmann said he couldn’t find one. He found underground gasoline storage tanks, including two which is registered as leaking and removed. Gasoline isn’t linked to PFAS plumes, and the confirmed release was closed in 1995. “There were a few complaints, but none of them really stood out to me,” Assmann said. “There’s not really a solid silver bullet PFAS source I found near that site.” Assmann and Abigail Hendershott, the district supervisor for the MDEQ’s remediation and redevelopment division, admitted they’re working from Grand Rapids and don’t know Orleans Township, as well as residents, do. “If you do know of information we should know, please, let us know,” Hendershott said. Several residents mentioned nearby Pitsch Landfill, which they said has had problems in the past. According to Hendershott, active landfills are up next for PFAS testing and she added she will work with her waste management division colleagues at the MDEQ to learn more about Pitsch Landfill. In the meantime, although the PFBS contamination is believed to be safe for residents to drink, health officials recognize it may still worry residents and gave options to abate their fears. Hendershott said she personally feels comfortable installing a National Science Foundation certified three-stage carbon filter under her kitchen sink to remove any potential PFOA or PFOS contamination and are likely to remove other PFAS compounds. Bowen said if he was an Orleans Township resident, he would look into testing his water, which can cost between $250 and $500. But he acknowledged it’s an individual choice. “The million dollar question everyone wants to ask is if it’s safe,” Bowen said. “You’re going to find when you ask a health official if something is safe they get pretty squirrelly. We don’t like to say things are safe because we say it is safe and then something changes tomorrow. “I’m being told by MHHDS this chemical at this level is not a health concern,” he added. “That being said, I’ll also tell you from a health perspective, it should not be in the water, which is why we’re going to continue to investigate it.” Hendershott reassured residents the MDEQ isn’t done with Orleans Township. As the MDEQ continues to receive more information over the next year, she said they will continue to update residents. You must be logged in to post a comment. Our Hometown

 By Staff | on July 27, 2017 The Central Michigan District Health Department (CMDHD) is conducting a bathing beach monitor­ing program of public beaches in the six county district which includes Roscommon County, as well as the counties of Arenac, Clare, Gladwin, Isabella and Osceola. According to a press release from the CMDHD’s Environmental Health Services Division, for more than 16 years, the CMDHD has conducted a bathing beach monitor­ing program of public beaches in the six-county district. (This year it is also partnering with the Midland County Health Department to assist in monitoring select beaches in Mid­land County.) “Although funding continues to be limited, CMDHD will be able to monitor the most heavily used beaches and the beaches most vul­nerable to contamination in our ser­vice area. Beaches that are open to the public but not part of our moni­toring program, including smaller beaches, campgrounds, and chil­dren’s camps, have been asked by the health department to either im­plement a water sampling program that meets the state standards or post notices at the beaches to inform the public whether or not the water has been tested for E. coli bacteria,” CMDHD Director of Environmental Health Services Steve King said. “If you don’t see a posting at a public beach advising whether the beach is monitored and how to find the results of testing, you should con­tact the beach manager or local mu­nicipality responsible for the beach to request they post the beach,” King said. Surface waters contaminated with elevated levels of E. coli bacteria can result in flu-like symptoms includ­ing nausea, vomiting, stomachache, diarrhea, headache and fever. Other minor illnesses associated with swimming in contaminated wa­ters include ear, eye, nose and throat infections and skin rashes. In highly polluted waters, swimmers run the risk of exposure to more serious disease causing organisms such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, E. coli O157, Norovirus and Shigella. “By monitoring our public swim­ming areas throughout the sum­mer season, we can promote public safety by warning of high levels of harmful bacteria,” King said. In order to close or post an advi­sory for a beach, the data results for E.coli contamination must exceed 300 E.coli/100 mLs of water for one single sampling event. The closure or advisory is lifted after the results from sampling indicated levels of E.coli have fallen below the contam­ination level. When it comes to making a per­sonal decision as to which beaches to spend summer days on, keep in mind the following tips: • Large amounts of waterfowl present (geese or ducks) could mean an increased amount of “bird drop­pings” which may contain high con­centrations of E. coli bacteria (there may also be a higher risk of swim­mer’s itch). • A person should not swim in public beaches if he or she has open sores or lesions on his or her body. • Research the number of closings the beach has had in the most recent years by visiting www.cmdhd.org, Public Beach Monitoring. • If there has been a heavy rain event within the past 48 hours, use caution in swimming due to possible runoff and higher levels of bacteria in the water. • If the water is discolored with a greenish, blue or milky appearance, this may indicate an algae bloom. Certain algae blooms can produce toxins that could make someone ill. • Public beaches that are used by a large number of people, especially small children, could contain body fluids and fecal matter. • Do not swim where the beach has an overabundance of trash and litter. • Dry off immediately with a clean towel after getting out of the water. Remember to use sunscreen and take precautions against sun­burn. It is also a good idea to take a shower after spending a day at the beach. • Wash your hands with soap and water before eating.

This program is made available through funds from the Department of Environmental Quality, the Clean Michigan Initiative, Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the Sagi­naw Chippewa Indian Tribe.

 By Staff | on June 15, 2017 1.7-OUNCE MONSTER Five-year-old Stevie Bednarik looks on as St. Helen Lake Association President John Bawol weighs the 1.7-ounce bluegill she caught at Lake St. Helen during Free Fishing Weekend. Her father, Steve Bednarik, took Stevie and his son, Degen (left), to have their catches weighed at the weigh-in station at the Richfield Township Lake St. Helen Access Park as part of Roscommon County’s Michigan’s Other Great Lakes Family Fishing Fest June 10. Degen caught a 10.2 ounce sunfish. FISHING WITH FAMILY David Nieman gives his son, Xavier, some words of encouragement June 10 as the two fished at the Houghton Lake South Shore Department of Natural Resources Boat Launch at part of Free Fishing Weekend. “He out fishes me sometimes, don’t you buddy,” Nieman said of his son. FISHING IN THE PARK Three-year-old Carter Cunning­ham, the son of Ron and Michele Cunningham of Millington, sang a fishing song he made up while fishing for plastic fish at Lyon Township’s Park 27 June 10. The Friends of Lyon Township hosted vendors, a bake sale, games and fishing related events at Park 27 as part of Michigan’s Other Great Lakes Family Fishing Fest during the Department of Natural Resources’ Free Fishing Weekend. HOUGHTON LAKE BASS Paul Spindler of Zeeland shows off the 3.21-pound, 17 1/2-inch largemouth bass he caught June 10. Spindler had the fish weighed at the Houghton Lake South Shore Department of Natural Resources Boat Launch as part of Michigan’s Other Great Lakes Family Fishing Fest in conjunction with the DNR’s Free Fish­ing Weekend. GOING FISHING Matthew Rogers shows off his fishing hat while playing at Lyon Township’s Park 27 June 10. His mother, Missy Rogers, of Newaygo, said that her son caught a five- inch, three-ounce bass earlier in the day. “When I said we were going [fishing], he wanted to catch the smallest fish and I think he did,” Missy said. She added the bass was caught at Marl Lake. WINNER (Left) Cameron Baker, the son of Amber McMillen of Houghton Lake, picks out rubber worms as his casting contest prize during Michigan’s Other Great Lakes Family Fishing Fest June 10 at the Richfield Township Lake St. Helen Access Park. Kathy Jernigan (left) said the prizes for the day were donated by the St. Helen Lake Association, snacks were provided by Jan Waltz and water was donated by Mercantile Bank. PEACEFUL MORNING FISHING Randy Franks casts his line the morning of June 10 at the shore of the Richfield Township Lake St. Helen Access Park. CLEAN WATER ALL AROUND As residents of Michigan, Educator and Naturalist Tom Dale told students at Lake Saver Day June 9 that people are accustomed to having an abundance of clean, cold and safe water surrounding them and it has become “our way of life” to have access to fresh water. For people around the world, Dale said access to fresh water is not always the case. He told them how President Jimmy Carter had helped to erradicate the spread of Guinea worm, which Dale said people ingest by drinking unclean water. He said Carter promoted the use of drinking water through a screen to help people around the world from ingesting the Guinea worm. THIS WAY (From left) Fourth graders Kend­yl Frydrych and Alexia Humphrey figure out their next checkpoint during a compass course taught by Don Correll and Rick Meeks. LAKEFRONT CLASSROOM Darcia Little (right) and Mike Ravesi (second from right) of the Camp Grayling Environmental Office teach Roscommon Middle School fourth graders about the water cycle and why it’s important to keep earth’s water clean during Lake Saver Day June 9. During a pollutant demonstration, Little used a bowl to repre­sent a body of water. She then described types of water pollutants and then asked the students to pour those pollutants into the bowl. One of the pollutants she discussed was oil, which the students used maple syrup to represent oil being dumped in a body of water. Lake Saver Day is designed to teach fourth graders about the importance of water conservation and preservation through teaching methods of lake stewardship. The students also toured a boat wash, learned about water safety from the Roscommon County Sheriff’s Office Marine Patrol, learned about erosion, what a watershed is and were given a police water equipment demon­stration by the Gerrish Township Police Department. (Photos by Krista Tacey-Cater) RELIABLE TECHNOLOGY As part of the Higgins Lake Foundation’s Lake Saver Day June 9, Rick Meeks (right) taught a compass course to RMS fourth graders. Meeks told the students to use the skills they were taught and not be fooled by the clues they were given when finding their next course check point as it was a bit tricky. Meeks said that learning to use a compass is a valuable skill to teach children as it is a reliable tool. He said GPS and cell phones aren’t always reliable in the woods and having the skills to use a compass can come in handy. “This always works,” Meeks said of a compass.

 By Staff | on March 30, 2017 President Obama had increased funds to the Great Lakes by over $300 million while Mitt Romney said absolutely nothing in support of the Great Lakes, not only in Asian Carp issues but also in environmental and pollution problems. Donald Trump proposed to cut 97% of funding from the Great Lakes project so Moolenaar is going to kindly ask President Trump to walk his proposal back while criticizing our past president. Trump’s plan would have only given $10 million in funds. Why wasn’t Moolenaar just as critical of his? My, my, it’s all President Obama’s fault in healthcare and on the Asian Carp problems. Oh no, not Republicans. Well let me fully explain facts to Rep. Moolenaar. Asian Carp have been an issue for over 40 years. Asian Carp were brought here in the 1970s and have since traveled up the Mississippi River north from southern state districts. Illinois Department of Natural Resources had taken as many as 80,000 to 100,000 pounds in a given week through all kinds of methods. So must I remind Moolenaar that Chicago is in Illinois, where his sarcasm was directed. President Obama, Republicans and 80% of Ohio Democrats agreed on the importance of restoring the Great Lakes. They were not contained in the south. Now they run rampant to the north, northeast through Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, even Canada, leading right into our rivers. Must I also remind Moolenaar of the Republican Great Recession that ruined our economy which curtailed and crippled many of the proposals President Obama would loved to have completed. President Trump never faced that reality but still recommended cuts to the Great Lakes region. May I also remind Moolenaar that President Obama was not born when our industrial companies polluted our rivers, our Great Lakes and still coal companies were polluting rivers from overflowed coal ash ponds. Those southern states did nothing to stop those events from happening until they were stopped by the EPA, forcing one company to close through lawsuits. Rep. Moolenaar should have been more responsive to the Flint Water Crisis that is still ongoing. President Obama did not run Michigan, but Governor Rick Snyder, City Manager of Flint and Republican representatives did. I guess that President Trump feels the border wall is more important to him rather than the Great Lakes region or even Meals on Wheels. Rep. Moolenaar needs to go beyond just his critical views. Get on with work in all aspects of Michigan issues. President Obama is gone now, you’re still here. David S. Walenski St. Helen Your email address will not be published.

(Courtesy photo)Over the course of Lake Saver Day, which was held June 3 at the Ralph A. MacMullan Conference Center, Bolz­man told the current fourth graders that he participated in the first Lake Saver Day in 2008. As a senior Bolzman said he remembers going to Lake Saver Day and the presentation that stuck with him the most was “the bowl.” THE FIRST LAKE SAVER DAY RJ Bolzman and the rest of Mrs. Mary Jo Mayes 2008 fourth grade class are pictured at the first Lake Saver Day with Sgt. Greg Patchin of the Gerrish Township Police Department. Bolzman is in the back row, second to the right of Patchin. (Courtesy photo) During that particular presentation, a large bowl was used to represent Higgins Lake. The bowl was then polluted with items that were meant to represent oil, trash, chemicals and dirt. Once the bowl had all the items in it, the bowl’s water was filled with pollutants. That presentation Bolzman said has stuck with him for the last nine years. “Being at the first one (Lake Saver Day) built on my passion for environ­mental studies,” Bolzman said. He said that he hopes when fourth graders come to Lake Saver Day that they too take on the same passion for keeping bodies of water clean. “I think other schools should do this,” Bolzman added. Bolzman, who graduated from Gray­ling High School on June 5 plans to at­tend Kirtland Community College to ob­tain an associate degree in business, then transfer to Western Michigan University to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in freshwater sciences and sustainability. Although he is undecided on his final ca­reer, Bolzman said it will be in the field of water sciences. He is currently working on obtaining his divemaster certificate and is already a master diver. This summer Bolzman will be working with the HLF obtain­ing water samples and spending time on the foundation’s Diver Assisted Suc­tion Harvester (DASH) boat. He will be diving to harvest Eurasian watermilfoil from Higgins Lake in an effort to remove the invasive species from the lake. While speaking to the students, Bol­zman told them that his “passion” for Higgins Lake and water sustainability started at Lake Saver Day. He encour­aged the students to listen to the presen­tations as they too may find their love for water sciences could start at Lake Saver Day. Bolzman’s mother, Ann, who is the HLF’s administrative assistant, is not surprised that her son is going to study water sciences. Growing up, Ann said that Higgins Lake was always special for her and she wanted him to have the same passion for the lake as she does. “He was baptized in Higgins Lake,” Ann said. She “insisted” he be baptized there and noted that action shows the im­portance of the lake to her family. She added that she is “really excited” to see her son go into water sciences be­cause she sees the importance of having those who care for the future of bodies of water. “…I am so proud of RJ. I was hoping he would go in this direction as the lake and our natural resources are something I brought him up to respect. I started teaching him at a young age how impor­tant these resources are and, any time we went out on Higgins Lake, we always kept an eye out for garbage in the water and carried a net so we could pick it up,” Ann wrote in a June 7 email. “When he was old enough to go out by himself he would come back and show me all the trash he had gotten. Lake Saver Day was an important part of reinforcing what I had been tell­ing him. I hope he goes on to save the planet from ourselves but if he chooses another path I will be proud of whatever he decides.” In addition to hearing from Bolz­man, the fourth graders participated in a compass course given by HLF members Dan Correll and Rick Meeks, a water cycle presentation by Darcia Little of the Camp Grayling Environmental Of­fice, a Higgins Lake history presentation by educator Tom Dale, an erosion pre­sentation by Michigan State University Extension Forester Julie Crick, a water table demonstration by Dylan Goodell and Emma Fojtik of Huron Pines and a police equipment demonstration by the Gerrish Township Police Department.

url: https://www.ironmountaindailynews.com/news/local-news/2020/02/wisconsin-assembly-passes-bill-on-pfas-pollution/
 Feb 21, 2020 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Assembly Republicans hastily put together a bill addressing PFAS contamination and pushed it through to the Senate early Friday morning, just moments before adjourning for the year. The bill gives Rep. John Nygren of Marinette cover on the campaign trail this summer. His northeastern Wisconsin district has been hit hard by PFAS groundwater pollution. PFAS are man-made chemicals that research suggests can decrease female fertility, increase the risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women and lower birth weights. The chemicals have been used for decades in a range of products, including firefighting foam, nonstick cookware, fast-food wrappers and stain-resistant sprays. Nygren and Democratic state Sen. Dave Hansen of Green Bay put together a sweeping bill addressing PFAS contamination in January that called for emergency rules limiting the amount of PFAS in ground and surface water as well as air emissions, grants for municipalities to address PFAS pollution, sampling wildlife for contamination and free blood testing for people living near polluted areas in Marinette, Peshtigo and Porterfield. The measure sputtered out amid pushback from powerful business groups, including Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the Wisconsin Dairy Alliance and the Wisconsin Paper Council. Nygren said on the Assembly floor Friday morning that the bill’s opponents used “scare tactics” to frighten people into thinking the proposal would cost jobs. He also said it was difficult to gather legislative support for the bill since PFAS contamination is more of a local problem than a statewide issue. Still, he convinced his fellow Republicans during a break in debate on other bills to let him amend a measure setting bidding requirements for lake rehabilitation projects to address PFAS. The amendment would require a new University of Wisconsin System freshwater collaborative to study PFAS pollution and report back to the Legislature by Jan. 1. The Assembly passed a bill earlier this week laying out funding for the collaborative. That measure is now in the Senate. The Department of Natural Resources would have to develop emergency rules for certifying laboratories to test for the presence of PFAS; test for PFAS in municipal water systems and private wells near contaminated sites and provide clean drinking water for people in those areas; and request whatever money it needs to address PFAS in the next state budget. Nygren acknowledged the amendment doesn’t go nearly as far as the bill that he and Hansen crafted but said, “I don’t want to walk away from this opportunity without providing some answers … and some certainty for my constituents.” Democrats lobbied Republicans to pass the original bill to no avail. In the end the chamber approved the amendment on a voice vote. They passed the bill on a 62-35 party line vote moments before Republican leaders ended the floor period and with it the Assembly’s work for the year.

 Jan 31, 2020 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Two northeastern Wisconsin lawmakers introduced sweeping legislation Thursday designed to curb water and air pollution from man-made chemicals known as PFAS. Rep. John Nygren, a Marinette Republican, and Sen. Dave Hansen, a Green Bay Democrat, have been working on the package for months in a rare display of bipartisanship on a major issue in Madison’s toxic political world. Each lawmaker’s district includes both the Marinette and Peshtigo areas, which have been hard hit with PFAS pollution believed to have originated from firefighting foam. Tyco Fire Products, a unit of Johnson Controls, discovered in 2013 that soil and well contamination on its Marinette fire training property contained PFAS. Four years later, the company acknowledged that the chemicals had spread beyond the facility. “Unfortunately, Marinette and Peshtigo have become the epicenter of PFAS contamination in Wisconsin,” Nygren said in a video posted on his Twitter account. “While we are still learning about these chemicals, it’s important we act quickly to keep them from entering our drinking water. This bill will be a significant step forward.” PFAS are man-made chemicals that research suggests can decrease female fertility, increase the risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women and lower birth weights. The chemicals have been used for decades in a range of products, including firefighting foam, non-stick cookware, fast food wrappers and stain-resistant sprays. The chemicals have drawn more scrutiny in recent years as potentially toxic contaminants in ground and surface water. The new bill would allocate $7.7 million over the biennium toward efforts to slow contamination and clean up polluted areas. The legislation would provide $5 million to create new grants for municipalities to address PFAS contamination when the polluting party is unknown, can’t be found or can’t pay for remediation. The money could also be used to investigate potential PFAS pollution or discharges. The state Department of Natural Resources would get $1 million to test water systems for PFAS pollution, $150,000 to sample wildlife for PFAS contamination and $120,000 to provide temporary drinking water or treatment system when a party responsible for contamination isn’t available. The University of Wisconsin System, meanwhile, would get $250,000 to research ways to destroy PFAS. All of the money would come out of the state’s environmental fund. The DNR would be required to put emergency rules in place establishing PFAS limits for groundwater and set out surface water, drinking water and air emission standards. Democrat Tony Evers already has ordered the DNR to establish permanent groundwater and surface water standards for PFAS, but that process could take years. Nygren said the department could put emergency rules in place much faster. State health officials would be required to offer free blood testing by September to people living near PFAS-contaminated sites in Marinette, the Peshtigo area and Porterfield. Polluters would have to reimburse the costs. Health officials also would have to conduct a cancer study in those areas. The bill also would create a new trust fund to hold money the state wins in PFAS-related litigation. The measure’s prospects look uncertain. Aides for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald didn’t immediately reply to messages inquiring about the bill’s chances in each chamber. Time is running out; both houses expect to wrap up their two-year sessions by March. Nygren said in a phone interview that he had spoken with Vos and Fitzgerald and that he’s optimistic both chambers will hold votes on the bill. Evers issued a statement saying he hopes the bill will reach his desk so he can sign it into law. The bill comes a little more than a week after the Legislature passed another Nygren bill restricting the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS. That measure is sitting on Evers desk. His spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, didn’t return a message asking if the governor would sign it.

 Jun 10, 2019 MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Wisconsin company failed to report the release of hazardous materials at a property in Marinette that resulted in some residents unknowingly drinking contaminated water for years, the state Department of Natural Resources said. The DNR has referred the matter to the state Department of Justice for civil prosecution, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The agency alleges a unit of Glendale, Wis.-based Johnson Controls failed to inform state officials it knew that so-called forever chemicals had been found at a fire training facility in northeastern Wisconsin and did not take steps to minimize their impact. Johnson Controls said in a statement Friday it believed the contamination was confined to its property and it wasn’t obligated to notify authorities when the chemicals were first detected. Johnson Controls’ Tyco Fire Products uses the perfluorinated chemicals in the manufacture of fire retardants. For decades, the compounds have been an essential ingredient in firefighting chemicals and have been used at its training site on the edge of town. The chemicals resist breaking down in the environment and have been discovered in private wells in the Marinette area. They also have been found in trace levels in the municipal water system, and they have turned up in local streams and offshore in Green Bay. Epidemiology studies that were cited in a federal report last year suggested that the compounds can lead to increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, liver damage, thyroid disease, asthma, decreased fertility, some cancers and a drop in responses to vaccines. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in February that state records showed that Tyco had test results of soil and well contamination from the chemicals on its property dating back to October 2013 as part an effort to remove long-standing gasoline compounds from the property. In November 2017, Tyco reported that it believed the chemicals had spread outside its 380-acre fire technology center, where testing and training have gone on since at least 1962. The following month, the company began distributing bottled water to residents whose private wells might have been affected. Tyco and Johnson Controls are currently providing bottled water to 125 residents. The companies have installed 38 water treatment systems on properties. Douglas Oitzinger, a former mayor of Marinette, said Tyco should have responded quicker. “If you have a forest fire going on your property, you don’t assume that it’s not going to jump to the neighbors’ property and you don’t report it,” Oitzinger said. The pollution problems first came to light under the industry-friendly administration of Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who was replaced in January by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. “I don’t know if this reflects a normal process, or if this is attributed to a change in administrations,” Oitzinger said. “But I think it was pretty clear cut that Johnson Controls, or Tyco at the time, had an obligation to report this in 2013 and they didn’t do it.” IRON MOUNTAIN — The Dickinson County Road Commission remains on the job but steps are being taken to help lessen ...

 Apr 8, 2019 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Two of Wisconsin’s most polluted sites on the Great Lakes are marking cleanup milestones, after the state Department of Natural Resources declared both waterways to be no longer impaired. The Lower Menominee River and the St. Louis River are among five areas in the state designated as Areas of Concern and featured on a list of most contaminated sites on the Great Lakes. The department removed impairment designations for the two rivers in February, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. The Lower Menominee River was listed for arsenic, coal tar, oil and grease pollution. The river originally had six out of 14 types of impairment classifications set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The removal of the site’s last remaining impairment for degraded fish and wildlife populations could result in its removal from the Great Lakes contamination list this year. It would become the first site in Wisconsin to be removed from the list, said Kendra Axness, Area of Concern and Lakewide Action and Management Plan policy coordinator with the Wisconsin DNR. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative , which was launched by former President Barack Obama, has provided about $300 million each year for cleanup efforts around the Great Lakes since 2010. The initiative has been vital to the restoration progress, Axness said. “The acceleration of the progress that’s been accomplished by the GLRI is really astounding,” she said. “I hope we get to continue to keep doing this good work because I think we’re making really good progress.” The impairment against the St. Louis River was removed after scientists confirmed that the health of the river’s fish population has improved, the DNR said. Scientists conducted multiple studies of the river from 2011 to 2015. Researchers found that less than 5% of the roughly 620 white suckers that were examined had skin or liver tumors, a rate lower than elsewhere in the Great Lakes, said Matt Steiger, St. Louis River AOC coordinator with the DNR. “The sucker is an important food source for a lot of other game fish that people are out there pursuing,” said Steiger. “If that’s a healthy population, we can hope that’s reciprocated through other sought-after species in the estuary.” IRON MOUNTAIN — The Dickinson County Road Commission remains on the job but steps are being taken to help lessen ...

 Jun 19, 2018 MARINETTE, Wis. (AP) — A manufacturer in northeastern Wisconsin has discovered new evidence of groundwater pollution near Lake Michigan involving a chemical that has raised national health concerns. Tyco Fire Products said this month that it discovered perfluorinated chemicals, or PFCs, in well samples at its manufacturing plant in Marinette. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had directed Tyco to test for PFCs at the wells, which are part of a separate cleanup of arsenic. Tyco produces specialized firefighting foams that can extinguish gas and oil fires. PFCs are used in products like the firefighting foam and have been linked with increasing cancer risks and development problems in fetuses, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported . Tyco, which is a unit of Johnson Controls International, said it’s investigating the source and extent of the groundwater contamination by testing soil, ditches and surface water. Elevated levels of PFCs appeared in Marinette’s wastewater treatment system during November and May testing, according to records from the city and the Department of Natural Resources. Effluent is released into the river after waste is treated. The leftover sludge has typically been spread on farm fields. The DNR has directed the city to test the sludge samples and officials are waiting for the lab results. It’s uncertain if Tyco is the source of the wastewater contamination and it’s too early to determine the impact of the sludge on soil, crops and livestock, according to DNR officials. Trace amounts of the chemicals have also been found in the city’s municipal drinking water, according to records from the city and the DNR. The levels are low and aren’t considered a danger to public health, city and DNR officials said. Johnson Controls spokesman Fraser Engerman said since PFC compounds are often used in consumer and commercial products, “it is difficult to determine all potential sources of these compounds.” IRON MOUNTAIN — The Dickinson County Road Commission remains on the job but steps are being taken to help lessen ...

url: https://www.ironmountaindailynews.com/opinion/2017/08/study-fines-for-illegal-pollution-down-under-trump/
 Aug 11, 2017 WASHINGTON (AP) — Fines for illegal pollution have plummeted under President Donald Trump, according to analysis by an environmental advocacy group. The Environmental Integrity Project looked at civil penalties paid by polluters during the first six months under Trump. The group published an analysis Thursday that found penalties were less than half their levels under each of the past three presidents. The analysis found Trump’s Justice Department settled 26 civil cases against companies over environmental violations, totaling $12 million in penalties. That’s a 60 percent drop on average from comparable time periods under presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush or Bill Clinton, even before adjustments for inflation. Besides reaching fewer settlements, the group said, environmental offenders also were required to perform less cleanup under Trump and make smaller reductions to future pollution. The report’s authors cautioned that six months represent only an eighth of a presidential term but said the early news is neither encouraging nor surprising. Trump and his Environmental Enforcement Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, have complained that federal regulations are often too onerous and stifle the growth of American businesses. “President Trump campaigned on a promise of ‘law and order,’ but apparently law enforcement for big polluters is not what he had in mind,” Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement. He previously served as director of EPA’s civil enforcement office under both Clinton and Bush. Under the first six months under Obama, the Justice Department brought 34 civil cases for violations of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and other federal environmental laws, with polluters agreeing to pay $36 million in penalties. Bush logged 31 cases with $30 million in penalties, while Clinton accounted for 45 cases with $25 million in penalties. The group did not include settlements for pollution cleanups agreed to as part of the federal Superfund program, cases that can often drag on for decades. The comparison between presidential administrations is more stark when figures are adjusted for inflation. For example, the $25 million in civil penalties under Clinton in the first half of 1992 would equal more than $43.5 million in today’s dollars. A Justice Department spokesman said figures for civil penalties do not tell the full story because they do not include fines from criminal prosecutions. “The department continues to vigorously enforce environmental laws to better protect the American people,” said Mark Abueg, a Justice public affairs specialist. “For example, in just the last six months, (we) filed major new Clean Air Act litigation and obtained a $40 million criminal penalty in a vessel pollution case that safeguards the environment.” The $40 million fine Abueg cited was finalized in April as part of the sentencing of Princess Cruise Lines over the illegal dumping and concealment of oil-contaminated waste from its ships. However, the settlement, the largest ever in such a case, was actually negotiated under the Obama administration and announced in December — the month before Trump took office — as part of the company’s guilty plea to felony crimes in federal court.

 Feb 28, 2020 TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — A Michigan oversight panel Thursday endorsed drinking water standards designed to limit exposure to a group of household and industrial chemicals linked to a variety of health problems. The proposed rules would apply to seven compounds in a category known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. They have been used for decades in products ranging from nonstick cookware to stain-resistant clothing and food containers, as well as foam used to extinguish jet-fuel fires. They’re known as “forever chemicals” because they persist indefinitely in the environment without breaking down. Members of Congress announced Thursday the Air Force would spend $13.5 million cleaning up PFAS water pollution near the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, Michigan. Thousands of PFAS compounds have been developed. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy crafted drinking water standards for just seven because they’re the only ones for which there is enough scientific data to justify regulation, spokesman Scott Dean said. Their acceptance by the Environmental Rules Review Committee was a key step. The state legislature established the panel in 2018 at the urging of Republicans who described it as a check on excessively burdensome regulation. Among its members are representatives of business and industry sectors including oil and gas, agriculture and manufacturing. At their urging, the panel delayed action on the PFAS rules last fall. But it approved the proposals Thursday on a 8-0 vote, with two members abstaining. The decision “shows there is broad support for rules that protect Michiganders from contaminants in their drinking water,” said Liesl Clark, director of the environment department. The rules still need approval of the legislature’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules before taking effect. They would cover about 2,700 drinking water systems, requiring them to conduct periodic testing and inform the public of results. The environment department forwarded its proposals to the oversight panel last October. The panel considered them in two meetings and took public feedback. While the overwhelming majority of written comments were supportive, some raised concern about the costs of meeting the standards or said the rules were put together too quickly. Smaller drinking water suppliers “don’t have the ability to pass that cost along on any non-painful way to ratepayers,” Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau, said during Thursday’s meeting in Lansing. John Dulmes, executive director of the Michigan Chemistry Council, said the department hadn’t provided enough scientific justification for some of the provisions. Panel member Grant Trigger, an engineer who manages cleanups of former General Motors properties, questioned whether the standards, although designed for drinking water, might affect users of PFAS-tainted compost or sewage byproducts known as biosolids. Department officials said they would move slowly on dealing with contaminated soils. The oversight committee agreed to send the legislative rules committee a memo outlining criticisms that had been submitted. But supporters said there was no need for further delay. “None of us sitting at this table are toxicologists,” said Eric Pessell, a member from Delton representing public health professionals. He said the department gave due regard to objections and ran them past a science advisory group but found no reason to adjust the proposed limits. Environmental groups said the limits were essential to safeguard Michigan’s water from the chemicals, which studies have linked to testicular cancer, damage to organs including the liver and kidneys, reproductive system harm. “While we continue to believe that a panel stacked with industry special interests shouldn’t have an oversight role over rules designed to protect our environment and public health, we are glad that the committee took the right step and approved these critical drinking water protections,” said Charlotte Jameson, a program director for the Michigan Environmental Council.

 Apr 28, 2019 LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Scientists want to use an unconventional method to remove pollution at former General Motors properties near Lansing where an underground plume of chemicals is creeping toward drinking water wells. The Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust controls the former GM plants. It is proposing a remediation method called “biosparging,” which removes pollution by injecting air into groundwater. The method encourages bacteria to consume 1,4-dioxane, an industrial chemical that GM used to clean oil off car parts. Should the trust gain state approval, the project would be among the first and likely the largest to use the method, the Lansing State Journal reported . It’s unclear how much the project would cost, but engineers said it could take six to 12 years to fully clean the water. The pollution was discovered after the trust was established by the federal government to take over the GM sites following the company’s bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. The dioxane plume is located under two former GM plants in Lansing Township and Lansing. Dave Favero, deputy cleanup manager for the Michigan properties, said dioxane is very soluble. If dioxane is in oil, as it was used at the GM plants, “it leaches out and starts to migrate with the groundwater,” he said. Long-term exposure could lead to liver, kidney and reproductive problems and possibly cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Lansing-area plume is within the Lansing Board of Water and Light’s wellhead protection area for some of its drinking water wells. Up to 10 of the utility’s wells are downstream from the polluted groundwater. The utility started monitoring for dioxane in 2015, and found a small amount within the limits of what the EPA considers safe. The utility hasn’t monitored dioxane levels that exceed the EPA’s safe limit yet. The trust will need to get approval from state environmental regulators. Scientists and engineers could begin installing biosparging wells this year if the plan is approved.

 Mar 19, 2019 When people are asked to think about the word “health”, thoughts automatically turn inward. They think of their heart or their joints, liver or lungs, associating health with the internal environment, our “innards”, all those organs and vessels. But the external world is a critical component of health. Our environment has an obvious effect on our health, especially when toxins are present. A source of these poisonous substances not often considered is that of the seafood consumed by so many. Recent investigations have shown that humans are being exposed to, and potentially affected by, plastics that have become part of the marine food chain. Only recently has plastic pollution in the oceans become a real concern amongst governments, public service groups, and the general public. In 2013, Americans produced 254 million tons of trash. It works out to roughly four and a half pounds of solid waste produced per person per day, at least in the U.S. Plastics represent approximately ten percent of this mass. Plastics have become an integral part of human society in this age of man. Remember the Stone Age? This may be the Plastic Age. They are certainly important in health care. Some particular benefits in medicine have been their versatility in combination with low cost. This has allowed for mass production and single-use products, clearly more hygienic, disease-preventing. Needless to say, the importance of plastics to society at large is tremendous Plastic, although invented in 1907, went into real production in the sixties. At this point, Americans are producing more plastic trash than ever, and only a small percentage is recycled. Most of the plastic in our oceans came from the land. And there is a lot of it. Over the last few decades, mankind has managed to dump many tons of garbage into the oceans. The total amount of plastics produced in the world in the first decade of this century is equivalent to the total world production in the entire century before. Plastic is everywhere, ubiquitous, nearly omnipresent. And because we want these materials to hold up, they don’t break down. This is a critical part of this topic: plastic’s longevity. It takes thousands of years to decay. Unfortunately, plastics, over time, typically leach out the toxic substances they are composed of. These products are known to persist, polluting the environment for decades, centuries, even millennia. Some end up in landfills. When this happens to plastics, it interacts with water and forms dangerous chemicals. These chemicals can seep underground, thus degrading the water quality. Marine life and wildlife are becoming poisoned, with these toxins entering the food chain. Invariably, this will mean human consumption, threatening human health. In the most polluted places in the ocean, the mass of plastic exceeds the amount of plankton six times over. The largest of these, The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is located in the North Pacific Ocean and is larger than the state of Texas, although similar garbage patches can be found in the Indian and Atlantic Ocean. These islands form as the currents carry the plastic, collecting where the currents meet. Plastics reach the ocean by being blown into the water, picked up by tides, or dumped off platforms and ships. There they gradually break down into ever-smaller pieces termed micro-plastics, due to the action of sunlight exposure, oxidation, the physical action of waves and ocean life. These micro-plastic pieces are recognized to be the most abundant type of plastic in our oceans. Microplastics can now be found almost everywhere looked for, from the beaches and shore-lines to the open ocean, in varying concentrations. If the formation of these micro-plastics wasn’t enough, studies have revealed plastic tends to take up certain persistent, toxic substances present in trace quantities in almost all bodies of water. Consequently, the components of plastics, as well as the chemicals they absorb, can be consumed or taken up by sea life of all sorts. How concerned should we be about marine plastics as far as human health goes? Owing to the many additives contained therein, plastics pose a number of potential human health and environmental risks. Certain components of plastic will affect the human endocrine system, wherein any level of exposure, no matter the route, may be potentially harmful. Of principal concern are hormone-disrupting properties, some of which cause problems with fertility. We need to know whether consumption of plastic debris by marine organisms translates into toxic exposures for people who eat seafood. One question that can’t yet be answered concerns the toxicity of the microplastic particles themselves. Even without considering the chemicals taken up by plastic, these particles can induce abnormal immune system responses, alter gene expression, and cause cell death, amongst other adverse effects. They can pass through the placenta and the blood-brain barrier and can be taken up by the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. And we do not yet have a test that measures human tissues for microplastics. Those plastic components of known adverse health and ecological effects should be removed from the manufacturing process. Some examples include BPA found in polycarbonate food containers and DEHP from medical equipment. The lack of biodegradability, even when considered safe from a toxicological perspective, also demands change. The next-generation of substances will be carbon-neutral monomers that are nontoxic and will be degradable at a rate sufficient to prevent the ongoing accumulation of plastic debris in terrestrial and aquatic environments. We can’t yet say how much plastic, in all its varied forms, is in the ocean. The studies performed to date aren’t able to tell us. We do know that plastic has become almost omni-present on our planet. It has been found on the most remote beaches, collected to form these floating islands, and has been discovered in the bodies of all manner of living creatures, from fish to birds to whales. We do know enough to say it is contributing to the on-going, persistent accumulation of toxic substances in the human diet. The continued production of these durable materials, of limited recyclability, for use as short-lived consumer products is unsustainable. The earth is a closed system. To a single individual, it seems immeasurable, without boundaries. But at this point in human development, we know otherwise. The human population has continued to increase, climbing irrevocably towards eight billion people, nine billion predictable. Can our planet support these numbers, or will we poison ourselves in the process? Typically, the common response to questions of this sort center around the notion technology will save us. Some new invention, or radical new process will enable us to survive and thrive. But with the increasing production and discharge of these substances into this closed system, at some point, past or future, these enduring materials will impact human health. This is in addition to the documented ecological effects. These are substances the human body is not equipped to deal with. What consequences will there be as they filter through the complex system which is Earth’s ecology. Will we see a decrease in fertility or an increase in cancer rates as a result? Or are we already? Many scientists, along with many of the general public are demanding the development of smarter and safer materials for future use. We need to create the next generation of plastics, making them more biodegradable, with a markedly shorter half-life. This will means they won’t accumulate in the oceans, along with less absorption of toxic chemicals. We can’t shield people from all possible exposures, but perhaps we can produce safer chemicals. Hopefully the environment and our health won’t suffer too much in the meantime.

 Apr 22, 2018 In this 2015 photo, Jenna Jambeck, an environment engineering professor at the University of Georgia, holds a plastic baggie with trash collected last fall from a clean up at Panama Beach, Fla., at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in San Jose, Calif. Jambeck calculates that nearly 9 million tons end up in the world’s oceans and on the coastlines each year, as of 2010, according to her 2015 study. (AP photo) By SETH BORENSTEIN AP Science Writer WASHINGTON — Cities and nations are looking at banning plastic straws and stirrers in hopes of addressing the world’s plastic pollution problem. The problem is so large, though, that scientists say that’s not nearly enough. Australian scientists Denise Hardesty and Chris Wilcox estimate, using trash collected on U.S. coastlines during cleanups over five years, that there are nearly 7.5 million plastic straws lying around America’s shorelines. They figure that means 437 million to 8.3 billion plastic straws are on the entire world’s coastlines. But that huge number suddenly seems small when you look at all the plastic trash bobbing around oceans. University of Georgia environmental engineering professor Jenna Jambeck calculates that nearly 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) end up in the world’s oceans and coastlines each year, as of 2010, according to her 2015 study in the journal Science . That’s just in and near oceans. Each year more than 35 million tons (31.9 million metric tons) of plastic pollution are produced around Earth and about a quarter of that ends up around the water. “For every pound of tuna we’re taking out of the ocean, we’re putting two pounds of plastic in the ocean,” says ocean scientist Sherry Lippiatt, California regional coordinator for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s marine debris program. Seabirds can ingest as much as 8 percent of their body weight in plastic, which for humans “is equivalent to the average woman having the weight of two babies in her stomach,” says Hardesty of Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Organizers of Earth Day, which is today, have proclaimed ending plastics pollution this year’s theme. And following in the footsteps of several U.S. cities such as Seattle and Miami Beach, British Prime Minister Theresa May in April called on the nations of the British commonwealth to consider banning plastic straws, coffee stirrers and plastic swabs with cotton on the end. McDonald’s will test paper straws in some U.K. locations next month and keep all straws behind the counter, so customers have to ask for them. “Together with our customers we can do our bit for the environment and use fewer straws,” says Paul Pomroy, who runs the fast-food company’s U.K. business. The issue of straws and marine animals got more heated after a 2015 viral video showing rescuers removing a straw from a sea turtle’s nose in graphic and bloody detail. But a ban may be a bit of a straw man in the discussions about plastics pollution. Straws make up about 4 percent of the plastic trash by piece, but far less by weight. Straws on average weigh so little — about one sixty-seventh of an ounce or .42 grams — that all those billions of straws add up to only about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9 million tons of plastic waste that yearly hits the waters. “Bans can play a role,” says oceanographer Kara Lavendar Law, a co-author with Jambeck of the 2015 Science study. “We are not going to solve the problem by banning straws.” Scientists say that unless you are disabled or a small child, plastic straws are generally unnecessary and a ban is start and good symbol. These items that people use for a few minutes but “are sticking round for our lifetime and longer,” Lippiatt says.

 Sep 11, 2017 PLAINFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — A Superfund landfill suspected of chemically polluting a Michigan water system once accepted toxic sludge from a leather tannery that used the same chemical compounds, according to state records and a former truck driver. Sand Lake resident Earl Tefft told MLive that he regularly drove sludge waste from the Wolverine World Wide tannery to the State Disposal Landfill from 1965 to 1966, while hauling for a local pickup service. Kent County records also state that the company dumped sludge at the landfill during the same period. But the company, in a statement, said that “based on a review of available records, Wolverine does not believe it disposed of material” at the landfill. Wolverine made the Hush Puppies shoe brand using Scotchgard, a stain-and-water repellant that relies on perfluorinated chemicals as its chemical backbone. Those compounds were found in Plainfield Township water in 2013. The water system serves about 40,000 customers. “We’re tracking the (chemicals) from State Disposal to see if it’s the only source, or a source in the Plainfield Township wells,” said Judith Alfano, site manager with the Superfund section at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Alfano didn’t directly point to Wolverine as the source of the chemicals, which the department determined are moving through groundwater toward five township wells at Versluis Park next to the Grand River. Perfluorinated chemicals are no longer manufactured in the U.S. because of health risks. Studies show exposure has been tied to liver disease, thyroid malfunction, pediatric developmental problems and other endocrine and immune system impacts.

 Jul 21, 2015 WILLIS, Mich. (AP) – Two members of Congress from Michigan plan to introduce legislation encouraging Great Lakes states to develop programs that reduce risk of pollution that causes harmful algae blooms. Reps. Tim Walberg of Tipton and Candice Miller of Shelby Township in Macomb County will announce their bill today at a news conference near Willis. It calls for initiatives modeled after the Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program, which helps farmers voluntarily take conservation measures such as reducing soil erosion and nutrient runoff. Ohio has banned farmers in the northwestern part of the state from spreading manure on frozen and rain-soaked fields and requires them to get training before using commercial fertilizers. Those regulations were adopted in response to algae outbreaks that contaminated drinking water in Toledo and southeastern Michigan last August.

 Mar 2, 2014 TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. – Sharp cutbacks in phosphorus runoff into Lake Erie are needed to counter a worsening problem of algae blooms that degrade water quality, harm fish and chase away tourists, a U.S.-Canadian agency said in a report to both governments Thursday. The International Joint Commission, which recommends policies dealing with the Great Lakes and other border waterways, recommended targets for lowering daily amounts of phosphorus flowing into the ailing Erie. It’s the smallest of the five lakes yet has the most abundant fish population and supports a billion-dollar angling and boating industry. The commission said the level must drop by 46 percent to shrink by half a “dead zone” where algae saps so much oxygen that fish can’t survive. It called for a 39 percent decrease on the western side of the lake where algae blooms have been particularly widespread. Phosphorus, a nutrient that feeds algae, was among pollutants that had so degraded Lake Erie by the 1970s that some declared it dead. The problem improved significantly with laws requiring steep reductions in phosphorus releases from wastewater treatment plants and factories. But it returned in the late 1990s and has steadily worsened. A bloom in summer of 2011 was the largest on record, coating a 1,930-square-mile surface area with greenish slime. The algae is poisonous enough to kill animals and make people sick. An Ohio township last year ordered residents not to drink tap water for two days because of algae pollution, while Toledo and other cities have tested and treated their supplies. When the algae dies, foul rotting mats wash onto beaches or sink to the bottom, robbing the water – and fish – of oxygen. The report largely blames the algae’s resurgence on manure and chemical fertilizer from farms, along with urban sources such as lawn fertilizers, pet droppings, leaky septic tanks and storm water drains. It proposes designating the lake as an impaired waterway under the federal Clean Water Act to force phosphorus limits. “It’s time for governments at all levels to put the lake on a diet by setting targets and achieving real reductions,” said Lana Pollack, chairwoman of the commission’s U.S. section. The reduction targets should be met by 2022, the report said. Overall levels have not risen since the mid-1990s, according to the report, based on two years of study by more than 60 scientists with universities, private firms and government agencies. But a type called dissolved reactive phosphorus, or DRP, has more than doubled – and it’s the variety “most easily used by the algae for growth,” said Don Scavia, director of the University of Michigan’s Graham Sustainability Institute. DRP chemical fertilizers are popular for producing corn used as animal feed on large industrial farms, Scavia said. Manure also can undergo a process that generates DRP. In the past couple of decades, farmers increasingly have applied both in fall and winter, when the material sometimes has remained atop frozen ground or snow instead of soaking in. Farmers also have done less tilling. ISHPEMING — All activities at the Ishpeming Multi-Purpose Senior Center have been suspended until April 6, ...

 Mar 13, 2013 Looking for an example of a bureaucracy trying to fix one problem and generating another? Try looking beneath the waves of western Lake Superior. A total of 22 barrels holding military ammunition, originally dumped into Lake Superior decades ago and recovered just last year, have now been re-dumped because a Wisconsin American Indian tribe lacked a federal waiver to bring them ashore. This is a prime case of good intentions leading to foolish actions. Last summer, the barrels were raised from the bottom of the lake, where they have sat since being dumped off barges in the late 1950s and early 1960s as part of a secret military project. The taxpayer-funded project was part of a $3.3 million Department of Defense program aimed at cleaning up military pollution on Indian lands. The barrels are located outside of Duluth Harbor, about 50 miles from the The Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Reservation, and the band has treaty authority to help manage natural resources on the lake. When they were raised, the barrels were found to contain thousands of tiny firecracker-sized explosive devices. Officials are worried about a chain reaction setting the barrels off. So getting these potentially harmful barrels off the bottom of Lake Superior must have been a good thing, right? No. Apparently the barrels were not allowed to be brought ashore at all because there are no federally approved facilities to receive explosives on the Great Lakes. So the tribe and the contractor who pulled the barrels up said they were left with no choice but to sink them again. The explosive devices were taken out of the original 55-gallon drums, put into new containers and dumped back into Superior, with the site marked by GPS. The tribe and the contractor hope to get federal waivers to retrieve the containers – again – soon. The whole exercise seems a colossal misuse of time and money. And the bureaucratic mess doesn’t end there. The tribe apparently transported three barrels, which it said fell below the threshhold of hazardous material, to a disposal facility in Sheboygan, Wis. That move sparked an investigation by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, trying to determine whether the barrels were moved without proper permits or notification. With an estimated 1,400 barrels of military waste still in rusting barrels at the bottom of the lake, we think regulatory agencies should focus on the cleanup rather than on forcing pollution back into the lake. A study of whether raising these barrels or allowing them to sink into the sediment would be better for the long term human and ecological health of the area is being undertaken. That report is due by September. We hope it offers a clear path forward for cleaning up this site. Beyond that, we urge all agencies – state, federal and tribal – to get on the same page.

 Jan 24, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Thursday ended federal protection for many of the nation’s millions of miles of streams, arroyos and wetlands, a sweeping environmental rollback that could leave the waterways more vulnerable to pollution from development, industry and farms. The policy change, signed by heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, narrows the types of waterways that qualify for federal protection under the half-century-old Clean Water Act. Since his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump has targeted environmental and public health regulations that he says imposed unnecessary burdens on business. Speaking to farmers in Texas on Sunday, Trump repeated his frequent charge that an Obama-era attempt in 2015 to more clearly define what water bodies qualify for federal pollution protection was “one of the most ridiculous regulations of all.”” Thursday’s changes to the clean water rule have long been sought by builders, oil and gas developers, farmers and others. But environmental groups and public-health advocates say the rollback will allow businesses to dump pollutants into newly federally unprotected waterways and fill in some wetlands, threatening public water supplies downstream and harming wildlife and habitat. EPA head Andrew Wheeler told reporters Thursday that states were still free to step in with state protections of newly vulnerable waterways if they chose. “Our rule protects the environment and our waterways while respecting the rights of states and property owners,” Wheeler said. The rollback of the clean-water enforcement “strikes the proper balance between Washington, D.C. and the states,” he said. Brett Hartl, a government affairs director with the Center for Biological Diversity conservation advocacy group, called the changes “a sickening gift to polluters.” The administration’s action “will allow wetlands, streams and rivers across a vast stretch of America to be obliterated with pollution,” Hartl said, contending the rollback would speed extinction for dozens of endangered species. “People and wildlife need clean water to thrive. Destroying half of our nation’s streams and wetlands will be one of Trump’s ugliest legacies.” The Trump rule narrows the Obama administration’s 2015 definition of what’s a protected body of water and effectively removes safeguards for some waterways that had been put into place with the 1972 Clean Water Act.The administration says the changes would allow farmers to plow their fields without fear of unintentionally straying over the banks of a federally protected dry creek, bog or ditch. But the government’s own figures show it is real estate developers and those in other nonfarm business sectors that take out the most permits for impinging on wetlands and waterways, and stand to reap the biggest regulatory and financial relief. Environmental groups said the draft version of the rule released earlier would have lifted federal protections for roughly half of the nation’s wetlands and one-fifth of the millions of miles of waterways. The administration challenges that estimate and says it is not possible to come up with a solid figure for how much of the nation’s surface water will be affected.One of the biggest changes applies to so-called ephemeral waters – creeks and rivers that run only after rainfalls or snow melt. Such streams provide a majority of the water for some dry Western states, including New Mexico. “That”s a huge rollback from way before Obama, before Reagan,” said Blan Holman, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. New Mexico officials have particular concerns given that the Rio Grande, which provides drinking water and irrigation supplies for millions of people in the Southwest and Mexico, depends largely on the types of intermittent streams, creeks and wetlands that could lose protection under the rule draft released earlier. The Rio Grande is one of North America’s longest rivers. In a statement, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham called the new rule “an absolute disaster for the state”s water resources. Another key change removes federal protections for wetlands deemed not directly connected to a major waterway. Geoff Gisler, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said it appears millions of acres of the wetlands on the Southeastern coast alone — vital buffers against flooding and climate change — would lose protections, as would so-called prairie pothole wetlands in the middle of the country, and others. The final rule will be published in the Federal Register in the next few days and become effective 60 days after that. Environmental groups and some states are promising legal challenges.

 Mar 16, 2019 WASHINGTON — African-Americans and Hispanics breathe in far more deadly air pollution than they are responsible for making, a new study said. A study looked at who is exposed to fine particle pollution — responsible for about 100,000 American deaths a year — and how much different races are responsible for the pollution based on their buying, driving and living habits. Scientists calculate that Hispanics on average breathe in 63 percent more of the pollution that leads to heart and breathing deaths than they make. For African-Americans the figure is 56 percent, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. On the other hand, non-Hispanic whites on average are exposed to 17 percent less air pollution than they make. “Even though minorities are contributing less to the overall problem of air pollution, they are affected by it more,” said study co-author Jason Hill, a biosystems engineering professor at the University of Minnesota who is white. “Is it fair (that) I create more pollution and somebody else is disproportionately affected by it?” This pollution comes from gases from smokestacks, tailpipes and other places that then solidify into fine invisible particles small enough to pass through lungs and into bloodstreams. These particles, more than 25 times smaller than the width of a human hair, pose the greatest risk to people’s health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says. While other studies have shown minorities living with more pollution, this study is one of the first to combine buying habits and exposure into one calculation of inequity, Hill said. Hill and colleagues looked at pollution from highways, coal-fired power plants, hog farms and other sources. They then looked in a large scale at who is driving more, buying more goods and food, spending more on property and using more electricity, then traced those purchases to end users. “On average whites tend to consume more than minorities. It’s because of wealth,” Hill said. “It’s largely how much you buy, not buying different things.” Of 103,000 particle pollution deaths a year, 83,000 can be traced to the activities of people in the United States — not government and not goods exported elsewhere, the study said Several outside experts praised the research. “These findings confirm what most grassroots environmental justice leaders have known for decades, ‘whites are dumping their pollution on poor people and people of color’,” said Texas Southern University public affairs professor Robert Bullard, who was not part of the research. Bullard, often called the father of environmental justice , is African-American. Bullard said his and other past research shows that African-Americans are 79 percent more likely than whites to live where industrial pollution is highest, with people of color overrepresented near Superfund sites and oil refineries. He said there are far more mostly minority schools within 500 feet of major highways than mostly white schools. “Being able to quantify the inequity is a key step toward addressing and reducing inequity,” said Christopher Frey, a professor of environmental engineering at North Carolina State University, who is white and not part of the research. One bright spot is that in recent decades the air has been getting cleaner in general, Hill said. However, his study stopped in 2015 and EPA data shows an uptick in fine particle pollution in 2017. But even with the cleaner air, it is still inequitable, Hill said. MINNEAPOLIS — President Donald Trump invoked emergency authority to marshal industry to fight the coronavirus, as ...

 Dec 6, 2018 WASHINGTON (AP) — After several years of little growth, global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide experienced their largest jump in seven years, discouraging scientists. World carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to have risen 2.7 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to three studies released Wednesday from the Global Carbon Project, an international scientific collaboration of academics, governments and industry that tracks greenhouse gas emissions. The calculations, announced during negotiations to put the 2015 Paris climate accord into effect, puts some of the landmark agreement’s goals nearly out of reach, scientists said. “This is terrible news,” said Andrew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive, which models greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures but was not part of the research. “Every year that we delay serious climate action, the Paris goals become more difficult to meet.” The studies concluded that this year the world would spew 40.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion tons last year. The margin of error is about one percentage point on either side. The Global Carbon Project uses government and industry reports to come up with final emission figures for 2017 and projections for 2018 based on the four biggest polluters: China, the United States, India and the European Union. The U.S., which had been steadily decreasing its carbon pollution, showed a significant rise in emissions — up 2.5 percent — for the first time since 2013. China, the globe’s biggest carbon emitter, saw its largest increase since 2011: 4.6 percent. Study lead author Corinne Le Quere, a climate change researcher at the University of East Anglia in England, said the increase is a surprising “reality check” after a few years of smaller emission increases. But she also doesn’t think the world will return to the even larger increases seen from 2003 to 2008. She believes unusual factors are at play this year. For the U.S., it was a combination of a hot summer and cold winter that required more electricity use for heating and cooling. For China, it was an economic stimulus that pushed coal-powered manufacturing, Le Quere said. John Reilly, co-director of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, said the results aren’t too surprising because fossil fuels still account for 81 percent of the world’s energy use. The burning of coal, oil and gas release carbon dioxide, which warms the Earth . Reilly, who wasn’t part of the study, praised it as impressive. Global Carbon Project chairman Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist, said he was discouraged. The Paris accord set two goals. The long-held goal would limit global warming to no more than 1.8 degrees from now, with a more ambitious goal of limiting warming to 0.9 degrees from now. The trend is such that the world would have to be lucky to keep warming to 1.8 degrees, let alone the lower goal, Le Quere said. China increased its emissions to 11.4 billion tons, while the U.S. jumped to a shade under 6 billion tons. The European Union spewed 3.9 billion tons and India soared to 2.9 billion tons. Overall, the world is spewing about 1,300 tons. Use of coal — the biggest carbon emitter — is rising. And while countries are using more renewable fuels and trying to reduce carbon from electricity production, emissions from cars and planes are steadily increasing, Le Quere said. Global carbon dioxide emissions have increased 55 percent in the last 20 years, the calculations show. At the same time, Earth has warmed on average about two-thirds of a degree, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

 May 17, 2018 BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Environmental groups challenged the Trump administration in federal court Wednesday over its rejection of an Obama-era proposal that would have required mining companies to prove they have enough money to clean up their pollution. The Idaho Conservation League, Earthworks, Sierra Club and other groups filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. asking it to review last year’s move to drop the rule. An attorney for the environmental groups said the reversal under Trump leaves taxpayers responsible into the future for mining pollution that fouls waterways and endangers public health. The proposal applied to “hard-rock” mines that extract gold, iron, lead and other minerals, but not coal. Mining industry representatives and members of Congress from Western states pushed to kill the rule, arguing it was unnecessary and duplicated cleanup requirements already enforced at the state and federal level. In December, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt agreed with the industry’s contention that modern mining techniques decrease pollution risks. During the tenure of former President Barack Obama, the EPA determined the opposite — that mining pollution remains an ongoing concern and companies should be required to provide “financial assurances” such as surety bonds for possible cleanup projects. There is a long legacy of taxpayer-funded mine cleanups at many sites where companies went bankrupt and abandoned polluted sites. Trump’s EPA “just waved their hands at all their prior findings and offered some really flimsy rationale for why they shouldn’t be considered,” said Earthjustice attorney Amanda Goodin, who represents the environmental groups. “It’s a thinly veiled handout to the mining industry.” Hard-rock mining companies would have faced a combined $7.1 billion financial obligation under the Obama era rule, costing them up to $171 million annually to set aside sufficient funds to pay for future cleanups, according to an EPA analysis. Since 1980, at least 52 mines and mine processing sites had spills or other releases of pollution, according to documents previously released by the EPA. The industry’s troubles were highlighted in 2015, when an EPA cleanup team accidentally triggered a 3-million gallon (11-million liter) spill of contaminated water from Colorado’s inactive Gold King mine, tainting rivers in three states with heavy metals including arsenic and lead. The financial assurance rule was proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency in January 2017 after environmental groups pressed the government to enforce a long-ignored provision in the 1980 federal Superfund law. Coal mines are required to provide assurances that they will pay for pollution cleanups under a 1977 federal law.

 Mar 3, 2018 BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Major utilities have found evidence of groundwater contamination at coal-burning power plants across the U.S. where landfills and man-made ponds have been used for decades as dumping grounds for coal ash, according to data released by plant owners under a Friday deadline. Heightened levels of pollutants– including arsenic and radium in some cases — were documented at plants in numerous states, from Virginia and North Carolina to Washington and Alaska. The Environmental Protection Agency required the plant owners to install test wells to monitor groundwater pollution as a first step toward cleaning up the sites. The future of that effort was cast into uncertainty Thursday when the Trump administration announced it intends to roll back aspects of the program to reduce the industry’s compliance costs by up to $100 million annually. “There’s no dispute that the underlying groundwater is being contaminated. We see that clearly,” said Duke University professor Avner Vengosh, who researches the effects of coal ash and has reviewed some of the new data. “The real question is whether it’s migrating toward people or wells next to (coal plants).” Vengosh added that the discovery at some sites of radium at levels far exceeding drinking water standards — which can increase the risk of cancer — were of particular concern. It appears to mark the first time coal ash has been associated with radioactivity in groundwater, he said. Duke Energy spokeswoman Erin Culbert noted that government-sponsored research has shown most coal ash does not have radioactive elements, and the issue does not represent a health concern for neighbors of its plants. The Associated Press conducted an initial review of the reports, which were still being filed Friday, and spoke with power company executives across the country, who warned against misinterpreting the pollution data. Generally, they said further studies were needed to confirm the ash storage sites as the source of the contamination and whether public drinking water supplies were threatened. U.S. coal plants produce about 100 million tons annually of ash and other waste, much of which ends up in old, unlined disposal ponds that are prone to leaking. Some have been in use for decades. Among large U.S. utilities, Duke Energy reported preliminary findings of contamination of groundwater at 48 ash basins and landfills. American Electric Power, or AEP, reported potential groundwater impacts at 24 ash disposal sites. Dominion Energy, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Xcel Energy and others also reported evidence of contamination. Mark McCullough, executive vice president at AEP, said the company needed more data to decide which sites will need to close. “These (monitoring) wells that are close to the sites are telling us something, and we are committed to doing the hard work and to understand where the real source is and what it is,” McCullough said. Pam Faggert, the chief environmental officer for Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion, said the company also conducts surface water tests near its facilities and was confident that the groundwater impacts were not having an effect on public drinking water or public safety offsite. Coal ash storage and disposal went largely unregulated until a 2008 spill at a Tennessee Valley Authority power plant in Kingston, Tennessee. A containment dike burst and flooding covered more than 300 acres , dumped waste into two nearby rivers, destroyed homes and brought national attention to the issue. In 2014, an estimated 39,000 tons of coal ash spewed into the Dan River after a drainage pipe running below a waste dump collapsed at a Duke Energy plant in Eden, North Carolina. The toxic sludge turned the river gray for more than 70 miles). Apart from spills, other ash problems have been documented across the country. In Montana, an estimated 200 million gallons (757 million liters) of contaminated water a year are leaking into the groundwater from ash ponds in the city of Colstrip, leaving the water undrinkable. In North Carolina, some neighbors of Duke power plants have been relying on bottled water since toxic chemicals appeared in some of their wells. In Virginia, Dominion has offered to hook some neighbors of the Possum Point Power Station up to municipal water or filtration systems after groundwater testing found elevated levels of some contaminants. Remediation work at some coal ash disposal areas already is underway. AEP has closed six ash storage sites to date, the company said. Duke Energy has started excavation work at 11 sites and had spent $1.4 billion on such efforts through last December, the company disclosed last week. It plans to spend another $2.5 billion on ash site closures over the next five years. Attorney Frank Holleman with the Southern Environmental Law Center said the disclosure of the utilities’ data was critical to informing the public about how much arsenic, mercury and other pollutants are leaking into groundwater supplies. He pushed back against the utilities’ argument that the data so far has been largely indicative of on-site contamination, not a broader public health threat, saying groundwater doesn’t stay in one place — it moves and flows. “The groundwater resources of these communities are not something that the utilities have a right to trash and throw away,” he said. “They don’t own the groundwater. That’s a public resource.” MINNEAPOLIS — President Donald Trump invoked emergency authority to marshal industry to fight the coronavirus, as ...

 Nov 18, 2017 WASHINGTON (AP) — Global carbon pollution rose this year after three straight years when levels of the heat-trapping gas didn’t go up at all, scientists reported Monday. Preliminary figures project that worldwide carbon dioxide emissions are up about 2 percent this year, according to an international team of scientists. Most of the increase came from China. The report by the Global Carbon Project team dashed hopes that emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas had peaked. “We hoped that we had turned the corner… We haven’t,” said study co-author Rob Jackson, an Earth scientist at Stanford University. Carbon dioxide emissions rose steadily and slowly starting in the late 1880s with the Industrial Revolution, then took off dramatically in the 1950s. In the last three years, levels had stabilized at about 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide (36.2 billion metric tons). Estimates for 2017 put it at about 40.8 billion tons (37 billion metric tons). Sixty years ago , the world spewed only 9.2 billion tons (8.3 billion metric tons). “It’s a bit staggering,” said co-author Ralph Keeling, a Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientist, noting in an email that levels have increased fourfold since he was born in the 1950s. “We race headlong into the unknown.” Man-made carbon dioxide is causing more than 90 percent of global warming since 1950, U.S. scientists reported this month. This year’s increase was mostly spurred by a 3.5 percent jump in Chinese carbon pollution, said study co-author Glen Peters, a Norwegian scientist. Declines in the United States (0.4 percent) and Europe (0.2 percent) were smaller than previous years. India, the No. 3 carbon polluting nation, went up 2 percent. The 2017 estimate comes to on average of 2.57 million pounds (1.16 million kilograms) of carbon dioxide spewing into the air every second. The study was published Monday and is being presented in Bonn, Germany, during climate talks where leaders are trying to come up with rules for the 2015 Paris deal. The goal is to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times, but it’s already warmed half that amount. “It was tough enough and if this paper is indicative of long-term trends, it just got tougher,” said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who wasn’t part of the team of 76 scientists who wrote the report. While he called the study authoritative, Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said he sees no need to do figures for 2017 that are not complete, saying it may be “jumping the gun a bit.” Jackson said the team — which produces these reports every year in November — has confidence in its 2017 report because it is based on real data from top polluting nations through the summer and in some cases through October. Plus, he said past estimates have been correct within a couple tenths of a percentage point. The top five carbon polluting countries are China, the United States, India, Russia and Japan. Europe taken as a whole, would rank third. MINNEAPOLIS — President Donald Trump invoked emergency authority to marshal industry to fight the coronavirus, as ...
