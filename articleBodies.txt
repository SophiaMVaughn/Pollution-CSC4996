 The Midland Daily News This column will be a little different than the usual approach that I take. I read an interesting commentary about an interview taken from Medcape Family Medicine, July 14, 2016, with Robert D. Brook, MD, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Michigan and Director of the Hypertension Center there. Dr. Brook is from Michigan and does research on the effects of air pollution. He said he was sitting on the beach in the late 1990s with his brother who is an atmospheric scientist. Dr. Brook thought the haze he saw on the horizon, while looking over Lake Michigan, was “sea haze.” His brother explained to him, however, that it was pollution causing the foggy atmosphere. It piqued Dr. Brook’s interest and so began his lifelong research into the effects of pollution on healthcare. As with most of us, Dr. Brook thought the major problem with air pollution was that it caused lung problems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other issues like these. Research has shown, however, that the majority of health effects from air pollution are adverse cardiovascular events. This includes heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and sudden death. Air pollution is the ninth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Air pollution in defined in terms of fine PM. A PM 2.5 means particles that are less than 2.5 µm in diameter. They result from fossil fuel combustion (coal, gas, etc.), mobile sources such as traffic, or the energy industry in the modern world. The PM for a particular size is then measured in weight/m3. In the United States, the average PM 2.5 is about 10 µg/m3. In comparison, PM levels in a smoky bar are about 500 µg/m3. A little bit confusing but just compare the numbers while reading below. For the last few years, the United States has gone down from levels of 25 to 30 µg/m3 in the 1970s and 1980s to an average level of 10 µg/m3 now. This dramatic reduction has translated into an improvement in all-cause mortality leading to a six- to seven-month increase in life expectancy on average in the United States. (I thought that was pretty impressive!) However, close to 25 percent of Americans are still exposed to levels above the World Health Organization standards of 10µg/m3. Many such areas are next to roadways or in urban industrial locations. People in Asia, particularly China and India, are exposed to far higher levels of pollution than we now are. These are also the areas where cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are escalating dramatically. It is interesting to note that second-hand smoke levels are around 500 µg/m3. One cigarette delivers well over 5000 to 10,000 µg/m3. One cigarette is comparable to a month’s worth of exposure to air pollution in Beijing, China! So how does air pollution trigger the cardiovascular/heart problems? Extensive research has shown different ways. Pollutants injure the lining of the blood vessels, they cause the blood vessels to constrict and narrow, and the platelets in the blood which are involved in clotting become more sensitized and clot more easily. This all leads to more clots in the vessels (strokes and heart attacks) and arrhythmias in the heart (sudden death). (I’m simplifying this significantly!) Then the next question is: How do the pollutants do these things? For those of you who have read this column regularly, you have learned that it appears that inflammation is the first step in the cascade of events that cause strokes, heart attacks, cancer and dementia. Reduce inflammation and you reduce all of these major killers. It turns out that when the lung inhales pollution particles, the lung tissue becomes inflamed. The inflammation isn’t just isolated to the lungs, but rather inflammatory chemicals throughout the body are increased. Subsequently, the inflammation causes vascular and cardiovascular tissue to be inflamed, causing constricting of the vessels, as well as the clotting and buildup of atheroscleratic plaques. Interesting! Inflammation is the culprit once again. Many of us have heard about inflammation around the gums (gingivitis) causing heart disease. It’s part of the same story. Gingivitis causes significant inflammation which generalizes throughout the body. It is the chemicals that cause inflammation that lead to the major problems of strokes, heart attacks, cancer, and dementia. A second way that air pollution leads to heart problems is that the lung can sense these foreign particles and promote rapid changes in the body’s chemistry. It’s sort of the “flight or fight” response. Our body surges with various hormonal chemicals when it feels “attacked” and that leads to an increase in blood pressure, constriction of blood vessels, and heart arrhythmias. The final way that the pollution affects the heart and blood vessels is that the very chemicals causing the pollution are toxic in themselves. Those chemicals are absorbed through the lungs and have a direct effect on various body tissues. There are thousands of very fine particles of organic chemicals and metals in pollution. Cigarette smoke is a convenient way to deliver nicotine into the body, but the air we breathe delivers many of those other chemicals also. If scientists can detect these bodily responses to short term exposures to pollutants, imagine what happens over the long term. Think of the adverse effects on the body’s systems. We must remember that pollution is not the only factor causing heart and lung problems. Diet, obesity and exercise all play a role. But when you add on pollution, the effects multiply. One final thing in the interview was discussion of the mask that you see many Asians wearing when they are in the major cities. Do they filter out pollution? Mostly the masks being worn are simple surgical masks that protect people from respiratory droplets. They aren’t made to protect us from the fine particles in air. China and the rest of Asia are often exposed to PM levels between 100 to 500 µg/m3 (10 to 50 times what the average level is in the United States). There is some evidence showing that home air filters or purifications systems with HEPA filters do reduce exposures and lead to improved health. Research is ongoing. So, as I noted, this is a little different approach to my usual column, but rather interesting stuff, isn’t it? Dr. John L. Pfenninger’s column appears on Sundays. His office, Medical Procedures Center, is located in Midland.

 By EMERY P. DALESIO RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina judge said Friday he wants to review a surprise deal settling decades of groundwater pollution at Duke Energy's coal ash pits because he questioned the motives behind the company's deal with state environmental regulators. The deal reduced the $25 million fine at a Wilmington power plant that state regulators had promoted as the largest penalty for environmental damage in state history. The agreement cut the fine to $7 million but also sought to resolve groundwater pollution claims at all 14 of the company's power plants storing toxic coal ash, not just one. The judge who signed off on the settlement last fall went too far with his order that seemed to close lawsuits involving conservation groups, Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway said. "It is a bit surprising that in a penalty case over one plant, it developed into as comprehensive a settlement as this," Ridgeway said. The Department of Environmental Quality could decide the appropriate fine for Duke Energy polluting the groundwater at its Sutton power plant, Ridgeway said. But because Administrative Law Judge Phil Berger Jr. wasn't asked to rewrite the scope of his order approving the deal, Ridgeway said he suspected the settlement's language was designed to close the courtroom door to environmental groups or others. "I have to suspect that there is some ulterior motive," he said. The parties later agreed to ask Berger to revise his order, Duke Energy spokeswoman Erin Culbert said. Berger is the son of state Senate leader Phil Berger. The Republican's district includes Eden, site of a 2014 spill of toxic coal ash that prompted a new law requiring Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash holding pits by 2029. State water quality officials knew for years about the contamination at Sutton's unlined ash pits but took no enforcement action until August 2013 — after a citizens groups tried to sue Duke Energy. Monitoring wells near Duke's dumps at Sutton showed readings exceeding state groundwater standards for chemicals including boron and thallium, which was used in rat poison until it was banned because it is highly toxic. The hearing came on the day DEQ signed off for the first time on plans to drain the water off the top of basins where coal ash is collected, a needed step to closing, excavating or covering them. The state permit for work at Duke Energy's Riverbend power plant in Mount Holly is intended to be a model for documents needed to close coal ash pits around the state. It allows water to be diverted to rivers and streams until 3 feet of water remains above the ash. Duke Energy will be required to test fish near the discharge site to see whether their bodies contain collected mercury or lead, and twice a year test the waterway for those heavy metals and arsenic, chromium and cadmium. ___ Follow Emery P.

 The Associated Press FREEPORT, Texas (AP) — Before Houston and its suburbs were built, a dense forest naturally purified the air along a stretch of the Texas Gulf Coast that grew thick with pecan, ash, live oak and hackberry trees. It was the kind of pristine woodland that was mostly wiped out by settlers in their rush to clear land and build communities. Now one of the nation’s largest chemical companies and one of its oldest conservation groups have forged an unlikely partnership that seeks to recreate some of that forest to curb pollution. The plan drafted by The Dow Chemical Co. and the Nature Conservancy is only in its infancy and faces many hurdles. But it envisions a day when expensive machines used to capture industrial pollutants might be at least partially replaced by restoring some of the groves of native trees that once filled the land. “It looks very promising at the early stage of the research,” said Mark Weick, director of sustainability programs for Dow. “But for this to become something that is an emission control, everyone needs to know it works.” Many plants, and especially trees, capture pollution naturally when it hits their leaves. Trees with the biggest leaves and the widest canopies capture the most pollutants, especially nitrogen oxide, a common byproduct of combustion that can irritate lungs and contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone. The reforestation proposal imagines emissions from Dow’s largest North American factory drifting downwind into the trees near Freeport, Texas. Dow and the Nature Conservancy began a six-year, $10 million collaboration in 2011, when they came together to look at ways natural resources could be used to save the company money. After reading an obscure notation by the federal Environmental Protection Agency that suggested reforestation could improve air quality, the two groups decided to research how the idea might work and whether it could be cost-effective. Scientists used a complex model from the U.S. Forest Service that considers everything from wind patterns to the size of tree leaves and the overall canopy to estimate the air-quality improvements that might come from 1,000 acres of forest. “The big discovery was that you could combine the traditional infrastructure with reforestation and still meet regulation,” said Laura Huffman, the conservancy’s director in Texas. The trees, Huffman said, may not completely replace traditional technology, but they could complement it, allowing factories to use smaller, cheaper equipment. The research found that over 30 years a 1,000-acre forest would remove 4 to 7 tons of nitrogen oxide annually, said Timm Kroeger, a senior environmental economist with the conservancy. A traditional mechanical “scrubber” removes about 50 to 70 tons annually. So a 10,000-acre forest equals one average industrial scrubber, he explained. And in this part of Texas, where open land is ample, reforestation is within reach. The cost of the project not including the land would be about the same as using traditional forms of pollution control, Weick said. Organizers hope to work with a landowner interested in reforesting, probably with help from conservation tax credits. Or the Nature Conservancy or the federal government would buy the land and give it to Dow free of charge. A recent progress report determined that the cost of cleaning a ton of nitrogen oxide through reforestation was $2,400 to $4,000, compared with $2,500 to $5,000 using traditional equipment. The research is still being reviewed by other scientists. And before any formal plan could be adopted, it would have to win approval from state and federal regulators, who would require any pollution-cleansing method to be quantifiable and enforceable. Trees may not fit the bill. Unlike machines, they are living organisms that are subject to diseases, droughts and other threats such as hurricanes or fires. Back in 2005, another scientific group researched a similar idea and decided it would not pay off. “The conclusion that we reached was that what they were trying to do was difficult and that the degree of uncertainty was larger than the benefits,” said Mark Estes, a senior air quality scientist with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Even if it wins broad support, the plan won’t be approved anytime soon. In Texas, it can take up to four years to change clean-air rules. And that’s before any proposal moves up to the EPA. As he looked out over land ripe for reforestation, Jeff Wiegel, the conservancy’s director of strategic initiatives in Texas, was realistic about the pace of progress. “It’s a long road toward that,” he said.

 The Dow Chemical Co. will pay to clean up six areas of contaminated sediment in the Tittabawassee River as part of a new agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The pollution is in the three-mile stretch of the river that is adjacent to Dow’s Michigan Operations site. It is the first segment in what the EPA expects to be a series of upstream-to-downstream cleanup projects. Unlike high levels of dioxin found in other areas of the river, this segment contains arsenic, chlorobenzenes, chlorophenols and more that were released by Dow. In three of the six areas, cleanup also will take place for dense non-aqueous phase liquid, or DNAPL, which the EPA said is a heavy liquid made up of materials that do not mix with water and sink to the bottom of the river. The planned work and previously released cost estimates are as follows: • Area 1: Place a clean cap over contaminated sediment to isolate and stabilize the sediment. Cost: $250,000. • Areas 2 and 3: Remove and treat DNAPL, isolate contaminated sediment with sheet pile and a cap and capture water within the sediment and treat it. Cost: $1.8 million. • Areas 4 and 5: Place a clean cap over contaminated sediment to prevent erosion. Cost: $600,000. • Area 6: Dredge and dispose of sediment contaminated by ethyl parathion; remove and treat DNAPL; isolate remaining contaminated sediment with sheet pile and a cap; and capture water within the sediment and treat it. Cost: $3.1 million. “Materials will be treated and disposed at approved locations, sites will be monitored during and after the cleanup and the cleanup systems will operate and be maintained,” the EPA stated in an e-mail announcing the new agreement. Mary Logan, EPA remedial project manager, previously said the cleanup would prevent chemicals on the surface from harming small invertebrates or contaminating areas downstream if the sediment was disturbed. Dow spokeswoman Mary Draves said the company remains focused on moving toward a resolution. “Now that the plan for segment 1 has been finalized we will begin to conduct work as outlined in the agreement,” Draves said in an e-mail. “This, along with other work we have conducted, is part of our continued work with both the EPA and MDEQ towards progress on implementation of our agreement.” Visit www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/dowchemical for more information about the Superfund site.

 Tony Lascariof the Daily News Replacing contaminated soil, cleaning homes and paving roads in Saginaw's Riverside Boulevard neighborhood are all meant to prevent residents from being exposed to dioxins and furans. But, it's possible the work will need to be repeated in the future because the Tittabawassee River regularly floods the area containing 11 homes. The Dow Chemical Co. and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed to cleanup work in July, and officials involved recognize there are limitations. "It's going to reflood; it's going to recontaminate to some extent," said Al Taylor, a Michigan Department of Environmental Quality geologist. It is unclear how fast, and at what level, contamination will return, Taylor said. He said previous cleanup sites have varied from having little to "significant" recontamination following flooding. A monitoring system needs to be developed to make sure contamination levels do not rise to current levels, Taylor said. He said action would have to be taken if levels rise to where they become a problem again. With work taking place to remove contamination upriver of the neighborhood, officials hope recontamination can be prevented. Dow's 1,900-acre chemical manufacturing plant in Midland was a source of dioxins and furans, which are byproducts from the manufacture of chlorine-based products. Dow spokesman John Musser has said the contamination found in the Saginaw neighborhood is thought to have been the result of releases from pre-World War I operations. Jeff Kimble, on scene coordinator with EPA Region 5, said the houses are unique because they regularly flood, as opposed to other houses along the river that generally are built above the floodplain. Detailed sampling of the neighborhood was triggered by one initial sample that contained 5,900 parts per trillion of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds. The testing found more than 10,000 parts per trillion in surface soils in the neighborhood. Kimble said samples taken indoors indicate the contaminants are being tracked indoors. In the yards, two feet of soil will be removed from the riverbank to Riverside Boulevard and replaced with fresh soil and vegetation. The dirt road, which creates dust in dry periods, will be paved. "Dow has been steadfastly working out there," Kimble said, with a goal of finishing by Oct. 15. Four other areas of concern that have a higher priority for the EPA also are being examined to determine contamination levels in residential soil. Kimble said those properties do not have houses as close to the floodplain, like the Riverside Drive neighborhood does.

 JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer France, stung by oil tanker disasters that soiled its seas and beaches, is moving to protect one its most precious maritime resources _ the Mediterranean _ with stiff new punishments for polluters. The measures, adopted last week by the French parliament in a rare show of unanimity, will create an environmental protection zone off southern France's Mediterranean coast, whose sun-drenched waters and beaches draw hordes of tourists every year. World Wildlife Fund oceanographer Denis Ody welcomed the effort but said France must strengthen policing in the Mediterranean to make it effective. "This law is a good idea but will work only if accompanied by the financial and human means to have it taken seriously," he said Monday from the southern port city of Marseille. The measures, which President Jacques Chirac is expected to sign soon, are directed at shippers deliberately dumping oil, garbage and other pollutants in the Mediterranean. It seeks to punish them even when they are outside French territorial waters. Under the law, France will create an ecological protection zone extending up to 90 miles from its Mediterranean coast. France says it does not need the approval of neighboring countries to implement the new measures, though other Mediterranean nations it has contacted generally welcomed the idea. The Mediterranean is a major world shipping route linking the Atlantic Ocean with the Suez Canal. About a quarter of global oil traffic goes through the Mediterranean, according to French government figures. In 1999, the sinking of a 25-year-old tanker called the Erika spilled 3 million gallons of oil that washed up on France's Atlantic beaches. Another oil spill last year off northwestern Spain added urgency to French and European efforts to tighten maritime safety laws. The Prestige disgorged millions of gallons of oil when it broke up and sank in November, polluting Spanish and French coasts and shutting down fisheries. But French authorities say the washing out of ballast, oil and fuel tanks, the dumping of garbage at sea and similar practices cause more pollution than shipping accidents. "It's this deliberate pollution that is the main target" of the new measures, said Tokia Saifi, France's secretary of state for sustainable development, when she presented the proposals to lawmakers Thursday. Ships flush their tanks at sea because it is cheaper and quicker than doing so in port, and because few ports have tank-washing facilities, Ody said. Studies suggest 225 million gallons of oil and fuel are flushed into the Mediterranean each year this way, he said. "It's a chronic problem," Ody said. Captains of ships caught washing out oil tanks in the zone risk fines of up to $600,000. Their vessels could be seized until the fine is paid, French government officials said. Captains of French ships caught polluting the zone also risk up to four years in prison. The government expects the law to take effect before the summer, when sun-loving tourists descend on Mediterranean beaches en masse.

 DAVE BRYAN Associated Press Writer David Baker remembers the upheaval in his hometown of Anniston in the 1990s when many residents realized their health and property had been contaminated by toxic PCBs from a nearby chemical plant. The experience spurred Baker and others in predominantly poor, black west Anniston to form Community Against Pollution to fight for damages and clean up the contamination. Today, most of the group's members have been involved in lawsuits against the chemical company. "It was just something you could not believe in these days and times to see the people who suffered behind this," Baker recalled. Like Baker, citizens in many poor, black communities around Alabama and the South in recent years have fought companies who have located pollution-spewing industrial plants, hazardous landfills and waste incinerators near homes and schools. Known as "environmental racism," the practice of locating such toxic operations near politically powerless blacks has been stymied by the emerging citizen groups. "Companies now don't just bully in," said Robert Bullard, sociology professor at Clark Atlanta University. "When they do, they're in for a rude awakening. There is no path of least resistance any more." Bullard, author of "Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class and Environmental Quality," said many members of watchdog groups are involved in lawsuits seeking massive damage judgments. Over time, as low-income neighborhoods in Southern towns became more racially mixed, poor people, white and black, joined in the fight, Bullard said. They often run up against business and civic leaders working to develop communities economically. To the developers, such projects often bring in badly needed jobs and revenues for areas that sometimes have little of either. Larry Lee, a spokesman for a company that reopened a landfill in east Alabama last year, said many supported the project, which brought about 35 jobs to a rural community in Tallapoosa County. But in 2000, a company that planned to build Alabama's biggest solid waste landfill withdrew its proposal after the Rev. Jesse Jackson joined residents to oppose the dump in predominantly black and poor Macon County. The landfill would have covered 700 to 800 acres near the town of Shorter and accepted up to 5,000 tons of trash a day from around the South. But Milton McGregor, a white who is a dog track magnate and property owner, withdrew the application after meeting with Jackson and other leaders, and a day before the county commission was to vote on it. Bullard said environmental racism has its roots in the segregationist era in the South when racially segregated schools were legal and building paved roads or parks in black communities was optional. As the New South began to take shape following World War II, politicians in many Southern towns wanted to create jobs and bring in tax revenues to grow local economies. "In many cases (the South) would accept things that other regions would say no to," Bullard said. "Race was a major player in determining where these facilities went in and how they were operated." Many companies moved projects such as waste incinerators and petrochemical plants out of the crowded Northeast. Typical was Sumter County in Alabama, where the nation's largest hazardous waste landfill was built at Emelle in 1978. The 3,200-acre waste treatment, storage and disposal facility came to the predominantly black county during a period when few blacks held public office there. The disposal site, run by Waste Management Inc., created jobs in the area, but it received some of the most hazardous wastes from Superfund sites in the United States and from foreign countries. It handled nearly 800,000 tons of hazardous waste at its peak in 1989 until state officials began to see its negative impact. The state imposed higher taxes on waste shipments and fewer PCB-contaminated materials were sent as tonnage dropped. In the early 1990s an awareness of environmental racism arose among community activists and academics, said Bullard. He said Louisiana in particular became a "hotbed" of environmental racism lawsuits, with many communities along the Mississippi River serving as sites for incinerators and petrochemical plants. In the mid-1990s, the Japanese company, Shintech Inc., wanted to build a $700 million plastics plant in St. James Parish. But parish residents got help from student attorneys at Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. Shintech eventually scaled down the plan to $250 million, and moved it to Plaquemine. In rural Lowndes County, one of the poorest in the country, efforts to build a 230-acre solid waste landfill near the historic Selma-to-Montgomery National Historic Trail are on hold because of community outrage. County commissioners approved the project on land owned by Waste Management Inc. But Lowndes County Citizens United for Action sued to halt construction, contending in part it was wrong to put a waste disposal site near the highways where marchers helped inspire the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The case is making its way through the courts. The mainly black county residents had support from the mainly white residents of Lowndesboro. "Twelve jobs _ come on," said Barbara Evans, who heads the community group. "Twelve jobs for a dump on the … historic civil rights trial." Evans said with roughly 250 types of landfills in the state, including 29 that take in more than 32,000 tons of waste daily, Alabama doesn't need new landfills to handle its trash. "I think Alabama is being targeted and I think especially the communities of color and low-income neighborhoods are being targeted," she said.

 Ralph E. Wirtz of the Daily News If you are a little younger, you still would have seen some of the tanks and the smokestacks, but the wording on the side would have changed. You would have seen "Total" emblazoned across the white metal. Today, you can still see some of the tanks and some of the smokestacks, even though the plant closed two years ago. But they are going fast, as are the remnants of what used to be a thriving industry in this Gratiot County city. Including, the residents hope, the pollution. The pollution is what you wouldn't have seen had you been driving through Alma - the oil slowly seeping toward the groundwater through the earth, or the sludge that accumulated on the bottom of Horse Creek, a tributary of the Pine River used for outflow from the Total refinery waste ponds. Some people noticed, although few outside Chicago, Lansing or the immediate area. For the past eight years, investigations have revealed large amounts of pollution in the ground, water and air surrounding the plant site. The investigations have resulted in a $4 million fine and a $9 million cleanup project for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock - the latest owner of the property. The stories of the cleanups along the river between Alma and St. Louis are intertwined, much like the histories of the two cities. They both grew in fits and starts, counting logging and agriculture as the first wave of industry, heavy manufacturing in the early 1900s as the second and growth of two distinct industries as the third. The chemical industry in St. Louis began in 1935, when the Michigan Chemical Co. began taking brine from the ground near the area's mineral springs, turning it into bromides and salt. Crystal Flow salt was a hot item in area grocery stores. As Michigan Chemical grew, it began producing methyl, ethyl bromides, magnesia, DDT, antihistamines and analgesics, and the waste from these processes went right into the river. People then didn't know what they do now about controlling pollution and there were few laws and regulations to force them to comply. In the middle of the century, if a reactor overflowed, it was allowed to just spill onto the ground, according to Jack Bails, who was chief of the Environmental Law Enforcement Division of the Department of Natural Resources beginning in 1976. "If people had a liquid they wanted to get rid of, they would just take it to the back 40," he said. "It was common practice at a lot of chemical manufacturing facilities." Ron Orwig, who now lives in Mount Pleasant, worked 13 years for Michigan Chemical. He agrees, citing one incident from 1974 or 1975. "I remember a hydrochloric acid tank, I don't know how many thousands of gallons were in it, that was being pumped, and whoever was pumping it forgot to open up the valve, and they sucked the bottom out of the tank. All that acid went right into the river." Even when the companies were abiding by the rules, the weak environmental laws of that time allowed problems to brew. "In the late 1970s, it became pretty obvious that disposal practices at chemical manufacturers were a major problem," Bails said. Sean Horne, project manager for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. is in charge of tearing down the last of the refineries which dominated the Alma landscape since Mid-West Refinery opened its doors in 1934. Shortly thereafter, three other refineries - Leonard, Wolverine and Northern - opened after the Durbin Gusher was discovered in the Mount Pleasant oilfields in 1935. Another - the McClanahan Refinery -opened in St. Louis but was bought by Leonard in 1938 and moved into Leonard's operation. Wolverine and Northern closed shortly thereafter. Alma's two remaining refineries kept employment steady until Mid-West was purchased by Leonard in 1966 and closed. In the early 1970s, Leonard was purchased by the French oil company Total and operated until 1999, when it closed. Sixty years of putting pollutants into area waterways overwhelmed the system, and now community members and officials are taking the steps to clean it. In St. Louis, the Environmental Protection Agency has named the river a Superfund site and is taking out sediments that read as high as 34,000 parts per million DDT, along with high levels of polybrominated biphenyls and hexabromobenzene. In addition, Scott Cornelius of the Environmental Response Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is seeking to correct a problem at the Michigan Chemical plant site that threatens the cleanup. In Alma, the EPA came to an agreement with UDS to put $9 million toward the cleanup of petroleum pollutants from Horse Creek and the Pine River. Jim Sygo, chief of the Waste Management Division of MDEQ, said more will be spent, if needed, to bring the waterway and other contaminated areas "to the satisfaction of the state and state guidelines." State officials thought they had the problem solved in St. Louis in 1982, when the state, the Environmental Protection Agency and Velsicol Chemical Co., which purchased Michigan Chemical Co. in the 1970s, signed an agreement to cap the 54-acre plant site and contain any pollutants there. In the agreement, no action was taken on the pollutants in the river, and officials today say they believed at the time that sediments would cover the pollution, keeping it out of the food chain. "At that time, that's what we thought," Bails said. Unfortunately, they were wrong.

 LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer Environmental groups criticized Israel on Tuesday for a plan to dump treated factory wastewater into the Mediterranean Sea. For decades, factories have been discharging untreated waste into the Kishon River, which empties into the Mediterranean at Haifa Bay north of Tel Aviv. But the Environment Ministry banned the practice beginning Tuesday. As part of a master plan to clean up the polluted river, a bypass pipe would be built to carry factory wastewater with certain types of salts directly to the sea. Environmental groups said the ministry had failed to research possible harm to plant and animal life in the sea. "There are organic wastes, poisons and metals in that water," said Sharon Shemesh-Rosenbaum, a spokeswoman for the Israeli branch of Greenpeace. "We don't trust the factories to let only salts flow through the pipe into the sea." The ministry said it is studying the environmental affect to determine the length of the bypass and a best location to minimize harm to the sea. Officials believe "releasing the effluent into the depths of the sea will not damage the quality of the sea water," a ministry statement said. About 700,000 cubic feet of untreated water were being dumped daily into the Kishon River. As of Tuesday, all wastewater must be treated before it is discharged. The push to clean up the Kishon began in 2000 when it was revealed that 40 out of 750 divers of an elite navy unit, who had carried out diving exercises in the river, contracted cancer. The Kishon River and Haifa Bay are lined with chemical factories, which have been dumping their waste into the waterway for decades. Greenpeace also criticized Israel for allowing the heavy pollution of the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv, which also flows into the Mediterranean Sea. ___ On the Net: Ministry of Environment: http://www.sviva.gov.il// Greenpeace Mediterranean: http://www.greenpeacemed.org.mt/

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer Praising the advantages of an environmental law it has criticized, the Bush administration announced agreements Wednesday with Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Alcoa Inc. to reduce air pollution in 16 states. The settlements under the "new source review" provisions of the Clean Air Act will result in nearly $680 million in spending to reduce about 130,000 tons of air pollution a year, Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department officials said. "I'm willing to admit that this has been a very good tool," EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said of those provisions, which her agency changed last year. "But it's not the best we can do." Whitman and Assistant Attorney General Tom Sansonetti emphasized they will strongly pursue cases such as these even as the administration seeks further changes in the law. ADM , of Decatur, Ill., the nation's biggest ethanol producer, agreed to spend an estimated $350.9 million to settle charges it failed to accurately count emissions and expanded corn and oilseed processing facilities without installing proper pollution controls. The settlement filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois includes $213 million for new pollution controls over the next decade at 52 plants in 16 states. Those states are Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. It also includes $127 million to change the way it processes corn and oilseeds and to conduct environmental audits at all its facilities. Another $6.3 million will be spent to retrofit diesel engines in school buses and $4.6 million will go to a civil penalty. Sansonetti said the case builds on last year's settlement with 12 ethanol plants in Minnesota, the first time the federal government reached agreements mandating cuts in air pollution from manufacturers of corn-based ethanol, an additive in gasoline. Alcoa, Inc. of Pittsburgh, the world's largest aluminum producer, cast doubt on the $334.75 million settlement figure provided by the government. The Alcoa settlement _ which grew from a citizen group's complaint that its Rockdale, Texas, power plant improperly made changes that increased pollution _ was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Alcoa spokesman Kevin Lowery said it might be cheaper to close that coal-fired power plant and get energy elsewhere for its aluminum smelting facility there rather than spend the $330 million the government estimated it would cost to install new boilers. But the company will spend $2.5 million for conservation easements around the plant and $750,000 to retrofit school buses in Austin, Texas, and pay a $1.5 million civil penalty. Whitman said the agreements would reduce by 68,000 tons a year from Alcoa and by 63,000 tons a year from ADM emissions of air pollutants such as smog-causing nitrogen oxides and acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide. Sansonetti called it the first settlement of its kind involving the grain and oilseed processing industry. ADM spokeswoman Karla Miller said the company's new practices "will set the standard for our industry." The new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act date to 1977 and affect the way older industrial plants have to deal with air pollution when they expand, make major repairs or modify operations to increase efficiency. The Bush administration issued rules last year making it easier for industrial plants and refineries to modernize without having to buy expensive pollution controls, and it is still seeking changes what can be considered "routine maintenance, repair and replacement" at aging coal-burning power plants. Administration officials say their new approach removes barriers to production and innovation but opponents argue it undermines the Clean Air Act and is a giveaway to industry that lobbied heavily for easing the rules. ___ On the Net: EPA: http://www.epa.gov/air/nsr-review

 DON THOMPSON Associated Press Writer California sea otters' coastal environment may be so severely altered that scientists fear the species could be in jeopardy. Researchers at the University of California, Davis found the sea otters are dying in geographic clusters and from newfound diseases _ including a disease that makes them four times more likely to be killed by sharks. Their study came before 100 more southern sea otters washed up on California beaches this year, further reducing a population of about 2,000 that has been dwindling since 1995. The otters were hunted to near extinction for their luxuriously soft pelts by early in the last century. Their range once extended the length of the West Coast, but now is limited to California's central coast. In a normal population, the young and old are the most likely to die. But nearly half of the dead California otters _ 47 percent _ were in their adult prime, between the ages of 4 and 9 years old. Those otters also are in their prime breeding years, multiplying the impact of their loss. The researchers and the California Department of Fish and Game studied 105 adult sea otters, which are federally protected mammals, that died between February 1998 and June 2001. Disease killed nearly two-thirds _ 64 percent _ of the animals. Otters infected with one type of protozoa were four times more likely to be killed by sharks, the study revealed. The parasite invades the otter's brain where it can cause seizures, or make the animals confused or disabled. "They would be less able to evade sharks, more likely to swim to unprotected offshore waters, and more likely to shake and twitch, which attracts sharks," said the study's lead analyst, Christine Kreuder, a veterinarian at the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center. That parasite caused brain infections that killed half the otters found near Morro Bay. The shark attacks that can be a secondary cause of death, however, were clustered farther north, between Santa Cruz and Point Ano Nuevo. The parasite is found in domestic cat feces, while a second parasite is found only in opossums' droppings. A separate UC Davis study is trying to track how those land-based parasites get into the water, though storm water runoff is suspected. The study also said five of the six otters found along a 1 1/4-mile section of coastline in southern Monterey Bay died from eating a diet unusually high in sand crabs, which carry parasitic worms that can cause fatal abdominal infections. Heart disease also is killing otters, the researchers discovered, though they're now looking for the virus or bacteria they think is causing the unusual heart problems. The overall frequency of the disease deaths "indicates that the ecosystem is very unhealthy," said Jonna Mazet, who directs the university's Wildlife Health Center and leads its otter research programs. It's time to do something about it, urged Steve Shimek, executive director of The Otter Project, a nonprofit organization that focuses on research and conservation of the sea otter. "We know that the sea otter is in trouble. The (population) counts have gone down six of the last seven years. We also know we're losing our reproductive animals _ you can't do that forever before you crash" the population, Shimek said. "We know we have this problem. Can't we start working on the solution now?" he asked. That means better sewage treatment and banning the use of problem contaminants on shore, and controlling the accumulations in harbor areas where otters also congregate, Shimek said. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in April released a long-delayed recovery plan that blames human activities, from fishing and boating to pollution and oil spills, for the species' decline. Kreuder presented the findings at the International Association of Aquatic Animal Medicine annual meeting, and they are expected to be published in the July issue of Journal of Wildlife Disease. Results from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's annual spring otter count are expected in June. ___ On the Net: USGS Western Ecological Research Center: http://www.werc.usgs.gov California marine wildlife center: http://www.dfg.ca.gov/Ospr/marinewildlife/ The Otter Project: http://www.otterproject.org/is(underscore)sannicolas.html

 Michigan barred use on corn fields this year of a herbicide that has been blamed for contaminated water in other states. The Michigan Department of Agriculture rejected a request to allow Balance Pro use on the state's 2.2 million acres of corn this spring, Deputy Director of Agriculture Keith Creagh said Monday. Proponents of Balance Pro say many weeds have become resistant to herbicides already approved for use in the state. But Agriculture Director Dan Wyant followed a staff recommendation that warned of the product's potential risks. Those included contamination of surface and ground water, its classification as a probable human carcinogen and the state's inability to monitor the product's active chemical, isoxaflutole. Michigan already had temporarily banned the herbicide in 2001 and 2002, saying there was insufficient testing data. Balance Pro has been approved for use by 17 states but has been detected in stream in several of them, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA had approved Balance Pro, or isoxaflutole, in 1998 on a conditional basis, meaning states could outlaw its use. Last year, Wisconsin approved its use but with so many restrictions that the manufacturer decided not to sell it there. Minnesota also imposed severe restrictions on its use. "Lakes and reservoir samples in Nebraska and Missouri continued to show levels of Balance metabolites, some as late as 10 months after a single application," Kenneth Rauscher, director of the Pesticide and Plant Management Division of the Michigan Agriculture Department, wrote to Balance Pro's manufacturer, Bayer Crop Science. The company has said that there is no danger to groundwater and minimal concern over the chemical's accumulation in the environment. Conservationists praised the decision. "This is a really commendable action," said Dave Dempsey, policy adviser for the Michigan Environmental Council. "It is one of the few times I've seen the Ag Department act in a precautionary way." ___ On the Net: Michigan Department of Agriculture, http://www.michigan.gov/mda Bayer Crop-Science, http://www.bayercropscience.com/

 PIERRE SAUVEY Associated Press Writer Oil from a sunken tanker soiled France's southwestern coast Saturday, frustrating efforts by cleanup crews to contain the spreading pollution. Even as workers in white protective suits scooped up balls of oil with gloved hands, larger black clumps _ some as large as 18 inches across _ washed ashore. Local authorities appealed for extra help. "It's no longer little balls, but plates" of oil, said Col. Patrick Toufflet, a cleanup commander in the Landes region, south of Bordeaux, which mobilized about 100 workers, including soldiers and fire officers, on Saturday. Laboratory tests have traced oil from the Landes' beaches back to the aging tanker Prestige, which sank Nov. 19 off northwestern Spain. The tanker spilled thousands of tons of gluey oil, blackening vast swaths of the Spanish coast. Patches of oil began washing up along hundreds of miles of French beaches this week. Authorities in the Gironde region, north of the Landes, said Saturday that tests on oil found there confirmed that it also came from the Prestige. "The pollution … is on average twice what it was" on Friday, Paul Buchoux, a Gironde official, said Saturday. President Jacques Chirac vowed to go after ship owners and crews who try to sidestep maritime rules. "France and Europe will not allow shady businessman, rascals of the sea, to cynically profit from the lack of transparency," Chirac said Friday. Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, directed by Chirac to personally oversee management of the cleanup, also expressed outrage Friday as he trudged across oil-dirtied beaches at Cap Ferret, an Atlantic coastal town famous for its oyster beds. He promised an initial $52 million to help. The single-hulled Prestige was carrying 77,000 tons of oil when it sank. Spain's government drew stiff criticism at home for its handling of the oil slick _ notably for not acknowledging the scale of the disaster fast enough and failing to provide adequate resources for cleanup. Anxious to avoid similar criticism, Raffarin acted quickly to ease fears over the potential damage the slicks will have on the French fishermen and tourism.

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer Children are getting asthma at more than double the rate two decades ago, and one of every dozen women of childbearing age has blood mercury levels that could hinder brain development in a fetus, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday. EPA's report, only its second exhaustive roundup on environmental hazards to children's health, shows success in areas where the government has taken aggressive action, such as reductions in levels of children's blood lead poisoning and children's exposure to secondhand smoke. EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said the agency has done a lot to "improve the environment for children where they live, learn and play." Between 1980 and 1995, the report says, the percentage of children with asthma doubled, from 3.6 percent in 1980 to 7.5 percent in 1995. The percentage dropped in 1996 to about 6 percent, but by 2001 it had risen again, this time to 8.7 percent: 6.3 million children. Researchers don't know precisely why childhood asthma is increasing, but a number of factors in air quality, both outdoors and indoors, have been studied. Those varied factors include exposure to dust mites, cockroaches, pesticides, tobacco smoke, ozone and soot. The EPA says its officials are intent on examining the role of indoor air pollutants especially, since they note modest improvements in the numbers of children exposed to several outdoor air pollutants since 1990. About 5 million women _ 8 percent of those at the childbearing ages of 16 to 49 _ had at least 5.8 parts per billion of mercury in their blood as of 2000, the report says. EPA officials said this is the first time this kind of data has been measured. EPA has found that children born to women with blood concentrations of mercury above 5.8 parts per billion are at some risk of adverse health effects, including reduced developmental IQ and problems with motor skills such as eye-hand coordination. Mercury, a naturally occurring metal, is a persistent pollutant that accumulates in fish and becomes more concentrated as it moves up the food chain. The three major sources for mercury emissions have been power plants and municipal waste and medical waste incinerators. EPA has been regulating since the late 1990s mercury dumped in water and air from municipal waste and medical waste incinerators and considers it another success to have reduced levels emitted from each of those sources by 90 percent, EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said. The agency is writing regulations for mercury emitted from coal-fired power plants that are due to be completed in the next two years and are scheduled to take effect by 2007. The number of children with elevated levels of lead in their blood was 4.7 million in 1978 but had plunged to about 300,000 in 2000, the report says. EPA attributes most of that success to the phaseout of lead in gasoline between 1973 and 1995 and the reduction in the number of homes with lead-based paint from 64 million in 1990 to 38 million in 2000. The number of children whose blood levels showed effects from secondhand smoke declined by about one-fifth to one-half between 1988 and 2000, depending on levels of exposure. Those figures are obtained by tracking the amount of cotinine, a breakdown product of nicotine in blood. ___ On the Net: EPA: http://www.epa.gov

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer The Bush administration will propose abolishing a program begun under former President Clinton to reduce air pollution from older power plants once a nationwide cap on pollutants is set, EPA chief Christie Whitman said Wednesday. The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said the program no longer would be needed for power plants if Congress approves President Bush's "Clear Skies" plan. His proposal is intended to reduce the plants' emissions of acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide, smog-causing nitrogen oxide and mercury, a toxic chemical that contaminates waterways. Bush said last month he wants to set mandatory ceilings on total industry output and let companies earn and trade credits, with millions of tons of emissions projected to be reduced. If Congress goes along with the limits sought by Bush, the administration then would ask lawmakers to abolish the Clinton program, known as new source review, as it applies to power plants, Whitman said. But enforcement under the program would continue for refineries, paper mills and other industrial facilities, EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said. Bush wants to cut the current 11 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions each year to 4.5 million tons by 2010 and 3 million tons by 2018; the 5 million tons of nitrogen oxide emissions annually to 2.1 million tons by 2008 and 1.7 million tons by 2018; and mercury emissions from 48 tons a year to 26 tons by 2010 and 15 tons by 2018. "If the numbers are what the president proposed," Whitman said, and "we are actually getting, as I indicated, better reductions than under the current regulatory process … then new source review would become redundant and there would not be a need for it," she said. "That's not something we could do, that's something Congress would have to consider." In 1999, EPA and Justice Department officials began a more vigorous enforcement effort to make older power plants and refineries reduce their pollution. The Bush administration has drawn the ire of environmentalists and Democrats in Congress while preparing rule changes that might discourage new government lawsuits against operators of aging coal-fired power plants. The EPA will begin announcing its final plans for overhauling that program in the next few months. Environmentalists and congressional Democrats have expressed grave concerns about what the administration might do. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, contends that "special interests have been allowed to put their thumb" in the proposal, upsetting the proper balance. The Natural Resources Defense Council released internal EPA documents Wednesday that the environmental group said shows the EPA plans to let industries set fictional pollution-reduction targets while avoiding real limits for a decade or more. But Scott Segal, an attorney for six large utilities, said the president's approach makes obsolete the need for EPA's new source review for aging power plants. "Under a cap, old facilities and new facilities are treated the same," he said. ___ On the Net: Environmental Protection Agency: http://www.epa.gov National Resources Defense Council: http://www.nrdc.org

 H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer The head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday rejected environmentalists' complaints that an administration proposal to cut power plant pollution is a setback for cleaner air. EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said that President Bush's proposal is "the most aggressive initiative to cut air pollution in a generation" and will lower costs to industry while eliminating tons of chemicals that cause smog and acid rain and contaminate waterways with mercury. It will "achieve real air quality improvements," she told a seminar sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute and Brookings Institution. Since the plan was announced by the White House last week, it has been sharply attacked by environmentalists as a rollback of the progress already being made under a series of regulations that are on the books under the Clean Air Act. Environmentalists argue that some of the EPA's own projections of anticipated pollution reductions under its current rules would cut millions of additional tons of pollution than projected under the Bush proposal. Senior EPA officials strongly disagreed and said the numbers being cited by the environmental groups _ from an EPA briefing to industry last September _ were not intended to be accurate projections. "They do not reflect realistic projections," said EPA spokesman Joe Martyak. The Bush proposal, which will require congressional action, would replace many of the EPA's clean air rules with a broad market-based system of pollution caps and the authority to trade pollution credits as a way to achieve emission reductions, especially from older, coal-burning power plants. "We get dramatically greater reductions under the president's proposal than we could possibly get under the Clean Air Act," Jeffrey Holmstead, the head of the EPA's air office, told reporters Tuesday. Environmental groups said that some of the EPA's own internal analysis suggests that the Bush plan will allow 36 percent to 50 percent more pollution than would be allowed under current acid rain and smog-reducing regulations if they were fully implemented. At a briefing for the Edison Electric Institute last September, the EPA suggested that nitrogen oxide, the precursor to smog, could be cut by 75 percent to 1.25 million tons over the next decade under existing Clean Air Act rules, according to EPA documents obtained by environmental groups. Bush's market-based approach would cap nitrogen oxide at 2.1 million tons by 2008 and 1.7 million tons by 2018. The EPA presentation also envisioned sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, being reduced to 2 million tons under an EPA rule that will require reductions of soot and other microscopic particles. By comparison, the president's plan calls for a sulfur cap of 4.5 million tons by 2008 and 3 million tons by 2018. The Bush plan also envisions a push to regulate mercury from power plants, reducing these emissions from 48 tons today to 15 tons by 2018. The EPA is still developing a federal regulation to control mercury from power plants. According to EPA documents obtained by the National Environmental Trust, a leading environmental advocacy group, the EPA as recently as December estimated that mercury could be cut by as much as 90 percent, to 5.5 tons, if the best available technology were used under the planned regulations. "The president's plan is a Trojan horse for a rollback," argued Rebecca Stansfield of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an environmental group. Holmstead said the numbers from the September briefing were "never intended to be a projection of where we would be under the current Clean Air Act," although the presentation was labeled a summary of a "business as usual" scenario. Last Friday, a day after the president announced the new power plant initiative, Holmstead presented another set of projections to congressional staffers that showed the president's plan in a much better light. The projections presented Friday estimated that over the next decade, under current regulations, nitrogen oxide would be cut to 4 million tons, sulfur dioxide to 9.1 million tons, and mercury to 43 tons. All these reductions fall well short of what Holmstead said the president's plan would achieve. "It's an attempt by EPA to rewrite history," said John Stanton of the National Environmental Trust, citing the disparity between the EPA number last September and those last week. __ On the Net: Environmental Protection Agency: http://www.epa.gov/

 KENJI HALL Associated Press Writer Japan, the host of talks in Kyoto that yielded the world's first global warming agreement, praised President Bush's anti-pollution alternative but said Friday it hopes the United States will return to the treaty. Germany, meanwhile, criticized President Bush's proposal, saying it was unlikely to help lower emissions of greenhouse gases and allowed the United States "to escape responsibility" for environmental protection. Offering an alternative to the 1997 greenhouse gas accord, Bush on Thursday proposed a plan he said would encourage businesses to cut pollution and develop more energy-efficient technology. Bush also proposed stricter emissions standards for power plants. In Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi welcomed the proposal, saying it demonstrated Bush's commitment to reduce harmful greenhouse gases. But Kawaguchi, who was Japan's environment minister until early this month, said Tokyo will continue lobbying Washington to accept the Kyoto protocol. "Japan hopes that the U.S. government will actively engage in the climate change negotiations," she said. German Environment Minister Juergen Trittin said Bush's plan was "disappointing" because it was voluntary and failed to set targets for cuts by the world's biggest polluter. "We must not slam the door for a return of the United States under the Kyoto protocol's regime," he said. "We must not let the country with the biggest emissions of greenhouse gases worldwide escape responsibility for protecting the global climate." In Brussels, European Union Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstroem said Bush's plan is "no alternative" to the Kyoto protocol. Kyoto, she said, "is the only effective international framework for combating global warming and we urge the United States to return to the Kyoto process." Australian Prime Minister John Howard called Bush's proposal "a very positive thing." But he remains firmly against ratifying the Kyoto accord unless the United States adopts it. Last November, delegates from 163 countries met to finalize the wording of the 1997 Kyoto protocol _ the landmark agreement committing industrialized countries to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases blamed for warming the Earth's atmosphere. The pact commits nations to rolling back emissions to 1990 levels. The United States, which emits a quarter of the world's greenhouse gases, withdrew from the negotiations last March. Bush said the accord would hurt U.S. businesses and unfairly exempted heavily polluting countries such as India and China from reductions. Without the United States, the Kyoto protocol must be ratified by almost every other industrialized country to become a treaty. Environmental groups were skeptical of Bush's proposal, particularly because it relies on voluntary efforts. Japanese business groups urged Tokyo to discuss the U.S. plan with European countries and seek common ground. "The government should seek an international framework that integrates the U.S. proposal and the Kyoto protocol," said Takashi Imai, head of the Federation of Economic Organizations, or Keidanren, a powerful business lobby group. Bush's proposal came days before a scheduled six-day trip to Asia, where he will meet leaders in Japan, China and South Korea. Some environmentalists worry Bush may try to coax Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi into abandoning the Kyoto accord. But Japan's new environment minister, Hiroshi Oki, said he expected Parliament to ratify the accord by June, even without United States participation.

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer Environmental pollution in North America dropped 5 percent between 1995 and 2000, according to a new study by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation set up under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The study released Thursday said two of the most notable trends reflected in the overall decline are a 28 percent drop in the amount of chemicals emitted into the air and a 41 percent increase in the amount of chemicals sent largely to off-premise landfills. In 2000, the total amount of pollution released or transferred elsewhere in the United States, Canada and Mexico was 3.6 million tons _ 1.5 million tons of it going into the air, water or ground, the study says. Of the remainder, more than 1 million tons went to recycling operations and the rest was sent for treatment, energy recovery or disposal. "It's a good news-bad news picture. The large facilities are continuing to track downwards on their releases overall. But then when you look at the small 'p' polluters … they're tracking upward," said Victor Shantora, acting executive director of the Montreal-based commission. Electric utilities, steel mills, chemical makers and other industries in three states _ Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania _ and Canada's Ontario province accounted for as much as a fourth of the continent's pollutants, the study found. The five facilities reporting the largest total releases of pollution were operated by Kennecott Utah Copper in Magna, Utah; Chemical Waste Management in Arlington, Ore.; ASARCO Inc. in East Helena, Mont. and in Hayden Ariz.; and Magnesium Corp. of America in Rowley, Utah. Fourteen percent of the total pollution was in the form of chemicals such as styrene, lead and chromium and their compounds that are known or suspected carcinogens, the study said. Among the carcinogens, styrene was at the top of air pollutants _ more than 30,000 tons in 2000, the study said. The five biggest sources were facilities operated by Ameripol Synpol Corp. in Port Neches, Texas; Aguaglass Corp. in Adamsville and in McEwen, Tenn.; and Lasco Bathware Inc. in Cordele, Ga., and in Yelm, Wash. To establish the trend between 1995 and 2000, the study compares only those chemicals and industries that have consistently reported their pollution each of those years. Using those figures, the total amount of environmental pollutants released and transferred has decreased from 1.448 million tons in 1995 to 1.381 million tons in 2000. The study's authors noted that the trend shows several mixed pictures, reducing on-site releases in some cases but sending more wastes to landfills, treatment plants and other places away from their facilities. Larger polluters _ those reporting at least 110 tons annually _ showed a 7 percent decline in the amount of chemicals from 1998 to 2000, though they still accounted for about nine-tenths of all pollution reported. Smaller polluters _ those reporting less than 110 tons _ showed a 32 percent increase during that time. The study covers most industry in the United States and Canada, with companies in Mexico starting to voluntarily report figures. ___ On the Net: CEC: http://www.cec.org/home

 DuPont settled a chemical contamination case with people who said they were sickened by exposure to chemicals from a now-defunct DuPont munitions plant. Under the settlement, the company agreed to provide lifetime medical monitoring to 1,500 current and former residents, and allow 166 of the sickest to argue for monetary damages in front of an arbiter who will determine an award. Plaintiffs who get cancer also have the right to pursue additional compensation under the deal. DuPont admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement, which caps a 6-year-old case. DuPont operated the munitions plant in Pompton Lakes _ a working-class town of 10,000 residents _ for nearly a century before shutting it down in 1994. Residents allege lead, arsenic, mercury and other chemicals leaked from the site into soil and groundwater in the late 1980s. They claim the chemicals gave some people cancer, forced others to have hysterectomies and miscarriages and other ailments ranging from headaches and dizziness to depression.

 We applaud the judge who threw out a lawsuit seeking redress for people who live near Bhopal, even as we disagree with him. The 1984 gas leak killed thousands and poisoned the area. U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan said Union Carbide Corp., which had a 50.9 percent stake in the pesticide plant, had done enough and that too much time had passed. The judge cited Union Carbide’s 1994 sale of the property and construction of a hospital. Victims’ groups sought a medical monitoring program but were denied, with Keenan dismissing that as "extremely onerous on defendants, if not impossible." We agree that tracking down thousands of people thousands of miles away who were injured nearly 20 years ago would be a terrible burden. The time to set up medical monitoring was right away, and it is a grave oversight that it was not done. That doesn’t mean there’s nothing that can be done now. Some of the people who live near the contaminated site are desperately poor, lacking sanitary water. Some of the survivors of the Bhopal disaster were so disabled they have not been able to work since. There are doctors who seek answers about the exact chemical makeup of the gases leaked, and activists have gone so far as to appear at the home of Mike Parker, former Dow Chemical Co. chief executive officer, to reiterate that request. Even though Dow, which purchased Union Carbide as a wholly owned subsidiary, has tried to distance itself from the whole mess, we believe it has the resources available to find that information and provide it. Dow also has expertise in water purification membranes, and should consider offering those resources as well. We are not unsympathetic to Dow’s difficulties negotiating anything even remotely acceptable to Greenpeace and the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal. The two sides have talked, and seem not to get any closer to being able to work together to help the people of Bhopal. However, the site is owned by the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, and Dow has proven repeatedly it can work with government. Water systems and information dissemination are precisely the kinds of things governments can and should do, and it wouldn’t cost Dow very much to do so – in dollars. In goodwill, the company might even find it has gained.

 LUKAS I. ALPERT Associated Press Writer Most lower Manhattan residents are unlikely to suffer long-term illnesses from inhaling airborne pollution in the weeks after the World Trade Center collapse, the Environmental Protection Agency said. Citing measurements taken in and around the collapse zone, the draft report said Friday that only rescue workers and other people exposed to high concentrations of pollution immediately after the trade center attack are likely to develop chronic illnesses. It is unclear how many people inhaled smoke and dust from the collapse, some of which contained metals like lead and cadmium, PCBs, dioxin-like compounds, asbestos and other contaminants. The agency noted that no air testing was done until Sept. 14, 2001, so no definitive conclusions could be drawn about the first three days after the towers collapsed. Extensive testing did not begin until Sept. 18, the agency said. "It cannot be stated with certainty what effects resulted when people were engulfed in the initial cloud of dust or were subsequently exposed to the elevated concentrations that were found," the report said. Some lower Manhattan residents have criticized the EPA's response to their health worries about the smoke and dust that blanketed much of the area after the trade center attack. The main firefighters' union has claimed the city failed to provide firefighters enough respirators, leading to high rates of illness. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., who has pushed for long-term health monitoring of rescue workers and downtown residents, said Friday that the report does not end the debate. "We need to be diligent in continuing to monitor the short- and long-term health effects," she said. "We clearly have an obligation to provide health tracking services to the valiant men and women who worked at the trade center site." The EPA report comes a week after a team of private researchers and scientists said the chemical composition of the dust near ground zero appeared to be less toxic than initially feared. That study, to be published in the February issue of Environmental Science & Technology, also found that the particles collected were too large to lodge deep in people's lungs and cause long-term illness. ___ On the Net: EPA report: http://www.epa.gov/ncea/wtc.htm

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer The Bush administration will propose abolishing a program begun under former President Clinton to reduce air pollution from older power plants once a nationwide cap on pollutants is set, EPA chief Christie Whitman said Wednesday. The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said the program no longer would be needed for power plants if Congress approves President Bush's "Clear Skies" plan. His proposal is intended to reduce the plants' emissions of acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide, smog-causing nitrogen oxide and mercury, a toxic chemical that contaminates waterways. Bush said last month he wants to set mandatory ceilings on total industry output and let companies earn and trade credits, with millions of tons of emissions projected to be reduced. If Congress goes along with the limits sought by Bush, the administration then would ask lawmakers to abolish the Clinton program, known as new source review, as it applies to power plants, Whitman said. But enforcement under the program would continue for refineries, paper mills and other industrial facilities, EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said. Bush wants to cut the current 11 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions each year to 4.5 million tons by 2010 and 3 million tons by 2018; the 5 million tons of nitrogen oxide emissions annually to 2.1 million tons by 2008 and 1.7 million tons by 2018; and mercury emissions from 48 tons a year to 26 tons by 2010 and 15 tons by 2018. "If the numbers are what the president proposed," Whitman said, and "we are actually getting, as I indicated, better reductions than under the current regulatory process … then new source review would become redundant and there would not be a need for it," she said. "That's not something we could do, that's something Congress would have to consider." In 1999, EPA and Justice Department officials began a more vigorous enforcement effort to make older power plants and refineries reduce their pollution. The Bush administration has drawn the ire of environmentalists and Democrats in Congress while preparing rule changes that might discourage new government lawsuits against operators of aging coal-fired power plants. The EPA will begin announcing its final plans for overhauling that program in the next few months. Environmentalists and congressional Democrats have expressed grave concerns about what the administration might do. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, contends that "special interests have been allowed to put their thumb" in the proposal, upsetting the proper balance. The Natural Resources Defense Council released internal EPA documents Wednesday that the environmental group said shows the EPA plans to let industries set fictional pollution-reduction targets while avoiding real limits for a decade or more. But Scott Segal, an attorney for six large utilities, said the president's approach makes obsolete the need for EPA's new source review for aging power plants. "Under a cap, old facilities and new facilities are treated the same," he said. ___ On the Net: Environmental Protection Agency: http://www.epa.gov National Resources Defense Council: http://www.nrdc.org

 Caption Close For a long time political leaders in Southeast Texas were content to reap the many benefits from our petrochemical plants but do little about the downsides that affect the health and safety of people who live here. State Rep. Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, has broken out of that mindset, and it’s about time. Phelan has called for the Legislature to do a lot more in next year’s session to protect plant workers and residents from industrial disasters and dangerous pollutants. After countless reports of excessive pollution and the TPC explosion in November (along with last month’s blast in Houston at the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing plant), this isn’t a difficult position to take. The need for more action should be obvious, and that includes more Republicans who have traditionally been reluctant to support stronger business regulations. No one wants to hamper free enterprise, but company profits and worker’s paychecks can’t come at the expense of anyone’s health and safety. Most of the petrochemical plants in this region are quite profitable, and they can afford the basic precautions in operations and equipment to minimize any danger. Many of them do that, but some need a nudge in the right direction. “From Houston to Baton Rouge, major chemical and refining incidents are occurring more frequently,” Phelan said in a strongly worded statement. “In addition, elevated benzene levels have been reported in Southeast Texas and Houston over the last year. This is unacceptable. … While accidents do occur ... we must identify how these events could have been prevented and take legislative action.” Phelan cited more funding for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and that’s an excellent idea. Cities and counties in the region don’t have the expertise or staff to take on this complex challenge. But TCEQ does, and it could its job better with more resources — and tougher penalties for violations. Lawmakers also should require certain levels of insurance for industrial facilities to offset any costs to local communities for explosions or leaks. TPC is a large corporation and apparently has the resources to pay for the damage from its explosion. But in Houston, the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing plant was a much smaller facility, and it has already declared bankruptcy despite causing far more damage than the Port Neches blast. People in Houston who were injured by that explosion or saw extensive property damage may get no compensation. The Texas House and Senate must not ignore the dangerous trend line. Texans deserve to see a sharp reduction in these incidents, and legislative action can help make that happen.

 By James Osborne Refineries and chemical plants along the Houston Ship Channel. Refineries and chemical plants along the Houston Ship Channel. Caption Close Refineries and chemical plants along the Houston Ship Channel. Refineries and chemical plants along the Houston Ship Channel. WASHINGTON - Senate Republicans are pressing ahead on legislation loosening regulations dictating when industrial facilities need to upgrade their air pollution controls. The bill, which has a hearing in the Senate Wednesday, follows on from efforts by the Trump administration to limit when polluting facilities come under what the EPA terms the New Source Review Program, requiring often costly upgrades for refineries, power plants and petrochemical facilities. “The New Source Review program has held power plants and manufacturing factories back from improving efficiency," said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "Our legislation will cut government red tape and make it simpler for manufacturers to get the permits they need to improve their plants. The result will be cleaner, increased production.” POLLUTION DEBATE: In bid to speed up EPA, Pruitt takes on entrenched air pollution system But in doing so Republicans risk worsening air pollution in areas like Houston, where the prevalence of industrial facilities along the Houston Ship Channel has long caused the city to fall beneath federal air quality standards. John Walke, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the bill, "would let industries pollute more, by significantly higher amounts, and in the process, evade air pollution controls and pollution offsets in areas already experiencing unsafe air quality." But for petrochemical companies and the rest of the industrial sector, the numerous regulations they must comply with in order to expand or build new facilities has become so laborious a process they maintain it's sometimes better not to build. Jeff Holmstead, a Washington energy attorney and former assistant administrator for air and radiation at the EPA, described in written testimony ahead of the hearing a system that, "has become a Kafkaesque tangle of convoluted, burdensome and completely unnecessary regulations guidance documents, applicability determinations, and court decisions." "In some parts of the country, it effectively bans the construction of new facilities even if they use state-of-the-art pollution controls and would not have a meaningful impact on the environment – and even though the communities where they would be located desperately want them to be built," he wrote.

 By Perla Trevizo Caption Close While the remnants of Tropical Depression Imelda contributed to the release of less overall air pollution than initially estimated, the region saw some increases in emissions, including of cancer-causing benzene, state reports show. Overall, industrial businesses released about 81,000 pounds of pollutants, according to final reports submitted to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality — down from early estimates of nearly 95,000 pounds. Initially, about a dozen facilities reported unauthorized releases from Sept. 18 through 21, triggered by electrical outages, the failure of floating roof tanks and equipment malfunctions caused by flooding from the storm, which brought more than 40 inches of rain in 72 hours in some parts of Southeast Texas. Together, these companies concentrated in Jefferson, Harris and Brazoria counties reported releasing toxins, including cancer-causing 1,3 butadiene, benzene and ethylene oxide. Companies have 24 hours to report unauthorized emissions but can make revisions within two weeks. When a big storm strikes, refineries and other chemical facilities are especially vulnerable. Plants may shut units down in advance as a precaution and then restart after the storm, which can lead to the release of harmful pollutants. During Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the industry reported releasing 8.3 million pounds of nonpermitted air pollution, according to an analysis of state data by the Environmental Integrity Project in Austin. “Both benzene and 1,3 butadiene are cancer-causing toxic air pollutants of great concern in Houston. There is no safe level of exposure to these pollutants,” said Loren Hopkins, chief environmental science officer for the Houston Health Department. “While we don’t really know the long-term consequences of spikes such as those that have occurred during emergencies like Harvey,” she said, “we do know that we need to limit exposure to them as much as possible. It is important to know the correct amount of emissions in a timely fashion to inform public health decisions.” About 336 pounds of benzene were released in Harris County, a 44 percent increase from initial estimates, but the bulk of the carcinogen, nearly 1,200 pounds, were released in Jefferson County, home to Beaumont and Port Arthur, according to an analysis of state data by Air Alliance Houston and verified by the Houston Chronicle. Another 2,100 pounds of 1,3 butadiene were reportedly released in all three counties. Some plants file initial reports as a precaution; others make revisions after determining the emissions were below thresholds for reporting or authorized by a permit. Companies use a wide range of tools to make the estimates, including process data and engineering calculations, according to reports submitted to the state. The decrease in emissions was largely due to revisions from Exxon Mobil Corp. facilities in Harris and Jefferson counties, TCEQ data show. In the aftermath of Imelda, the Beaumont chemical plant reported releasing about 36,500 pounds of pollutants over 24 hours as a result of having to shut down. But in the final report, the company revised its estimates to about 30,300 pounds. The Baytown facility revised early estimates of emissions from 5,300 pounds of volatile organic compounds over 48 hours, when the storm caused a floating roof to fail, to about 3,000 pounds. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.’s Beaumont chemical plant also reported releasing about 4,500 pounds of pollutants, 76 percent less than initially estimated. However, the company later estimated that between Sept. 29 and Oct. 21 it would release nearly 31,000 pounds of carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides (which are ozone precursors). Goodyear attributed this to unscheduled startups of five units that had to shut down due to flooding and electricity loss caused by Imelda, according to initial reports to the TCEQ. Most other facilities reported some increases, such as Equistar Chemicals LP in La Porte, which added 2,548 pounds of net emissions, mostly carbon monoxide and propane. Meredith Matthews, a spokeswoman for Houston-based LyondellBasell, which Equistar is part of, said the company adheres to TCEQ’s regulations that require initial notification based on preliminary information, followed by a final report that includes more detailed information wthin two weeks after the emissions event ends. “We strive to limit our impact to the environment and work to operate safely and responsibly,” she said in a written statement. “These revisions appear to be typical of emissions event final reports,” said Matt Van Vleck, air supervisor with Harris County Pollution Control. “In all, Harris County fared remarkably well in terms of emissions events given the magnitude of the flooding event and in comparison to the 3.5 million pounds of volatile organic compounds emitted as a result of Harvey.” The department is still investigating. The major takeaway from the reports is the need for better information about what communities are potentially exposed to and the quantities during extreme weather events such as Harvey or Imelda, said Corey Williams, research and policy director at Air Alliance Houston. “If the facility doesn’t know what it’s emitting or what quantities, the community is even more in the dark, with no idea what they are being exposed to in these events,” he said. While some pollution releases during natural disasters may be unavoidable, there are improvements the state and the industry can make to minimize emissions, the Environmental Integrity Project wrote in its 2018 report after Harvey, “Preparing for the Next Storm.” Among other things, the D.C.-based nonprofit, recommended that: TCEQ plan, coordinate, and stagger shutdowns of major industrial facilities during hurricanes and other disasters, as well as the subsequent firing up of plants, to minimize pollution impacts ; Refineries and other petrochemical plants better prepare in advance of hurricanes; TCEQ develop a plan and obtain equipment necessary to accurately monitor air quality during these events. This week, TCEQ announced an investment of more than $1.5 million to improve the agency’s air-monitoring capabilities, including being able to provide communities and local governments more real-time data during natural disasters or accidents. The state’s environmental agency plans to equip up to three vans with real-time, mobile air-monitoring technology and add three fixed air-monitoring stations, in addition to 15 handheld monitors the agency already bought. About two-thirds of the money was included in the most recent state budget, with the remainder coming from savings in the environmental agency’s 2019 budget. “This new equipment will expand TCEQ’s ability to rapidly assess air quality, particularly around petrochemical facilities, but it will also help with daily monitoring of ambient conditions, including the Houston Ship Channel area,” Toby Baker, the agency’s executive director, said in a news release. perla.trevizo@chron.com

 Midland Daily News A 10-year-old girl set a big example for young and old when she recently saw a lot of trash that had accumulated in a roadside ditch in southern Gladwin County. She decided she was old enough, strong enough and smart enough to go clean it up. It had nothing to do with Earth Day, although the cleanup began this spring, and produced a local newspaper story that was just in time to coincide with Earth Day, the annual celebration of our world. Mackenzie Knake set an example for all of us when she just decided that trash and water bottles don't belong in ditches. Just like fast-food bags and plastic cups and cigarette butts and all the other things that motorists throw out their windows. While this girl can clean up the mess near her property, and set an example for every property owner in the Great Lakes Bay Region, what she cannot do is give a good lecture to the less respectful people who regularly pollute nature. Parents should be teaching their children that it is a poor habit and often breaking the law to dispose of trash improperly. We also trust that most schools are getting that word out -- especially during weeks like this one that correspond with Earth Day. Corporations, like Dow, are also coming through with larger contributions to major throwaway problems, like the plastic that is accumulating in our oceans. Hearing and seeing a young girl cleaning up a roadside should make all of us think twice about pollution and taking responsibility for our own property. It doesn't have to be Earth Day to make smart decisions about our planet. This is something we can do every day. Thanks, Mackenzie, for reminding us how it's done.

The Cypress Creek Watershed Partnership is working to improve the water quality of Cypress Creek. A section of Cypress Creek near Towne Lake. The Cypress Creek Watershed Partnership is working to improve the water quality of Cypress Creek. A group of local stakeholders continues working to identify, measure and mitigate direct causes of water pollution in Cypress Creek. The Cypress Creek Watershed Partnership whose members include local government figures, business owners and residents, began hosting public meetings earlier this year to spread the partnership’s message and form a steering committee. The 11-member committee is overseeing the creation of a watershed protection plan, or WPP, to reduce the amount of water pollution within Cypress Creek. Related: Community-led committee to work on fixing Cypress Creek water quality On Nov. 14 and 19, the CCWP hosted work group meetings to discuss possible direct causes for water pollution and brainstorm ideas for measuring those causes. According to data already collected by the CCWP, fecal waste from pets — specifically pet dogs — accounts for approximately 80 percent of the bacteria in the creek. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Houston-Galveston Area Council are facilitating the partnership’s strategy development process with help from a grant provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Justin Bower, senior planner with H-GAC, led the meetings, which he said are meant to gather recommendations and information for the partnership before the steering committee approves recommendations for the next phase of reducing waste in the watershed. Human waste During the Nov. 14 work group meeting at Barbara Bush Library, Bower met with interested community members and local stakeholders to discuss human-related sources, including pet waste. The partnership website states that certain sections of the watershed’s waterways have levels of fecal contaminants exceeding Texas’ limit for recreational use. The fecal contamination comes from a variety of sources, including human wastewater and animals, according to the website. Bower said human waste is more likely to get humans sick than animal waste or other sources. Related: Fecal matter in Cypress Creek prompts watershed protection plan Attendees suggested better educating other community members about the dangers of exposure to stormwater due to pollution, more frequent unannounced testing of wastewater treatment plants, and reinforcing the importance of picking up waste from pets. Part of the issue is knowing generally what kind of waste is coming in-stream, but not being able to pinpoint where exactly the sources of pollution are the worst. For instance, data collected at wastewater treatment plants is being accounted for in the WPP, but the exact levels of pollution along the waterway are not specified. “We recommend looking for resources to do additional in-stream targeted sampling,” Bower said. “Let’s say we have an issue with one tributary. Do some targeted sampling up and down there so we can start to say, ‘It’s good here, it’s good here, what’s in between those.’” Bower said when contaminant sources are found, then the CCWP can work with Harris County and the TCEQ to address those sources contributing to water quality issues. Bower said the CCWP is speaking with apartment complexes and neighborhoods to get a better sense of how many people pick up their pet waste and if they have the resources available to do so, such as pet waste disposal stations. The information gathered may result in a lower documented percentage of waste from pets than was previously thought. “We just assumed when we populated dog numbers that those dogs are producing waste that is making it to the stream, which isn’t necessarily the case,” he said. “We’ll find a conservative estimate to reduce that number by to reflect ownership.” Livestock and wildlife waste While livestock waste, including cows, horses, goats, sheep and pigs, may not be the largest contributor to the pollution of Cypress Creek, Bower said it is still an issue for the partnership to address during the work group meeting about agriculture, wildlife and invasive species’ impact on water quality Nov. 18 at the Weekley Community Center. Currently the CCWP is looking for more direct measurement of livestock populations near the waterways to determine the actual impact and significance of their waste. Bower said the CCWP is already aware they need to reduce their previously measured impact of animal waste on Cypress Creek downstream. “When we looked at the numbers initially, we had about 10 percent of the total amount of watershed coming from cattle or livestock,” he said. “Unsurprisingly most of them are out on the prairie or west of (SH)99. We looked at the cattle numbers versus the stocking rates that some of the district board members suggested ... and our numbers were actually pretty close.” Mary Anne Piacentini, executive director of the Katy Prairie Conservancy, said the conservancy is working to keep cattle from polluting the waterways. “On Warren Ranch all of our streams now are fenced off so the cattle are not getting into our streams,” she said. “So, you’ve got 600 cattle that aren’t getting to the stream that way. The hope is that we’re going to be able to do more of that on our other properties if we get to convert all of our herds.” Just like with other sources, the closer the source is to the stream, within a buffer that the CCWP has determined, the more impact their waste will have on the waterway. Bower said waste from agriculture is not necessarily the main issue, but it still needs to be stopped and people need to be warned to avoid contact with the water if possible. As for species like feral hogs and deer, sparse data is present for either group right now. Feral hogs can be a problem for the watershed due to their high reproductive rates, tendency to destroy vegetation and destabilize streams, along with their waste, Bower said. Bower said feral hog concentrations are higher in the western portion of Harris County with less development. “The largest percent (of waste feral hogs produce) in any of the watershed is about 4 percent before we move the numbers so they’re going to be probably about 6 or 7 (percent) in the western most part,” he said. Deer waste contribution data is also sparse but needs measurement. Bower said data is needed for all other wildlife, but probably won’t be a major consideration unless they have a large impact in larger numbers. For instance, birds are not perceived as having as large of an impact as other sources. What now? The CCWP will host a public meeting Nov. 21 to provide information on past meetings and receive more feedback and suggestions for the WPP. Information about the partnership and future efforts can be found at https://cypresspartnership.weebly.com/. Bower suggested citizens do all they can to prevent waste from polluting waterways by attending CCWP meetings and doing their part within their daily life. “We’re not talking about the old days of the smoke stack coming out of the factory, we’re talking about the cumulative impact of everything everyone’s doing,” he said. “Walk your dog? Pick it up. It’s better than drinking it.” chevall.pryce@chron.com

 By Macklin Reid A Ridgefield town truck clears Bennett’s Farm Road of snow and ice. Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017 A Ridgefield town truck clears Bennett’s Farm Road of snow and ice. Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017 Caption Close A Ridgefield town truck clears Bennett’s Farm Road of snow and ice. Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017 A Ridgefield town truck clears Bennett’s Farm Road of snow and ice. Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017 Winter’s ice and snow will return, and the town’s red trucks will be out spreading a salt-based product on the roads to help keep them clear — for another year, anyway. But a committee of town officials will be undertaking what they envision as a wide-ranging study of what other communities around the nation do, seeking alternatives to putting salt on the roads — where it drains into and pollutes groundwater, aquifers, wetlands and watercourses. “There’s really no alternative to salt,” Dave Buccitti of the town highway department told the Board of Selectmen. Buccitti, Public Works Director Peter Hill, Planning and Zoning Director Richard Baldelli and Planning and Zoining Commission Chairwoman Rebecca Mucchetti joined the selectmen’s Aug. 21 meeting for a discussion of using salt on the roads, and the environmental implications of the practice. First Selectman Rudy Marconi said that at a meeting earlier in the year of Western Connecticut Council of Governments, the regional planning agency Ridgefield belongs to, a representative of the state Department of Health’s Public Drinking Water Section had said wetlands running along highways show signs of the problem that use — or, at least, overuse — of ice-melting products can create. “There is no sign of any wildlife,” he said, “ because of the salt.” Additives “The salt we use, it’s treated. It’s supposed to be environmentally-friendly,” said Hill. Ice-thawing products use a variety of additives — “molasses, beet juice, pickle juice” — but always in combination with salt, Buccitti said. Salt alone is effective only down to about 27 degrees Fahrenheit, Hill said, and the various additives lower the temperature range in which it is effective. But none of that will address the long-term problem of salt polluting groundwater, which the selectmen have been talking about since they were addressed on the concern some months by a well driller, Henry Boyd. Thursday’s meeting kicked around some ideas. “We could go back to sand and salt,” Marconi said. For many years the town used a sand-salt mixture, but for the last eight years — since 2007-08 — the town dropped the sand and has been using a “straight salt” treatment on icy roads. In the old days snowy roads were simply covered with sand, but sand alone becomes less useful in providing traction once it begins to be “pulverized” by traffic rolling over it, according to Public Works Director Hill. “Sand is good for the first 12 cars,” he said. Sherman’s woes Marconi spoke of the problems in nearby Sherman, where the town has been doing studies to figure out what to do about five public wells that had been polluted with road salt. “The wells were shallow, 40 to 80 feet,” Marconi said. Sherman has reportedly spent tens of thousands of dollars on bottled water for public buildings, and voters there will soon be asked to appropriate $15,000 for drilling a new well to serve the town’s firehouse and a playhouse — but the town isn’t even sure this will solve the problem, and it may also have to address problems with the well serving Sherman Town Hall. Marconi said that the state’s “allowable limit” for salt in drinking water is 28 milligrams per liter and drinking water in Ridgefield could surpass that “if we continue our current trend in five to eight years.” Marconi said he’d asked state authorities about the problem. “I said, ‘How are we going to address it?’ They said, ‘We already have. We’re going to raise the limit to 100.’ ” That might address legal and bureaucratic issues, but it wouldn’t reduce health concerns related to the level of salt in the drinking water. Public Works Director Hill said the state Department of Transportation had in recent years been using a different product on its highways. “They switched to magnesium chloride — which is killing our bridges,” Hill said. Marconi said the road treatments also create a problem with the undersides of vehicles — brake lines, transmission lines — rotting out within six, seven, eight years. Hill noted that road salt might not be the only — or even the biggest — contributor to salt in Ridgefield’s groundwater. “Fifty percent of homes in Ridgefield are being treated with water softeners,” he said. “...How does that affect someone, versus putting salt on the road?” Study committee The interdepartmental study committee that will be looking into winter road treatments includes Dave Buccitti and Peter Hill for the Public Works Department, Planning and Zoning Director Richard Baldelli, Assistant Planner Daniel Robinson, Wetlands Agent Beth Peyser, and P&Z administrator Aarti Paranjape, as well as selectmen Marconi and Kozlark. Baldelli described for the Aug. 21 meeting the ambitious approach the study committee will take in looking for potential solutions. “What we anticipate doing is, initially, research,” Baldelli said. “We’re going to look at it countrywide. We’re going to see what other agencies do — especially in sensitive areas, like the Great Lakes and Mississippi River,” he said. “Snow removal in the Northeast is different from Minnesota — we have freeze-thaw, freeze-thaw,” Baldelli said. One of the questions will be “whether there’s a way to quantify the actual damage from various products,” he said. “There’s a variety of things we’re going to look into,” Baldelli said. “One addition I wanted to make is liability,” Marconi said. “Whatever we do we want to make sure we’re not creating liability.” “Safety is our number one issue,” said Baldelli. “We’d never compromise that.” The committee’s first meeting was on Thursday, Aug. 22, and Selectwoman Kozlark said afterwards that while the work would take some time, she was hopeful it would be productive in the long run. “Planning is taking the lead on studying the effects and possible approaches to mitigate the salt usage,” Kozlark said. “It was an initial step and nothing will be implemented until fully vetted for safety and health of the town.” She added, “At this time the town doesn’t have a good alternative to the ‘Ice B’Gone.’ I think it is encouraging that the town is initiating this discussion with the intent of some kind of implementation in the future.”

 Caption Close The operational changes approved last week for the Oxbow Calcining plant in Port Arthur are supposed to reduce the pollution coming from its smokestacks, and Port Arthur residents will be hoping that happens. But the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shouldn’t regulate on the basis of hope or good intentions. That state agency should be focused on hard data and measurable improvements. It must monitor this plant closely in the coming months to answer a simple question: Is more or less pollution is being emitted from Oxbow’s smokestacks? As it is, Oxbow discharges more than 2,000 tons per year of sulfur dioxide. Because of that dubious distinction, it is one of several plants across the nation required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to have an air-quality monitor nearby. Yet some local and environmental activists are concerned that this change will make it harder to measure exactly what is being discharged into the sky. The change essentially allows Oxbow to exclusively release exhaust at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Previously, it released exhaust out of three smokestacks at 400 degrees Fahrenheit and 2,000 degrees from one additional. But one activist said that with the additional heat, the emissions could be going up and over the nearest air-quality monitor, ending up in a different part of Port Arthur. If that happens, there’s no net improvement in Port Arthur’s air quality. The sulfur dioxide might be affecting a different neighborhood more, but clearly no one can be satisfied with a shift like that. Oxbow officials maintain that they are operating within the limits of state and federal permits, and that may be true in a technical sense. But that all hinges on accurate monitoring of emissions, which is precisely what this change could affect. As it is, one monitor has been temporarily relocated because of construction in the area, and the state agency is working with the EPA to evaluate sites for a permanent location. This issue reinforces a basic point about the petrochemical plants in the region: Southeast Texans appreciate the jobs and tax revenues they produce, but that prosperity can’t come at the expense of our health and safety. Most plants do meet this environmental challenge and still make a profit. With better technology, that’s much more doable than years ago. Oxbow Calcining should be able to meet this standard, too, and state and federal regulators must ensure that it does.

 Jordyn Hermanijordyn.hermani@hearstnp.com In an effort to invest and develop in new global initiatives and solutions that work to prevent and remove plastic waste in the environment, Dow Chemical Co. will be joining a $100 million effort to finance companies and infrastructure that prevent waste in oceans. The announcement was made during a recent Our Ocean Conference in Bali, Indonesia. Dow will be joining several other major global brands to become a founding investor in Circulate Capital. The company also announced at the conference that it intends to donate an additional $1 million to Ocean Conservancy over the next two years to support waste collection and recycling solutions in Southeast Asian countries. This money would be used for projects that build the capacity of local non-governmental organizations and partnerships with city leaders to develop, scale and replicate implementable solutions. "Dow is leading the way in our industry -- by applying circular economy logic, collaborating across the value chain, innovating new products, and through the commitment of our employees and customers -- to put an end to plastic waste in the environment," said Jim Fitterling, chief executive officer of Dow, in a press release. "We will continue to seek opportunities to work with our industry partners, brand owners, local, national and international governments, NGOs and consumers to ensure that we develop true circular economy solutions for plastics." Circulate Capital's mission is to demonstrate the viability of investment in the waste management and recycling sectors to attract the institutional investment capital needed to scale integrated recycling and waste management companies and infrastructure across South and Southeast Asia. These regions have been identified as contributing disproportionately to ocean plastic pollution primarily because they lack the critical waste infrastructure to manage the problem. Circulate Capital expects to receive $100 million in combined funding from a variety of the world's leading consumer packaged goods and chemical companies. Ocean Conservancy is working to protect the ocean from today's greatest global challenges. Together with its partners, the organization creates science-based solutions for a healthy ocean and the wildlife and communities that depend on it. Dow has been partnering with Ocean Conservancy for more 20 years. As a major sponsor of the organization's annual International Coastal Cleanup, Dow and Ocean Conservancy founded the Trash Free Seas Alliance in 2012, a coalition of businesses, academics and NGOs, to analyze and address upstream causes of ocean plastic pollution.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency held a press in September in Durham to announce construction had begun on installation of a new water line to provide clean drinking water to the residences and MIDDLETOWN — Clean drinking water, the absence of which has plagued more than four dozen households and firms along a section of Main Street for 30 years, will become a reality in two years, thanks to the cooperation of countless agencies and individuals. In all, 50 private wells serving 54 locations are contaminated, requiring the distribution of bottled water and the installation of carbon treatment systems as a temporary solution, according to Environmental Protection Agency officials, who celebrated the momentous occasion Tuesday at the Durham Meadows Superfund Site. Federal, state and local officials converged on 281 Main St. to herald the start of a $24.4 million construction project for a water line from Middletown to the town center, work expected to be complete in 2020. Superfund areas are thousands of contaminated sites across the nation that exist due to dumping of hazardous waste, left out in the open, or otherwise improperly managed. These sites include manufacturing facilities, processing plants, landfills and mining sites, according to the EPA. First Selectwoman Laura Francis summed up the feelings of frustration that have permeated discussions for years. “Today is the day that the emotions of the town of Durham residents, which have been concern, fear and anger, change to comfort, relief and gratitude,” she said. #Middletown Mayor Drew talks at presser announcing construction of new waterline from city to #Durham Meadows Superfund site off Main Street - explains parents’ fears of carcinogens #2/2 pic.twitter.com/fEpu4TprRf Francis recalled inheriting the project 12 years ago, when she was first elected. “Leadership matters, expect results” was the campaign slogan that carried her to political victory, Francis said. Since that time, the first selectwoman has discovered the true meaning of such a promise, she told the nearly three dozen people gathered on the sunny morning. “Leadership means that, without a title, without authority over the final decision, without any personal reward, you work to do the right thing. You do the thing that is just for the people,” she said. Nearly six miles of water line — about 30,000 feet — will be installed to allow connection to Middletown’s water system of 120 homes and industrial firms, including Coginchaug High School, Strong Middle School and the Durham Fairgrounds, officials said. #Middletown Mayor Drew talks at presser announcing construction of new waterline from city to #Durham Meadows Superfund site off Main Street - explains parents’ fears 1/2 of carcinogens pic.twitter.com/MgvG4Alo5t EPA Regional Administrator Dennis Deziel was joined by Col. William Conde of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes, and Middletown Mayor Dan Drew to celebrate the groundbreaking. It will connect residents whose wells are impacted by the site to a public water supply. For more than a decade, residents have been using potable water for drinking. The site includes land owned by the Durham Manufacturing Co. and the former Merriam Manufacturing Co. Both firms used various chlorinated solvents, including trichloroethene, which has been detected in groundwater in concentrations as high as 1,400 parts per billion (280 times the safe level), according to the EPA. A large area of contamination and the associated source areas were designated as the Durham Meadows Superfund Site in 1989, the EPA said. “The solution to this problem was far from elegant. It didn’t fit in a box with a big bow on top of it. It was messy, and, at time, elusive,” Francis said. The work necessitated the forming of strategic partnerships, she added. “It’s a model for other communities to emulate.” The project will encompass the building of an 800,000-gallon water storage tank at the top of the Talcott Ridge in Middletown, which also will provide fire protection, according to AECOM Project Manager Richard M. Berlandy. EPA Regional Administrator Dennis Deziel said restoring clean drinking water and returning land to protected use is his agency’s top priority. “We’ve made substantial progress,” he said. DEEP is paying for 10 percent of construction costs. Ninety percent of the funding comes from federal partners, Dykes said. “We know it’s been a long road to get here. There were a lot of solutions to consider, a lot of different alternatives, but this type of collaboration — [municipalities] coming together — to provide the most critical assurance around clean drinking water for the community of Durham is absolutely essential,” she added. Francis summed up the import of Tuesday’s announcement. “Having this project complete will be the most transformational thing that has happened to Durham since, possibly, the [discovery of] the contamination, which will “revitalize” Main Street, as well as provide much-needed fire protection, she added. “Like the colonel said, ‘Let’s move some dirt!’”

 EPA wants to clamp down on emissions in Texas. Emissions that contribute to ozone pollution come from refineries and major petrochemical plants such as ExxonMobil and other motor fuels refineries in Southeast Texas and chemical plants that make synthetic rubber or chemicals used in making plastics. These emissions can combine with heat and sunlight to form ozone at ground level and is considered a pollutant that can harm people. That is why the EPA wants more control of these emissions.

Valentino Mauricio/The Enterprise EPA wants to clamp down on emissions in Texas. Emissions that contribute to ozone pollution come from refineries and major petrochemical plants such as ExxonMobil and other motor fuels refineries in Southeast For years the biggest challenge to air quality in Southeast Texas has come from the four major oil refineries that make their home here. But a recent study by the Environmental Integrity Project identified 90 plants from Port Arthur to Houston that make plastics — and which emitted 55,704 tons of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides in 2017. That’s a lot of emissions, especially since this issue has largely been under the radar until reports like this come out. The plants themselves must strive to reduce this output as much as possible every year. In turn, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must make sure they are operating safely and efficiently. The plastics industry is already estimated to be responsible for about a fourth of the air pollution in the region, but this is also the fastest-growing segment of the petrochemical business. The number of new plastics plants and expansion projects could double in coming years. Much of that growth stems from the surge in cheap natural gas supplies that fuel these plants. Yet according to the EIP study, nearly two-thirds of the 90 plastics plants studied had violated air-pollution limits over the last five years. Many of these discharges could be reduced since they were attributed to failures to properly test and maintain piping, pumps and controls. Moreover, the costs for these violations need to be stiffer. The EIP report found that state regulators imposed penalties on violators for only 57 of 872 unpermitted emissions producing about 11 million pounds of air pollution. Yet the fines for all these violations totaled only $665,000 — about 6 cents per pound of illegal pollution. That’s not good enough. The fines should produce a real incentive to follow state and federal laws instead of being regarded as a minor annoyance to be paid and forgotten. This should concern plant officials, too, since their workers and managers breathe the same air as the rest of us, and they’re even closer to the source of potential pollution. The technology to reduce pollution and operate efficiently gets better each year. It must be matched by a real desire by plant officials to operate cleanly and safely — all the time. The jobs and tax revenues from these plants is welcome, of course. But it cannot come at the expense of our air quality, now or later on.

FILE-- An offshore oil rig docked for repairs in Sabine Pass, Texas, Nov. 4, 2018. The Trump administration on Sept. 12, 2019, is completed the legal repeal of a major Obama-era clean water regulation, which WASHINGTON - For years, the fight over how much power the federal government should have to regulate the wetlands and tributaries that feed into the nation's largest rivers has played out across the country. In the halls of Washington and on sprawling farms and ranches, in courtrooms and corporate boardrooms, a legal tug of war has unfolded over a 2015 rule that gave the Environmental Protection Agency much broader authority over the nation's waterways. Critics say the Obama rule gave the federal government far too much power; supporters countered that it would prevent the loss of vast swaths of wetlands. Court rulings have temporarily blocked the regulation in 28 states, while keeping it in effect in 22 others. On Thursday, the Trump administration plans to scrap the Obama-era definition of what qualifies as "waters of the United States" under the Clean Water Act, returning the country to standards put in place in 1986. "What we have today is a patchwork across the country," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview. "We need to have a uniform regulatory approach." Wheeler, who said the administration will finalize a new definition for which water bodies deserve federal protection within a matter of months, said the agency is seeking to end any lingering uncertainty and return more oversight to individual states. "We want to make sure that we have a definition that once and for all will be the law of the land in all 50 states," Wheeler said. But critics say the rollback will speed the conversion of wetlands and headwaters, which provide critical habitat for wildlife and support the nation's drinking water supply. Americans drained about half of the 220 million acres of wetlands in the contiguous United States between the 1780s and 1980s, most of it to expand farmland. That rate began to slow after George H.W. Bush took the White House, pledging to stem the tide of wetlands loss. "The administration wants to go back to an era where we are destroying wetlands heedlessly," Robert Irvin, president of American Rivers, said of President Donald Trump's latest deregulatory effort. The 2015 rule gave the federal government authority to oversee a wide array of lakes, streams, wetlands, storm-water controls and ditches that feed into larger waterways that are clearly protected under the 1972 Clean Water Act. Denise Stranko, federal legislative and policy manager for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, noted that all but one of the six states in the bay's watershed, along with the District of Columbia, operate under the Obama-era standard. She added that once the administration finalizes its substitute proposal, tens of thousands of acres that connect underground or through ditches to nearby waterways will lose protection. Targeting the Obama-era regulation ranked among Trump's top priorities when he took office. In February 2017, he issued an executive order directing the EPA to review the regulation in an effort to pave the way for what Trump called "the elimination of this very destructive and horrible rule." The Clean Water Act makes it unlawful to pollute a "water of the United States" without a permit, but what constitutes such water has been the subject of lengthy litigation. In a 2006 decision, Rapanos v. United States, the Supreme Court's four most conservative justices at the time offered a constrained view that only "navigable waters" met this test. But Justice Anthony Kennedy, who refused to join either the conservatives or the liberals, said that the government could intervene when there was a "significant nexus" between large water bodies and smaller ones. Trump's executive order said federal officials should rely on the opinion of Justice Antonin Scalia, who argued that the law should apply only to "navigable waters." Wheeler is slated to announce the final repeal of the 2015 rule at the National Association of Manufacturers, whose members had pushed to scale it back. "America is now one step closer to smart and balanced regulation that protects our nation's precious water resources," the group's president, Jay Timmons, said in a statement. Thursday's move is part of a broader effort by the administration to roll back regulations affecting the private sector by the end of Trump's first term. Among the dozens already reversed: easing rules on practices such as curbing methane emissions from drilling operations and holding oil and gas companies responsible for killing birds that get ensnared in their rigs' waste pits. "We will finalize all of our top priorities," Wheeler said. Several of the administration's early wins came through the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to nullify any rule within 60 days of enactment. The Republican-controlled Congress in 2017 was able to overturn several of President Barack Obama's last environmental acts that way, sending the bills to Trump for his signature. But reversing older regulations, such as the Clean Water Rule, has proved more difficult. Wheeler said it was taking longer than first anticipated to finalize the administration's new standards because staffers were conducting economic and scientific research to bolster the case for shrinking the federal government's authority over wetlands and streams. "I'm not in a rush to meet artificial deadlines," he said. "I want to make sure that our regulations are grounded, that they have all the supporting information they need to be upheld by the courts." Irvin said his group was prepared to take the EPA to court over its latest rollback. "Clearly the administration is intent on rolling back as many protections as it can before January of 2021," he said. "Like any rushed efforts, they are likely to make mistakes that will be challenged and overturned in court." Supporters of the administration, however, are eager for the change. On a recent evening in Hugo, Minnesota, Fran Miron looked out over the 800-acre farm that his family has maintained for four generations and explained why he welcomes the Trump administration's latest rollback. He said the Obama rule led to widespread confusion, as well as worries about increasing costs and red tape. "In my opinion, and I think it's shared by many, this was really just a power grab," said Miron, 65, whose family milks 120 cows and grows corn, soybeans and alfalfa. A former mayor of Hugo, Miron said he believes that the federal government doesn't always know what's best for a particular place. "The best decisions are made locally because the local people understand the nature of the issues," he said. "They understand the nuances of the land and our water."

Illinois' coal-fired power plants must cut mercury emissions 90 percent by 2009, Toxic pollution in Connecticut and New England has dropped significantly over the last 10 years, according to new numbers released by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA on Tuesday said land, air and water pollution in New England fell by 50 percent between 2007 and 2017 — and by 57 percent in Connecticut. “Across the six New England states, the data show many positive trends for reductions in toxic chemical releases,” said Deb Szaro, EPA New England Acting Regional Administrator. While the overall reduction in pollution is impressive, town-by-town comparisons in Connecticut show toxins decreased in some communities and rose in others. Chemicals discharged into Bridgeport’s air decreased by 90 percent over the decade while air pollution in Danbury increased by 23 percent, for example. Szaro focused on the positive. “A robust economy and sound environmental policies can achieve measurable results for better public health protections,” Szaro said, adding environmental regulation and economic growth can work together.

Deregulation The period analyzed by EPA includes eight years of activist environmental regulation during former President Barack Obama’s tenure. Since the election of President Donald Trump two years ago, federal air and water regulations have been weakened, most notably in coal-producing regions. Asked if the proposed regulation rollbacks will affect the future discharge of pollution, EPA Spokesman John Senn said the agency expects to see continuing improvement. “We anticipate continuing to see positive performance with continued implementation of environmental regulations combined with the trends we’ve seen in 2017 of environmental stewardship practiced by companies across industrial sectors,” Senn said. A spokesman for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection declined comment on the EPA’s numbers. Privately, state sources said EPA’s release of the pollution data was a public relations ploy by a federal agency under fire for weakening environmental protections. Connecticut has sued the EPA over failure to enforce air pollution regulations on Midwestern factories, claiming that pollution drifts into the state on the prevailing wind. The state opposes Trump administration proposals to scale back auto emission standards and air and water regulations enacted by Obama. Varying success Town-by-town comparisons in Connecticut for toxins show the pollution numbers vary year to year, with some years higher than others. Senn said the numbers change from town to town because each community has different facilities that emit pollution. ”If there are only a few facilities, air pollution changes from one facility can have significant changes for an entire community,” Senn said. Since 2007, EPA said air pollution releases fell 57 percent at industrial facilities submitting data to the agency. Industrial facilities reported implementing nearly 4,000 new source reduction activities that eliminated or reduced chemical waste, EPA said. McMillan said projects which update wastewater plants or put scrubbers on smokestacks also create jobs. “To realize that cycle of improvement, though, we need to maintain strong environmental regulation,” McMillan said.

Illinois' coal-fired power plants must cut mercury emissions 90 percent by 2009, Toxic pollution in Connecticut and New England has dropped significantly over the last 10 years, according to new numbers released by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA on Tuesday said land, air and water pollution in New England fell by 50 percent between 2007 and 2017 — and by 57 percent in Connecticut. “Across the six New England states, the data show many positive trends for reductions in toxic chemical releases,” said Deb Szaro, EPA New England Acting Regional Administrator. While the overall reduction in pollution is impressive, town-by-town comparisons in Connecticut show toxins decreased in some communities and rose in others. Chemicals discharged into Bridgeport’s air decreased by 90 percent over the decade while air pollution in Danbury increased by 23 percent, for example. Szaro focused on the positive. “A robust economy and sound environmental policies can achieve measurable results for better public health protections,” Szaro said, adding environmental regulation and economic growth can work together. While economic growth and a clean environment can occur at the same time, the EPA is rolling back needed regulations, said Laura McMillan, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment. “The current federal administration has repeatedly rolled back environmental protections, loosened enforcement and threatened critical funding” McMillan said. “Weakening these safeguards could damage our natural resources in ways that would take many, many years and taxpayer dollars to recover from,” she said. Deregulation The period analyzed by EPA includes eight years of activist environmental regulation during former President Barack Obama’s tenure. Since the election of President Donald Trump two years ago, federal air and water regulations have been weakened, most notably in coal-producing regions. Asked if the proposed regulation rollbacks will affect the future discharge of pollution, EPA Spokesman John Senn said the agency expects to see continuing improvement. “We anticipate continuing to see positive performance with continued implementation of environmental regulations combined with the trends we’ve seen in 2017 of environmental stewardship practiced by companies across industrial sectors,” Senn said. A spokesman for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection declined comment on the EPA’s numbers. Privately, state sources said EPA’s release of the pollution data was a public relations ploy by a federal agency under fire for weakening environmental protections. Connecticut has sued the EPA over failure to enforce air pollution regulations on Midwestern factories, claiming that pollution drifts into the state on the prevailing wind. The state opposes Trump administration proposals to scale back auto emission standards and air and water regulations enacted by Obama. Varying success Town-by-town comparisons in Connecticut for toxins show the pollution numbers vary year to year, with some years higher than others. Senn said the numbers change from town to town because each community has different facilities that emit pollution. ”If there are only a few facilities, air pollution changes from one facility can have significant changes for an entire community,” Senn said. Since 2007, EPA said air pollution releases fell 57 percent at industrial facilities submitting data to the agency.

 Wesley Reynolds, For the Daily News Pictured are early electrical lines in Midland. (Photo provided/Wesley Reynolds) Pictured are early electrical lines in Midland. (Photo provided/Wesley Reynolds) Caption Close Pictured are early electrical lines in Midland. (Photo provided/Wesley Reynolds) Pictured are early electrical lines in Midland. (Photo provided/Wesley Reynolds) Who would have expected that one very important wedding in 1892 would lead to Midland city having its first electrical lighting contract long before most Midwestern cities were even thinking of electricity as a way of life? Soon after Herbert H. Dow moved to Midland in 1890, he met and asked to marry a local school teacher, Grace A. Ball. The date was set for Nov. 16, 1892. The Midland Sun announced the wedding with great pomp, focusing on the Ball family over Dow, as he was a relative newcomer and considered a "mad capped" inventor, whereas the Balls were one of Midland's finest families. Not to be outdone by the Sun’s coverage of the lavish wedding, its rival newspaper the Midland Republican — perhaps recognizing that Dow's wizardry might usher in a new, modern way of life – announced the wedding, but decided to run a story on Dow’s never-before-seen bromide process. Dow immediately seized on the opportunity to dazzle his spectators with a color, sound, and lights show. This was his chance, and he pulled back the curtain with all the flare of master magician. The Republican exclaimed: “When approaching the buildings one is struck with the brilliancy of the light that issues from windows and upon entering the whole building is found to be lighter by electricity.” This mechanical marvel included an engine room which housed the city’s most powerful steam engine with 200 horse power. A seven-ton drive wheel 14 feet across and a single large belt transferred what the Republican reporter called the “electrical excitement” of the power unit to the entire factory. The the heart of the factory transforming kinetic energy into electric energy was called a “dynamo.” For Midlanders, it was amazing to conceive of such a powerful force conveyed through small strands of copper wire, but the dynamo itself was large enough. It weighed about 12 tons and produced 50,000 volt amperes. An ashy lye pooled in vat upon vat of unrecognizable mixtures; boiling cauldrons of chemical alchemy. The plant ran 13 hours per day, was manned by only 12 men, and total $100,000 in capital. “Everything is of the finest make and therefore the most economical,” quipped the Republican. But the press wanted more. They clamored for electrical power for the whole city because they thought electricity should not be the power behind one industry alone, but rather should in some way become the energy of the people. It would signal a new era in the extension of human will over the environment, forever dispelling the darkness of past ages. “Midland then would be ‘in it,’” the reporter said. At the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893, an entire nation saw the promise of electric light. Nights at the fair were illuminated with Westinghouse’s electric light bulbs and generator. The “White City,” built to imitate the architectural glories of Rome, gleamed with the incandescent hew of a burning filament which would become the definition of synthetic light for over a century. Millions went to the Fair, and all those from Midland who could afford the trip headed southwest. The list included Midland’s finest citizens: storeowners Mr. and Mrs. William Reardon, Mrs. G. W. Abbey of Abbey’s Jewelry, Mr. Herb Sias from one of Midland’s oldest pioneer families, Mrs. Max Anderson, wife of the banker, and her daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Dow, the Hon. J. W. Cochrane and son, and Mr. D. P. Waldo's daughter. The Fair’s practical attractions appealed to both businessmen and housewives. Among the marvelous gardens, astounding machines, climbing towers, and glistening fountains, Midlanders glimpsed their future as Americans. Dow hurried back from the Fair and installed yet another dynamo in his factory. In February 1894, Alderman Gordon appointed a committee to investigate the potential of lighting Main Street. The City Council saw to all the preparations and the date was set for May. Operations commenced in March. One workman even boasted that they could finish by the middle of April, but that was overstating the case. Dynamos sat out in the open until a power house could be constructed. Poles and wires were set up without either destinations or sources of power. Who would be first to be lit up? Bradley’s furniture factory on Ashman Street hosted the new electric works. From there, three wires were hung above Main Street and more than eight miles of wire were bought by the highest bidder. And wire was not cheap. It cost $100 per mile which amounts to $2,941.18 today! Many Midland businesses continued to favor gas for a few more years. Then the illuminations began. After adjusting the “arc light” fixtures, the workmen finally unveiled the light. Dozens of little blazing stars appeared over the street, rolling back the darkness. Then someone thought up a fun way of celebrating. The townsfolk hung Chinese lanterns to throw the marvelous incandescent yellow into a thousand shades of color. It was as if something Jules Verne had imagined had come to Midland, and the magic lights were far more glorious than anyone had imagined. The pioneering era had been extinguished with the lighting of modern life. All were not satisfied, however, as light pollution became a sudden reality. Many questioned the morality of a city with its own nightlife. Others worried that electric light would increase the pace of life in general. The city had forever cast the cold, desolate darkness of Michigan’s endless stump-country behind her. “Insomnia is fearfully on the increase,” ran an advertisement in the Republican. “The rush and excitement of modern life so tax the nervous system that multitudes of people are deprived of good and sufficient sleep, with ruinous consequences to the nerves.” Was man doomed now to a stream of constant urban activity? Would he never again return to the Paradise of “still waters” which “restore the soul?” Time would tell. Wesley Reynolds is a volunteer with the Midland County Historical Society.

 Dan Freedman Caption Close Washington Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Wednesday will introduce legislation to force the Environmental Protection Agency to set maximum levels for the class of chemicals involved in drinking-water contamination in Hoosick Falls and other sites in New York. The measure would require the EPA to set maximum levels for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS for short. The EPA would have two years to do it. In February, the EPA issued what its top official termed an "all-encompassing plan" on PFAS but sidestepped setting maximum levels. The agency, which under President Donald Trump has been in the forefront of rolling back pollution regulations, promised to look into setting new levels. Currently there is no maximum established for PFAS, but the EPA has established a health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) in drinking water. Gillibrand's bill, co-authored with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., reflects the skepticism of health and environmental advocates who say they doubt the EPA will buck the chemical industry's lobbyists. "It is the EPA's job to protect Americans from highly toxic chemicals like PFAS, but they have failed to do what is necessary to help ensure our families in New York and across the country are no longer exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS in their drinking water," Gillibrand said in a statement. "This is a widespread crisis that is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk." Gillibrand has been alternating periods of legislative activity on Capitol Hill with appearances on the campaign trail in her bid to become the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. Toxic levels of a variety of PFAS were found in the drinking water in Hoosick Falls in 2014, the result of filtration from a nearby plant producing chemicals for nonstick plastics in cookware and other products. The levels discovered in Hoosick Falls in 2014 ranged from 180 ppt to 540 ppt. Health and environmental experts and advocates say the advisory level of 70 ppt is too high. In December, the New York Drinking Water Quality Council recommended a "maximum contaminant level" of 10 parts per billion for the two PFAS chemicals found in water in Hoosick Falls, Petersburgh, Newburgh and elsewhere in the state. They are PFOA — perfluorooctanoic acid — and PFOS — perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. But the recommendation has not officially been adopted by the state Department of Health. If it were in force, it would be the most stringent state standard in the nation. The chemical industry has gradually withdrawn PFAS from the market, putting in place substitutes like GenX. But advocates have pointed to studies casting doubt on industry claims that GenX and other chemicals like it are much of an improvement. The industry generally has been supportive of efforts to fight contamination, including specific ceilings for PFAS. But they warn against what they see as overkill. "The weight of scientific evidence does not support some of the proposed policies that are currently under consideration," said John Banovetz, a senior vice president at 3M Corp. "In fact, no public health agency in the world has found that PFAS cause harm to human health at past or current exposure levels." He added: "Legislatively dictated, predetermined outcomes that don't follow the science would undermine the integrity of the regulatory process going forward." The discovery of toxins in drinking water turned Hoosick Falls into a ground zero of sorts for chemical pollution in water. PFAS do not dissipate once they infiltrate ground water. Studies have linked the chemicals to kidney, breast and testicular cancer. The EPA designated parts of the village as Superfund cleanup sites, and its drinking water is now filtered by equipment supplied by the plastics manufacturer blamed for causing the pollution, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, a multinational corporation based in France. The village of Hoosick Falls has been involved in legal action against Saint-Gobain and Honeywell International, another operator of a factory in the area. Gillibrand and Capito are both members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which will hold a legislative hearing on chemical pollution next Wednesday. In addition, the House Energy & Commerce subcommittee on environment and climate change, chaired by Rep. Paul Tonko, D-Amsterdam, will hold a hearing Wednesday on 13 House bills also aimed at reining in PFAS pollution. Among them is one authored by freshman Rep. Antonio Delgado, D-Rhinebeck, which would require EPA public reporting of PFAS releases. Among the witnesses testifying will be Emily Marpe, a mother and community member from Petersburgh.

 By Brian Nearing Caption Close Watervliet A military contractor at the Watervliet Arsenal is paying a $50,000 fine for failing to properly maintain air pollution control equipment, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Hartchrom Inc., a chrome plating company that lines cannon tubes for the U.S. Army, also agreed to improve its inspection and record-keeping for equipment used to control pollution from its chroming process. During two visits to the Building 35 facility in early August 2018, state inspectors found that Hartchrom workers were failing to inspect the pollution control equipment for cracks or leaks. The inspectors then discovered cracks in equipment meant to remove chromium, a toxic, carcinogenic heavy metal. If Hartchrom fixes the issues, DEC agreed to suspend an additional $10,000 fine, according to an agreement signed by DEC and Hartchrom last month. Calls to Hartchrom for comment Tuesday weren't returned. Calls to Michael Sterthous, an Albany-based lawyer for Hartchrom, which has been at the arsenal since 2002, for comment also weren't returned. In March 2017, the Swiss-based company was awarded a $17 million contract from the U.S. Army to perform chrome-plating and surfacing operations for cannon barrels on 120 millimeter and 155 millimeter cannon. According to a DEC statement, the agency has "no evidence of Hartchrom violating emission standards." When pollution equipment was tested by state inspectors in October 2015, it was found to be operating within acceptable limits, according to DEC. When the cracks were found in August 2018, the equipment was again found to be working properly. DEC indicated that Hartchrom was last cited by DEC in 2010 for violations that included beginning construction without a permit. In 2014, the company got into a dispute with arsenal managers over the company's attempted improper disposal of tainted production liquid at the facility's wastewater treatment plant. Arsenal officials stopped the company from dumping 39,000 gallons of tainted liquid, forcing Hartchrom to dispose of the liquid as hazardous waste. Afterward, Hartchrom tried to recoup what it claimed were more than $92,000 in disposal and lost revenue expenses from the U.S. Army. But last year, the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals denied the claim. Calls to arsenal officials for comment weren't returned. Last year, the Army took back management control of the arsenal from the not-for-profit Arsenal Business & Technology Partnership, which had brought in Hartchrom as a tenant.

That’s according to the American Lung Association “State of the Air 2019” report released Wednesday, April 24, 2019 that ranks metropolitan areas based on ozone and particle pollution during 2015, 2016 and 2017. When it comes to clean air, all eight Connecticut counties get an F with ozone pollution. That’s according to the American Lung Association “State of the Air 2019” report released Wednesday, April 24, When it comes to clean air, all eight Connecticut counties get an F for ozone pollution. In a report released Wednesday by the American Lung Association — “State of the Air 2019” — researchers ranked metropolitan areas based on ozone and particle pollution in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The 20th annual air quality report card tracks Americans’ exposure to unhealthful levels of ozone and particle pollution, both of which can be deadly. Connecticut’s worst air pollution ranking comes from ozone. The state is ranked 10th as the worst polluted with ozone. The ranking includes New York-Newark, N.J. and Pennsylvania. Often called smog, ozone pollution is harmful to breathe. Ozone aggressively attacks lung tissue by reacting chemically with it. When ozone is present, other harmful pollutants can be created. The methodology of the report determined a “weighted average” of ozone pollution based on the number of “orange” and “red” days. Orange days are when the air quality index is between 101 and 150, on days when temperatures are in the 80s and 90s and winds are light. Red days are when air quality index is between 151 and 200, on days that are hot, hazy and humid, the air is stagnant and skies are sunny with little chance of precipitation. Fairfield County had the highest number of high ozone days with an average of 25.8 days. It had 52 orange days and 17 red days. New Haven County was second with 15.7 days. It had 32 orange days and 10 red days. Middlesex County was third with 11.5 days. It had 30 orange days and three red days. New London County had an average of 10.7 days. It had 26 orange days and 4 red days. Hartford County was fifth with 6.2 days. It had 17 orange days and one red day. Litchfield County has a weighted average of 6.2 days. It had 13 orange days and one red day. Tolland County average was 4.7 days. It had 14 orange days and no red days. Windham County had the lowest average with 3.8 days. It had 10 orange days and no red days. California had the highest ozone pollution with seven of its cities in the Top 10. Connecticut gets a passing grade with particle pollution — a mix of ash, soot, diesel exhaust, chemicals, metals and aerosols. The microscopic particles can burrow deep within the lungs, triggering asthma, heart attacks, strokes and lung cancer. Although Connecticut has some of the toughest air pollution standards in the country, officials have said Connecticut is downwind of polluting power plants in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia that have failed to provide ozone-reduction plans. Connecticut joined New York and six other Northeastern states in suing the EPA over the enforcement of pollution from Midwestern power plants. The Trump administration has allowed nine states to exceed pollution limits. In February, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong filed the suit to force the Environmental Protection Agency to comply with federal law by requiring further controls on smog pollution. “Connecticut sits at the end of the tailpipe of the nation's exhaust fumes, with severe consequences for public health,” Tong said. “States like Connecticut ... downwind of some of our country's heaviest polluters need the protection of strong interstate ozone pollution regulation. Trump EPA’s failure to comply with the Clean Air Act violates federal law and endangers the health of Connecticut families.”

 By Brian Nearing Schenectady Toxic chemicals will be dug out of two vacant former dry cleaners sites in Schenectady and Watervliet, under plans announced by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The property around the former Admiral Cleaners, 617 19th St., Watervliet, and the former Kenwood Cleaners, 445 Duane Ave., Schenectady, are tainted with high levels of a carcinogenic dry cleaning solvent, tetrachloroethene (PCE), and related toxic byproducts. Exposure to PCE likely increases cancer risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Primary effects from chronic, long-term inhalation exposure are neurological, including impaired cognitive and motor neurobehavioral performance, according to EPA. PCE exposure may also "cause adverse effects in the kidney, liver, immune system and hematologic system, and on development and reproduction," according to the EPA. DEC plans to dig up and dispose of about 15 feet of PCE-tainted soil around the Admiral site and remove an underground storage tank, according to agency paperwork. The site closed in 2017, but had been a dry cleaners since 1950 before closing in 2013 due to environmental violations. After that, it was used as a drop-off shop for dry cleaning, where clothes were taken elsewhere to be cleaned. The $400,000 cost of the program would be paid for the by the state Superfund program, which covers the expense of cleanups when the person or company responsible for the pollution cannot pay or refuses to do so. A copy of the plan can be found in the office of the Watervliet city clerk at 2 Fifteenth St., Watervliet. At the former Kenwood site, about 20 feet of PCE-tainted soil will be removed and disposed of as part of a $1.1 million cleanup plan, according to DEC paperwork. It also will be paid for through the state Superfund program. The cleaners opened in 1950, and operated as late as the 1980s, according to DEC. PCE was found in both the ground and groundwater at levels well beyond state safety standards. PCE vapors were also found to be leaking out of the ground, including at one unspecified "off-site" location. A copy of the plan can be found at the Phyllis Bornt Branch Library, 948 State St., Schenectady.

 Seth Borenstein Associated Press Washington After several years of little growth, global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide experienced their largest jump in seven years, discouraging scientists. World carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to have risen 2.7 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to three studies released Wednesday from the Global Carbon Project, an international scientific collaboration of academics, governments and industry that tracks greenhouse gas emissions. The calculations, announced during negotiations to put the 2015 Paris climate accord into effect, puts some of the landmark agreement's goals nearly out of reach, scientists said. "This is terrible news," said Andrew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive, which models greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures but was not part of the research. "Every year that we delay serious climate action, the Paris goals become more difficult to meet." The studies concluded that this year the world would spew 40.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion tons last year. The margin of error is about one percentage point on either side. The Global Carbon Project uses government and industry reports to come up with final emission figures for 2017 and projections for 2018 based on the four biggest polluters: China, the United States, India and the European Union. The U.S., which had been steadily decreasing its carbon pollution, showed a significant rise in emissions — up 2.5 percent — for the first time since 2013. China, the globe's biggest carbon emitter, saw its largest increase since 2011: 4.6 percent. Study lead author Corinne Le Quere, a climate change researcher at the University of East Anglia in England, said she believes unusual factors are at play this year. For the U.S., it was a combination of a hot summer and cold winter that required more electricity use for heating and cooling. For China, it was an economic stimulus that pushed coal-powered manufacturing, Le Quere said. Use of coal — the biggest carbon emitter — is rising.

 By Chris Tomlinson, Staff writer Caption Close Not long ago, I questioned the conservatism of those who think personal liberty is best measured by access to thin-film plastic bags and single-use plastic straws. Today, I question the wisdom of condemning a whole class of materials. Environmental groups love publishing images of marine mammals suffering from plastic waste. We’ve all seen the plastic clogging at least one whale’s intestines. Researchers, meanwhile, have published reams of data showing how plastic-coating the planet will ruin our health. Since 1950, the world has dumped 14.3 trillion pounds of plastic waste on the planet, including landfills and oceans. The industry produces another 350 billion tons of resins and fibers every year, with industry estimates predicting the market will grow to 535 billion tons a year by 2035. On HoustonChronicle.com: Plastics industry promises to fight waste; trust but verify More than half of all plastic by weight is used only once before going to a landfill or the ocean, according to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal Science Advances. People will incinerate 8 percent of it, and 30 percent of plastic is for long-term use. Only 7 percent is recycled, but only once, before it goes to a landfill. Whether a plastic water bottle ends up littering the planet or in a landfill, though, depends strictly on where it’s consumed. Most marine plastic waste comes from Asia, and overwhelmingly from China, India and Thailand. More than 86 percent of the plastic found in the ocean was dumped first in either an Asian or African river and flowed to the sea. “We all know that plastics should never end up as garbage, particularly not ending up in the ocean,” Patty Long, interim CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, told the Global Plastics Summit, organized by research and data firm IHS Markit. “It’s been pretty uncomfortable over the last six months to a year as we’ve watched images of plastics streaming over beaches, and pictures of sea animals who have ingested plastics,” she added. “There are people looking for quick fixes and easy solutions, but if you’ve spent any amount of time working in this industry, you know there are no silver bullets.” Plastics play an essential role in solving our other global problem: climate change. Plastics make things lighter, which means they require less energy. Plastics can seal buildings and coat windows to provide insulation and save on climate control. Some plastic items should be banned, but most improve our lives. They need to be recycled. Public support for recycling is so strong that half of consumers said they would pay more for sustainable products designed to be reused or recycled, according to a survey from Accenture, the consulting firm. But 72 percent of the respondents from 11 countries perceived plastic as the least environmentally friendly type of packaging, presenting a severe challenge to the industry. Current plastics recycling programs are a financial and literal mess, producing unaffordable products or food-contaminated waste. Ever since China banned the importation of U.S. plastic waste, it has lost all monetary value. The plastics industry needs a system like the one for aluminum, which is efficient and makes collecting cans financially worthwhile. Most recycled plastic currently is mulched and has limited applications. What the industry needs is a chemical system that turns plastic back into a resin that can be used as feedstock for making more plastic products. Unfortunately, chemical recycling systems are mostly experimental, said Dewey Johnson, vice president for base chemicals and plastics at IHS Markit. “To go from where we are today, to have large commercial scale operations that have a global impact, is probably about a decade away,” Johnson predicted. On HoustonChronicle.com: The future may not be plastics after all The Plastics Industry Association is asking Congress to kick start the process by passing the RECOVER Act. The proposal would give federal grants to help develop advanced plastic recycling facilities. “Congress is starting to recognize that while this is really difficult right now in the short term, it does have some opportunities in terms of jobs, investment, wages and taxes,” Long said. If U.S. companies can make recycling plastic profitable, they can take that technology to Asia and pay people to stop throwing reusable resources in their rivers. Rewarding good behavior is always better than trying to punish bad. The root cause of plastic pollution is not what most people imagine. The solution is more complicated than they would prefer, and simple slogans will take us down the wrong path. Cleaning up the plastic pollution smothering the planet requires industry, consumers and government to compromise - not vilify one another.

Overall, the authority’s budget for 2019-2020 is planned for $18.6 million, with just under $16.5 million coming from Norwalk customers. “The Norwalk Water Pollution Control Authority, an enterprise fund, manages the City’s sanitary sewer collection system, pumping stations and wastewater treatment facility, in accordance with environmental standards and regulations in the most cost-effective and responsible manner,” Ralph Kolb, the senior environmental engineer wrote to the Board of Estimate and Taxation in a March letter. Kolb appeared before the Board in April so it could approve the upcoming year’s budget. Some of the drivers of the increased revenue include the fact that that authority’s 20-year wastewater treatment service agreement with OMI, Inc, will expire in May 2020. “In November 2018, we issued a request for proposals and the deadline for submission was March 15, 2019 in which we received 4 proposals,” Kolb told the board. “We’re currently engaged in the evaluation and interview process.” One of the bidders was OMI again, he said, but they have more work to do before selecting their next service provider. However, no matter who the contractor is, Kolb said he believes the price will go up. “We’re anticipating an increase in the annual fee,” he said. This year, the authority also has to purchase nitrogen credits for $90,000 instead of getting those back as additional revenue, Kolb said. The state launched the credit program in 2002 to reduce nitrogen discharged in Long Island Sound, but the wet 2018 caused them to have more than usual, Kolb said. Despite the exceptionally wet year, Kolb said they are not close to the capacity of the wastewater treatment facility, which can handle up to 18 million gallons a day. On average, the city produces 13-14 million gallons each day. The Board of Estimate and Taxation unanimously approved the authority’s proposed budget at its April meeting. kelly.kultys@hearstmediact.com

 By Kaitlin Bain Caption Close A coalition of residents is organizing to tell the state to stop allowing industrial plants to leach pollution into Southeast Texas. Several residents have raised concerns specifically about the levels of sulfur dioxide being released by Oxbow Calcining in Port Arthur. They’re also asking the state to step up lead monitoring in Southeast Texas. The group is planning to submit comments to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality during the annual comment period for input on the agency’s air quality monitoring techniques. The document that details the techniques provides information on the Texas network of ambient air quality monitors that were established to meet national ambient air quality standards, according to the agency. The agency is required to make the report available for public comment before it’s sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “TCEQ works for the public. These organizations exist to provide services to the people and work at our behest,” local activist and former U.S. Rep. Nick Lampson said. “If the citizens aren’t paying attention, then we deserve what we get. But when we participate and speak out, then I think these agencies have an obligation to fix the problem.” Lampson said he’s concerned about Oxbow because he believes the company has been allowed to circumvent the pollution-monitoring process. Oxbow’s Port Arthur calcining plant, on a 112-acre waterfront site near the Sabine Neches Ship Channel, uses petroleum coke, a byproduct from the oil refining process, to create calcined coke, which is then sold to make aluminum, titanium dioxide and other industrial products. The Beaumont Enterprise reported in April that a TCEQ ambient air quality monitor, the location of which was chosen based on Oxbow’s operations, has not been proven to be adequately monitoring sulfur dioxide emissions from the plant. >> Related: Emissions concerns arise over Port Arthur plant To participate in the comment period: The proposed 2019 plan can be viewed on the TCEQ’s website by visiting tceq.texas.gov, clicking air, air quality and monitoring and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 2019 Annual Monitoring Network Plan under the heading “Studies and Data.” Mail comments to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, P.O. Box 13087, Attention: Holly Landuyt, MC-165, Austin, Texas 78711-3087 Email comments to monops@tceq.texas.gov The comment period ends May 22. That’s because, after the monitor’s location was chosen, the plant began releasing all emissions at a much higher temperature than original testing took into account. Neil Carman, a former TCEQ investigator who is now the director of the Clean Air Program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter, said with the additional heat, the emissions likely are going up and over the monitor and ending up concentrated in a different part of Port Arthur than original testing revealed. Oxbow spokesman Brad Goldstein in April said the company is in full compliance with its operating permits. “We are proud of our environmental record and continue to work proactively with TCEQ to operate within all applicable laws and permits,” he said in an email. But Port Arthur environmental activist Hilton Kelley said while the company may appear to be in compliance, TCEQ should take a more active role in investigating the issue. “That Seventh Street monitor isn’t doing a whole lot of good because it appears that a lot of the emissions coming from Oxbow aren’t hitting the monitor,” he said. “We have a large number of people with respiratory problems, asthma. I do believe it’s because of the disproportionate amount of sulfur from places like Oxbow,” he added. Kelley said he’s also concerned about the amount of lead coming from Oxbow and other plants, information he plans to include in his comments. TCEQ does not have any monitors in the Beaumont-Port Arthur area to pick up lead concentrations on its Ambient Air Monitoring Network Site List. Lampson, Kelley and others are urging residents to join them in sending comments to TCEQ. “I’m hoping people will understand this is adverse to them and say something,” Lampson said. “Go out and change our community so our future gets better.” The two men acknowledged that not everyone has the time or knowledge to gather extensive data about issues in the area. But that doesn’t have to stop residents from making comments, Kelley said. Lampson said residents can write a note saying they agree with other comments being made on an issue. Kelley suggested making comments personal, which sometimes can do more than straight numbers. “We already know Port Arthur is a hotbed for cancer. We know there’s a large amount of toxins being dumped in the air,” Kelley said. “They can talk about the impact of the emissions on family and friends. They can talk about the smell in the air. They can talk about how they feel inside their homes. They can talk about the number of times they’ve had to stay inside for a chemical release without knowing what’s going on. All these things point to the issues we’re having without needing data.” kaitlin.bain@beaumontenterprise.com twitter.com/KaitlinBain Kaitlin Bain is the Government Reporter for the Beaumont Enterprise.

 MNA Staff Caption Close From the Lansing State Journal LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Scientists want to use an unconventional method to remove pollution at former General Motors properties near Lansing where an underground plume of chemicals is creeping toward drinking water wells. The Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust controls the former GM plants. It is proposing a remediation method called "biosparging," which removes pollution by injecting air into groundwater. The method encourages bacteria to consume 1,4-dioxane, an industrial chemical that GM used to clean oil off car parts. Should the trust gain state approval, the project would be among the first and likely the largest to use the method, the Lansing State Journal reported . It's unclear how much the project would cost, but engineers said it could take six to 12 years to fully clean the water. The pollution was discovered after the trust was established by the federal government to take over the GM sites following the company's bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. The dioxane plume is located under two former GM plants in Lansing Township and Lansing. Dave Favero, deputy cleanup manager for the Michigan properties, said dioxane is very soluble. If dioxane is in oil, as it was used at the GM plants, "it leaches out and starts to migrate with the groundwater," he said. Long-term exposure could lead to liver, kidney and reproductive problems and possibly cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Lansing-area plume is within the Lansing Board of Water and Light's wellhead protection area for some of its drinking water wells. Up to 10 of the utility's wells are downstream from the polluted groundwater. The utility started monitoring for dioxane in 2015, and found a small amount within the limits of what the EPA considers safe. The utility hasn't monitored dioxane levels that exceed the EPA's safe limit yet. The trust will need to get approval from state environmental regulators. Scientists and engineers could begin installing biosparging wells this year if the plan is approved.

 By Brian Nearing Troy Petroleum giant Chevron could pay about $1.8 million to clean up a former industrial site in South Troy once used to make manufactured coal gas and later to store asphalt, according to a plan being considered by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Work at the 7-acre Water Street property, located just south of the Route 378 (Menands) bridge, should start next year and last about nine months, according to a DEC notice this week. Storage tanks on the site were removed in 2006 and the site is currently vacant. California-based Chevron USA Inc. would pay to remove about 725 cubic yards of soil contaminated with nearly a dozen industrial chemicals, tar and asphalt left behind when the site closed in 1999 after at least seven decades of industrial use, first for plants that manufactured coal coke and gas, and then for asphalt storage and distribution. The ground is now polluted with aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzopyrene, benzoanthracene, benzene, toluene, arsenic and xylene. Tests have found coal tar as far as 11 feet underground. Once the contaminated soil is removed, the cleanup plan calls for the site to be covered with soil "acceptable for commercial and industrial land use," according to DEC. The land has been filled in with "slag, cinders, brick, gravel and other materials" over the past, according to DEC. DEC will hold a public hearing on the proposal at 7 p.m. Feb. 20 at Troy City Hall, 433 River St., and is taking public comments on the plan Feb. 1 through March 2, through John Spellman, project manager, NYSDEC, Division of Environmental Remediation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233, or john.spellman@dec.ny.gov. A copy of the proposal is available for public inspection at the Troy Public Library, 100 Second St., Troy.

 Kyunghee Park, Bloomberg Caption Close The world's biggest shipbuilder sees China's cleanup of its smoggy skies lifting prices of the vessels this year. As China prioritizes dealing with the smog that has famously blanketed Beijing and other big cities, the world's second-biggest economy is increasingly turning to liquefied natural gas as a replacement for coal for heating and other purposes, boosting imports of the cleaner fuel. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. expects orders for carriers of the gas to lead demand for new ships, Chief Executive Officer Sam H. Ka said. "China's need for LNG appears to have triggered the restart of some gas projects in the U.S., Australia and Qatar," Ka said in a phone interview from Seoul. "Our slots for LNG-carrier construction are pretty much filled up until 2021." Surging demand for LNG in China, as well as in smaller emerging economies, has spurred energy explorers including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA to focus on investments in gas development projects. The accompanying demand for carriers to transport the fuel is a bright spot for a shipbuilding industry that has struggled to win orders since crude oil prices slumped in 2014. Qatar plans to order about 60 new LNG carriers, adding to the 50 it already owns, according to Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al Kaabi. Shares of Hyundai Heavy rose 0.7 percent in Seoul to 143,500 won Tuesday, the highest closing price since March 28. That compares with a 0.3 percent gain in South Korea's benchmark Kospi index. Hyundai's rivals Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. and Samsung Heavy Industries Co. also advanced. Ka expects the rising demand to benefit the world's top three shipyards, which are all based in South Korea. Gas carriers are the most expensive commercial ships and take the longest time to build. "This is a good start to the new year with clear signs of strong demand for LNG carriers," said Um Kyung-a, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul. "As more and more slots get filled with LNG-carrier orders, it's going to enable shipyards to raise prices for all types of vessels." Hyundai Heavy, Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., together with other smaller South Korean shipyards, won 94 percent of the 80 LNG carriers ordered worldwide last year, according to the country's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. The companies also accounted for 87 percent of Very Large Crude Carriers ordered globally. These helped increase their order backlog by 25 percent last year and will allow them to raise prices for vessels, Ka said on Jan. 24. The executive predicted that average prices for ships built by Hyundai Heavy and its rivals could climb 10 percent this year following a 10 percent increase in 2018. Samsung Heavy received an order from Celsius Tankers in Europe to build two 180,000-cubic-meter LNG carriers for about $375 million, the Seongnam-based shipbuilder said in an email Tuesday. The latest orders planned by Qatar, announced Monday at a Qatar-South Korea summit, comes more than a decade after the Middle Eastern nation's last major LNG-carrier contracts for Korean shipyards. In the three years through 2007, the world's three biggest shipbuilders won orders from Qatar to build more than 40 LNG carriers. Ka expects the global shipbuilding industry to continue on a gradual recovery over the next few years. Orders could exceed 60 million gross tons, which measures the volume of space in a ship, rising from a little more than 55 million tons estimated for last year. Hyundai Heavy could report better earnings for 2019, helped by prices of steel plates that are expected to stagnate or rise moderately this year, Ka said. Prices of the material, used to make the hull of ships, rose more than 30 percent last year, contributing to a nine-month net loss of 274.8 billion won at the company, which is scheduled to report full-year results this week.

 By Marissa Luck Caption Close Exxon Mobil, under pressure from shareholders, has agreed to report plastic pellet spills from its polymer production plants to prevent ocean pollution, according to a shareholder group that focuses on corporate responsibility. The shareholder group, As You Sow, filed a proposed shareholder resolution in January with several major petrochemical producers, including Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical, Phillips 66 and Chevron, asking for annual reporting on spills and measures taken to prevent and clean up spills. Exxon appears to be the first company to succumb to the pressure. Under a deal struck with As You Sow, Exxon will begin providing details about whether any spills occurred, specifics about how it is monitoring for spills and how it is managing pellets. It will also describe how the company assesses the effectiveness of pellet loss prevention measures. The company apparently did not have any spills though in 2018, according to As You Sow. As a result of the agreement, As You Sow withdrew its shareholder proposal, according to SEC documents. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond what was said in the SEC documents acknowledging the withdrawal of the shareholder proposal. RELATED: Reporter’s Notebook: Can chemistry fix the plastic waste problem? "We are pleased that Exxon Mobil has agreed to do public reporting on plastic pellet spills and management," said Conrad MacKerron, senior vice president at As You Sow in a statement. "It is important for all industry players to establish similar transparency so stakeholders can get a realistic view of the size and scope of this problem. We hope the other companies we are engaged with will follow its lead. 260 species affected Exxon's petrochemical division has several plants that produce plastic pellets, called nurdles, which are used to produce thousands of everyday plastic products. These tiny plastic pellets, which can be spilled during handling and transportation and swept into waterways, are estimated to be the second largest direct source of microplastic pollution to the ocean by weight. The tiny pellets, the size of fish eggs, make their way onto shorelines, beaches and break up into smaller pieces that animals can mistake as food. Plastic pollution affects 260 species, causing fatalities from ingestion, entanglement, suffocation and drowning, according to As You Sow. Exxon Mobil is the first major petrochemical producer to agree to report information on plastic pellet spills publicly to shareholders, said Jane Patton, coordinator based in New Orleans with the anti-plastic pollution advocacy movement Break Free From Plastic. "This is significant and huge," Patton said. "I'm glad they're willing to disclose this, but there is a lot more that Exxon needs to be doing to mitigate harm to local communities" that comes as a result of air and waste pollution from petrochemical plants." Many petrochemical companies are involved in a program called Operation Clean Sweep that aims to promote best practices for pellet management and containment to prevent pellet spills.But As You Sow has criticized the group because it doesn't require companies to publicly report spills or plastic management methods. TEAMING UP: LyondellBasell, Dow chiefs call on industry to fix plastic waste problem The other shareholder proposals filed with Chevron, Phillips 66 and Dow Chemical will likely be voted on during shareholder meetings this spring. Taking responsibility As You Sow last year was involved in successful efforts to push Starbucks to ditch plastic straws and pressure KraftHeinz, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and others to commit to increase the use of recycled packaging in their products. Chuck Venezia, senior vice president of petrochemicals at the analyst and research firm Argus Media, said petrochemical companies typically have redundant systems to prevent spills because it's in their best economic interest to avoid losing the product. The issue of plastic pellet spills has not been a major focus area yet for the industry, but he noted that the industry is starting to take more responsibility for reducing plastic waste through better waste management systems, community education and recycling initiatives. "There are so many benefits to plastics that are not getting reported – but just like everything else they need to be handled and treated properly," Venezia said. Ashish Chitalia, polyolefin analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the industry is responding broader backlash against single-use plastics with initiatives such as the nonprofit the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. "We expect to see broader participation in reporting the plastic pellet losses, as doing so may enable companies to improve their economics, standard handling procedure and their sustainability goals," Chitalia said.

 Stephen J. Bronner Caption Close Pizza was just the first step to saving the world, according to Zume co-founder and CEO Alex Garden. The company, makers of a robot-powered truck that cooks pizzas en route to customers, today announced it is making a major pivot to manufacturing compostable food containers. The world, particularly the oceans, are choking on plastic. Ocean Conservancy estimates that every year "8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments." In a stretch of the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and California, there's a mass of plastic and other trash that's about three times the size of Texas. Some of this plastic will take hundreds of years to break down. Much of this pollution -- 300 million tons globally a year -- comes from our addiction to single use plastics, such as bags, tableware and takeout containers. To get a grasp of this worsening problem, you need not look further than China. A recent New York Times story illustrated that just through food delivery apps, the large country generated 1.6 million tons of waste in 2017 -- including "1.2 million tons of plastic containers, 175,000 tons of disposable chopsticks, 164,000 tons of plastic bags and 44,000 tons of plastic spoons" -- a ninefold increase from 2015. Related: Why This Company That Relies on Automation Talks Openly About the Future of Work The answer isn't recycling; only 9 percent of all plastic waste ever produced has been recycled, according to the U.N. The only solution now is to not make the plastic problem worse. That's what Zume hopes to do. The four-year-old company has acquired Pivot Packaging, which co-created Zume's signature compostable Pizza Pod. The combined company, now called Zume Packaging, opened a 70,000 square foot manufacturing plant in southern California. There, it will use a proprietary process to turn materials such as bagasse (sugarcane fiber), bamboo, wheat, straw, and other organic fibers (some of which were bound for landfills) into cups, bowls, plates, utensils and serving trays. Garden said these items break down in 90 days. Two more plants, another in the U.S. and one overseas, are planned as well. The company has set an ambitious goal of replacing 1 billion plastic and styrofoam food containers by 2020. Its customers, which the company says it can't divulge, include a large airline, a $5 billion U.S. foodservice brand and a food conglomerate. "What Zume Pizza really was and still is today is a testing ground for this incredible suite of technologies, which we're beginning to announce today," Garden told Entrepreneur. "Zume is the first attempt to reboot the [packaging] supply chain and to give companies big and small around the world technologies that radically improve their sustainability and improve their margins at the same time. There's no limit to what this technology can create. There's some material science limits, but expect everything that's currently food related, single use plastic to be in scope for us." Related: How Food Entrepreneurs Are Saving the Planet, According to the CEO of Tofurky The cost equation is vital to making any progress with the fight against plastic. After all, businesses only use them because they're so cheap. Garden said Zume's compostable solutions will be at or below the cost of competing products. "When we first started making [the Pizza Pod], it was about $2 a package, which is ridiculous," he said. "We were able to engineer it down to 68 cents a package, which is better, but still far too expensive. As we went further down the road on packaging, we realized there was a huge opportunity. That's why we bought Pivot. We don't want restaurants to have to make tough compromises between profitability and sustainability." He pointed out that Zume also has an advantage as more countries, including most recently Canada, ban single use plastics. The move into packaging is only part of the business expansion for Zume, which holds more than 1,700 patents. Pizza will now fall under Zume Culinary, which will create solutions for food delivery services. Zume Forward will aim to help food companies "predict demand and deploy food and goods where people want them," according to the company. Finally, Zume Source will offer alternatives "for how food is grown, transported, prepared and packaged." Related: Hemp Could Be the Solution to Our Plastic Pollution Crisis But Garden, who previously served as the former president of Zynga and general manager of Xbox Live, said pizza serves as the foundation for his company. "It's pretty disingenuous to try to sell technology into the food industry if you're not a food company," he said. "So we knew that we had to earn the right to have a point of view, and there's no better way to do that than to serve customers safely with craveable food and really demonstrate that you understand what goes into that service."

Firefighters arrive at the site where the Intercontinental Terminals Company petrochemical fire reignited as crews tried to clean out the chemicals that remained in the tanks Friday, March 22, 2019, in Deer Caption Close Firefighters arrive at the site where the Intercontinental Terminals Company petrochemical fire reignited as crews tried to clean out the chemicals that remained in the tanks Friday, March 22, 2019, in Deer Park, Texas. Firefighters arrive at the site where the Intercontinental Terminals Company petrochemical fire reignited as crews tried to clean out the chemicals that remained in the tanks Friday, March 22, 2019, in Deer AUSTIN — Attorney General Ken Paxton, on behalf of the state’s top regulatory agency, filed suit Friday against the company responsible for the Deer Park fire, alleging it released pollution in violation of the Texas Clean Air Act. In the 18-page suit filed in a Travis County district court, Paxton seeks a citation and civil penalties against Intercontinental Terminals Company, the liquid storage terminal company whose facility caused a series of fires this week, for violations of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality rules. The violations include unauthorized air pollution, outdoor burning and visible emissions. Paxton also seeks an injunction to force the company to comply with the law. “The state of Texas works hard to maintain good air quality and will hold ITC accountable for the damage it has done to our environment,” Paxton said in a statement. “ITC has a history of environmental violations, and this latest incident is especially disturbing and frightening. No company can be allowed to disrupt lives and put public health and safety at risk.” For subscribers: Latest fire contained at charred Deer Park plant The TCEQ continues to monitor the air quality in the affected areas about 20 miles east of Houston. The federal Chemical Safety Board, which investigates serious chemical accidents, announced Thursday that it is opening an investigation into the ITC fire. “I would like to thank the Attorney General for acting so quickly on TCEQ’s request to enforce against ICT, LLC,” the environmental agency’s Executive Director Toby Baker said in a statement. So far, Baker said, only air quality violations have been cited in the suit “due to the dynamic, ongoing investigation.” Additional violations, including water quality, will be referred to the Attorney General as part of the action, he said.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By oht_editor | on August 11, 2019 REP. PAUL MITCHELL Editor’s note: Congressman Paul Mitchell, R-Dryden Township recently sent the letter below to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer regarding a proposed gravel mine on the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property in Metamora Township, which is adjacent to the Metamora Landfill Superfund site. Mitchell represents the 10th Congressional District that includes Lapeer County. Dear Gov. Whitmer, I write to express serious concerns about a proposed gravel mine on the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property in Metamora Township. This property is adjacent to the Metamora Landfill Superfund site (“site”) and the impacts this project could have on the local community and groundwater are severe. This issue was initially brought to my attention by my constituents and local stakeholders. At issue is the status of monitoring wells that track the extent and movement of contaminated groundwater emanating from the site, which is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Through multiple discussions and letters expressing these concerns to the EPA, I learned that the responsible parties had not fully complied with a July 2015 order to expand the monitoring wells around the landfill. It is troubling there is not yet a complete monitoring well network in place, especially when there is a proposed development nearby that is likely to heavily use groundwater. On July 16, 2019, after receiving my letters and listening to community concerns, the EPA directed the responsible parties to further revise the Investigation Work Plan to require a more comprehensive strategy to determine the extent of contamination from the landfill and where it is going. That work is still in progress. The EPA continues to address the contamination emanating from the federally regulated site. As they do so, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) must ensure they strictly monitor and study any proposed projects — such as the one at the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property — thoroughly and impartially. The EPA notes in their letter that EGLE would be the primary agency responsible for oversight of large quantity water withdrawals related to mining projects. The EPA has pledged to communicate with EGLE directly about the site, but I also encourage your office to be receptive to our constituents’ concerns about the proposed mine and its impacts. In addition to environmental issues related to the Superfund site, I also want to note my concern and dismay about the influence state-level lobbyists have exerted over state agencies on matters related to gravel mines. As you are surely aware, proponents of opening additional gravel mines in the state through preemption of local control are using a study produced by the Michigan Dept. of Transportation (MDOT) to advance their position. While there is a case to be made for gravel mine development at a general level, any related decisions should be made objectively, openly, and fairly, with feedback and input from all involved parties. That does not seem to be the case with the study in question. Recent media reports revealed evidence that gravel industry lobbyists made substantial and substantive efforts to direct the MDOT staff working on that taxpayer funded study toward the preferred conclusion of mining proponents. The new MDOT Director Paul Ajegba — whom you appointed — rightfully called for an audit of the contracting practices used for that study. As you work to meet the state’s infrastructure needs, I encourage your administration to maintain the principles of local control, impartial governance, and sound science. I look forward to working with your office, EGLE, and other state and federal agencies to ensure that any developments around the Metamora Landfill Superfund site do not endanger human health or pollute our groundwater. For ease of reference, enclosed please find my correspondence to and from the EPA. I encourage you and your Administration to review these materials and listen to all feedback on this issue. Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By oht_editor | on March 27, 2019 The Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP) recently held a 5,000th Verification Celebration in Lansing, highlighting the success of the voluntary program that has helped Lapeer County farms prevent and minimize pollution risks. The milestone represents the work and investment of more than 2,000 producers and agricultural and conservation partners across the state. As a longtime supporter, Michigan Farm Bureau (MFB) and county Farm Bureau members played a significant role in the program’s development, implementation and growth over its first two decades. A turning point for the program — and when the goal was set to reach 5,000 verifications — came in 2011, when legislation supported by MFB and sponsored by now-Senator Kevin Daley, R-Arcadia Township and former Senator Joe Hune, was signed into law. The Lapeer Conservation District has been instrumental in the verification of many dozens of farms in recent years — and that’s good news to the entire county, whether you live on a neighboring farm or miles down the road because the result is a better and healthier environment for all residents. The County Press in our keepsake Progress 2019 edition (March 3) showcased the achievements of local MAEAP verifications. MAEAP is a voluntary environmental program that works individually with farmers to identify and prevent environmental risks on farms that could result in groundwater or surface water contamination. The program evaluates various aspects of farms based on four systems: Farmstead, cropping, livestock, and forest, wetlands and habitat. After mitigating risks on the farm associated with one of the systems, MDARD staff visit the farm to verify the implementation of practices and verify the farm as meeting the program standards. Sen. Daley attended the March 21 event and reflected on the program. “MAEAP helps farmers to be better environmental stewards of their land and is a great example of how the agricultural community, environmental groups, and the government can work together to better the industry,” Daley said. “The 5000th MAEAP verification is a great accomplishment and I am proud to see the success of this program.” A fifth-generation farmer, Lapeer County and Michigan are fortunate to have Daley working on behalf of the agriculture community. He was first elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2009 and represented the 82nd District until 2014, when term limits prevented him from seeking another term. As one of the few farmers in the House at the time, he was the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. In 2018, he was elected to represent the 31st state Senate District, which includes Lapeer, Tuscola and Bay counties. He now serves as chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and is well versed in how MAEAP works. His farm, Daley Acres, is MAEAP verified — as is the Howell Farm owned by Rep. Gary Howell, R-Deerfield Township. Howell and his son, John, operate the farm. Howell has been a member of the Farm Bureau for 34 years, receiving the 2005 Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award. Daley has served on the Lapeer County Farm Bureau Board of Directors, Lapeer County Ag. Preservation Board, and is the former president of the Tri-County Michigan Milk Producers Association. Lapeer County is unique to be served by lawmakers in both Chambers, the House and the Senate, with deep and personal agricultural roots to this community who want the countryside to be free of agricultural pollutants for generations to come. The Lapeer Conservation District, a proud partner of MAEAP with Lapeer County’s legislators, for more than 70 years has worked with local landowners, farmers, governmental agencies, and other organizations to deal with environmental problems. The district board meets at the District Office at 700 South Main St. in Lapeer, Suite 120-C. Meetings are held on the third Thursday of each month at 8 a.m. The public is encouraged to attend.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on September 02, 2018 New directional lights (top left) have been added at Cramton Park in Lapeer following an Aug. 2 chemical burn incident that injured two children, ages 1 and 14. New directional lights (top left) have been added at Cramton Park in Lapeer following an Aug. 2 chemical burn incident that injured two children, ages 1 and 14. LAPEER — The City of Lapeer has installed new directional lighting to improve security at city parks following an Aug. 2 incident when someone put sodium hydroxide on a slide at Cramton Park, resulting in third-degree burns to the legs of a 1-year-old boy. The City of Lapeer operates 13 parks, each one with its own unique physical and logistical issues related to security — and they’re all being reviewed by city staff whether added security measures should be added to the facilities. Lapeer City Manager Dale Kerbyson said discussions are ongoing with leadership at the police department, parks and recreation and the Dept. of Public Works to assess if there may be any vulnerable areas where added measures may enhance security. On Aug. 2 a 1-year-old boy went down a slide at Cramton Park and immediately began to cry and exhibit pain at which time his 14-year-old cousin picked him up, transferring some amounts of the sodium hydroxide onto her skin. The teen was treated and released for her injuries at McLaren Lapeer Region, while the toddler spent several days in the burn unit at Hurley Medical Center in Flint. The slide, located south of Farmers Creek and on the east side of Monroe Street, is more isolated from the rest of the park because it sits further back from Genesee and Monroe streets where it may be less visible to passersby — including police officers. The slide was thoroughly cleaned and has been reopened to public use. Employees with the city’s Dept. of Public Works, said Kerbyson, have since installed two large flood lights on a small brick pump-station building in the far southeast corner of the park — throwing more light in that section of the park to dissuade any further tampering of playscape equipment and improve security to that corner of the park. “We’re looking to put up additional lights around playscapes at other parks,” said Kerbyson, who noted city staff wants to enhance security, but also must be mindful not to create light pollution issues with neighboring residences. There is one video surveillance camera already in use at Cramton Park, and the city may add another unit to the large park. The existing camera did not face the section of the park where the Aug. 2 chemical burn incident occurred. The City maintains numerous other surveillance cameras in the city. The scale of the city’s park and pathway system it maintains, and also polices, is massive. Lapeer has several small neighborhood parks including the quarter-acre Veterans Memorial Park located just east of Main Street off Nepessing Street and Perkins Park in the northwest section of the city. Nearly an acre, this park at the northeast corner of Oregon and Lincoln streets features playground equipment, a pavilion and seasonal portable toilets. Rowden Park, located off North Lapeer Road (M-24), this 65-acre park is the city’s largest and features one mile of continuous asphalt pathway, two boardwalks over wetland areas as well as a playground, sledding hill, two parking lots and year-round bathrooms. The next largest Lapeer park is Prairies & Ponds at Oakdale. This 37.5-acre park located off Genesee Street near Chatfield School includes limestone trails, a floating dock, bridges, a pavilion and nature observation areas. “The City takes great pride in its parks, and we will continue to look at areas and ways we can enhance security, while at the same time not infringe on peoples’ sense of privacy,” Kerbyson said. Police patrols through and around city parks have been increased since the Aug. 2 incident at Cramton Park and the Aug. 26 discovery of a body of a 17-year-old Attica Township boy in the Flint River at Rotary Park — a sevenacre park located along the eastern border of downtown Lapeer on East Nepessing Street. An autopsy determined that Jared Bristol drowned, however police continue their investigation to determine if there were other factors that may have contributed to his death.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on June 17, 2018 The nearly 2,000 acres of the Holloway Reservoir in Marathon and Oregon townships are a favorite recreation spot for locals and visitors alike. The nearly 2,000 acres of the Holloway Reservoir in Marathon and Oregon townships are a favorite recreation spot for locals and visitors alike. COLUMBIAVILLE — According to a Dept. of Natural Resources “Eat Fish Safe Guide” report published by the Michigan Dept. of Health, several species of fish in the Holloway Reservoir are affected by contaminants originating from Lapeer Plating & Plastics. According to the DNR’s Eat Fish Safe Guide, carp caught in the Holloway Reservoir, or in the Flint River between the reservoir and Mott Dam in Flint, should be eaten no more than twice a month. Large and small-mouth bass consumption should be limited to no more than six per year, and rock bass and walleye should be eaten no more frequently than once per month. Each of these species of fish have been found to contain a manmade chemical referred to as PFOS. The Michigan Dept. of Environmental Quality has stated that while swimming in the Holloway Reservoir is safe, swimmers are advised against swallowing water. In Michigan, the Dept. of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) sets the amount of allowable PFOS at 12 parts per trillion (ppt) or less. One ppt equates to a single drop of food coloring in the equivalent of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools. In an Oct. 27, 2017 letter to Lapeer Plating, the MDEQ noted 13 violations of law generally related to EPA requirements. testing of wastewater from Lapeer Plating showed the company “is the primary known contributor of high levels of PFOS to the Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant, and that this pollutant is being passed through to waters of the state as well as stored in the city’s biosolids.” As recent as August 2017, tests showed 19,000 ppt of PFOS originating at Lapeer Plating. Recent PFOS levels found in the Lapeer County areas of the Flint River, including the Holloway Reservoir, range between 50 and 95 parts per billion. PFOS, or Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, is a chemical used in several industries and is found to be a carcinogen in both fish and humans. PFOS collects in plants along riverbeds and lake bottoms and is ingested by fish. It is likely the advisory will remain in effect for “an additional couple of years,” said MDEQ Biologist Joe Bore in a Holloway Lake Association newsletter. According to Bore, PFOS detected in fish has “a short half-life” and therefore conditions will improve quickly once the source of contamination is contained and eliminated.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on April 22, 2018 A monofilament recycling tube is helping state parks locally, and nationwide, collect used fishing line through Michigan Sea Grant and its partnership with the Dept. of Natural Resources fisheries division. A monofilament recycling tube is helping state parks locally, and nationwide, collect used fishing line through Michigan Sea Grant and its partnership with the Dept. of Natural Resources fisheries division. LAPEER COUNTY — Earth Day 2018, which falls on today, Sunday, April 22, and its networks of faithful stewards have chosen plastic pollution as its call to action. Hunters, anglers and outdoor enthusiasts alike have specific plastics that they can help keep out of landfills and the world’s lake, rivers and oceans—namely plastic shell casings from ammunition, plastic targets, and monofilament nylon fishing line, fishing nets, plastic bait cups and other containers. Monofilament fishing line is said to last 600 years in fresh water and is a leading cause of death in marine life, as it either ingests, or get tangled in the discarded lines. To make it easier for anglers to properly dispose of used fishing line, 90 sites across Michigan, including Metamora-Hadley Recreation Area, have a recycling tube provided by Michigan Sea Grant, a cooperative program of the University of Michigan and Michigan State University that is part of the National Sea Grant College Program. The network of 33 university-based Sea Grant programs in coastal states across the country is administered through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Federal funds are matched with funds from state, tribal, business and other non-federal sources to carry out the programs. The other locations throughout the state that have a recycling tube can be found at http:// www.miseagrant.umich.edu/ explore/fisheries/monofilamentrecycling program/ monofilament-recycling-programparticipants/. Millions of spent shotgun shell casing litter ranges and public lands each year. “Sea Grant sent us some tubes, I believe through the DNR Fisheries division,” said Todd Farrell, Park Supervisor at Metamora-Hadley. “We put them out at the fishing pier and that program started several years ago.” It’s not just plastics that Metamora-Hadley tries to reclaim. Farrell said the park puts recycle containers at the camp host sites and that has been in place for at least 10 years. He noted that a former camp host built a container for bottles and cans and the monies collected from those recyclables go back to the camp host program. “We also have recycle containers for cardboard, plastic and metal,” said Farrell. “The camp hosts bring it to the headquarters building for recycling and last year through the DNR we got a recycling container for our day users. We’re just trying to do our part to get people to put their plastic water bottles in there, in particular, by the beach and by the camp host sites. The DNR does encourage everyone to recycle when they visit our state parks.” The monofilament collected is melted down and made into tackle boxes, toys, fishing habitats and plastic pellets that eventually become outdoor furniture and plastic poly lumbers. Plastic drinking water bottles are the biggest challenge with only 23 percent recycled yearly according to the Earth Day Network. Earth Day.org states that many end up in the rivers, lakes and oceans as floating trash. Plastic straws are also on the hit list with 500 million used by Americans each day. Because of the makeup of plastic straws, they are listed as No. 5 plastics and not many recycling centers accept them. EarthDay.org says that 90 percent of the debris in our oceans is plastic—shopping bags, straws, cups, bottles and fishing line—and that only one percent of plastic shopping bags are recycled. Those, too, are a unique type of plastic and have to be taken back to the stores for recycling. Not so easy to recycle is the shell casings, or hulls, from used shotgun shells. Some do reclaim the spent shells and reload them, but the vast majority are discarded because of their complexity. It’s not just plastic that is part of a shotgun shell, as it is made up of paper, metal and plastic. Recycling centers across the nation who do accept the hulls take them apart and resize the different components turning it into plastic poly lumber. An online search found a judge’s chair made from recycled shotgun hulls, while others were turned into toys, coasters, plastic pellets and other home goods. Still, shooting ranges have a myriad of other plastic trash that could be better served as recyclables rather than ending up in landfills. It’s all about being good stewards. Brass is easily used for reloading and many recycling centers pay by the pound for the brass ammunition leftovers. Jack Briggs, range safety officer at Lapeer County Sportsman’s Club noted that the Club does recycle its brass from the various ranges, but he was unsure about the plastic shell casings. Hunters Creek Club in Metamora said they also do not currently recycle their plastic shell casings. Until recyclers find a solution for the ranges, their hands are tied. EarthDay.org has made available a plastic calculator at www.earthday.org/plastic-calculator/ so consumers can see exactly what their plastic footprint looks like and how to properly recycle and how to dispose of plastics.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on December 24, 2017 Thomas Woolley, industrial surveillance, Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant, explains how one of the facilityâ€™s domed secondary treatment clarifiers works to clean wastewater and prepare it for eventual discharge into the Flint River. Thomas Woolley, industrial surveillance, Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant, explains how one of the facilityâ€™s domed secondary treatment clarifiers works to clean wastewater and prepare it for eventual discharge into the Flint River. LAPEER — Officials say they’ve cut the flow of dangerous contaminants through the city’s wastewater treatment plant into the Flint River, but have only just begun to deal with another problem — about 1.5 million gallons of toxic sludge. On Dec. 15, the Michigan Dept. of Environmental Quality issued the City of Lapeer a permit that allows the Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) to move ahead with plans to set up a temporary system to effectively treat the massive amount of sludge so it can be moved to a landfill. The sludge contains polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — a chemical the EPA says has a number of potentially adverse effects on animals and humans, including a possible link to cancer. On Oct. 4, MDEQ announced it had determined elevated levels of PFAS and another related — and dangerous — compound, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), found in the Flint River originated with the Lapeer WWTP, where officials in turn traced it to Lapeer Plating & Plastics. (MDEQ said it didn’t affect drinking water, but could impact fish.) One of the sludge tanks at Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant. The sludge will be “cleaned” soon so that dangerous chemicals can be kept from the environment. MDEQ officials ordered the city and Lapeer Plating to take immediate steps to address the problem. Lapeer City Manager Dale Kerbyson said it’s been a top priority. “We take it extremely seriously and that’s why we got on it so quickly,” he said, noting the MDEQ has “been a good partner” with the city. In a statement to The County Press, Dean Harlow, CEO, Lapeer Plating, said the company “is working cooperatively with the City of Lapeer and MDEQ to evaluate and address potential discharge of water containing residual from (Lapeer Plating’s) operations.” The City of Lapeer accepts municipal sanitary and industrial wastewater from the city, along with parts of Elba and Mayfield townships. Thomas Woolley, industrial surveillance, Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant, holds a sample of water that had been processed by the plant and was headed for its next stop, the Flint River. Thomas Woolley, industrial surveillance, Lapeer WWTP, told The County Press that about 1.5 million gallons of wastewater flow into the plant every day. About the same amount of treated water is discharged daily to the South Branch of the Flint River. The total amount of time from when wastewater enters the treatment facility until is cleaned and discharged into the Flint River is about 30 hours. According to a DEQ letter dated Sept. 7, 2017 sent to Pam Reid, director of the Lapeer Dept. of Public Works, river samples received in June indicated that the Lapeer WWTP was a “significant source of PFOS discharging to the Flint River.” MDEQ notified the city that “The pass-through of pollutants that are, or may become, injurious to the designated uses of the Flint River, including impairment of fisheries, is a violation of” two permits the city needs for the plant, including the permit that allows it to discharge processed water into the Flint River. It further stated an inspection on July 11, 2017 focused on Lapeer Plating & Plastics “because it is the only known metal finisher discharging to the Lapeer WWTP.” According to MDEQ, PFOS and PFAS belong to a class of man-made chemicals used in many industrial applications and consumer products including fire-fighting foams, water proof membranes for outdoor gear, paints and coatings, and non-stick cookware. Used for decades, the chemicals are known to be very stable and do not break down in the environment. (When the persistent nature and potential health effects of the chemicals were identified, their manufacture ceased in the U.S. and use in the chromium electroplating process was phased out by federal regulations in September of 2015.) “PFOS is of particular concern because it bioaccumulates in fish,” wrote Stephanie Kammer, MDEQ district supervisor, in a Sept. 7 letter to the city. In the electroplating industry, the problematic chemical was initially approved as one method to control air emissions. Wooley confirmed that Lapeer Plating was using the chemicals for that purpose. In an Oct. 27 letter to Lapeer Plating, the MDEQ noted 13 violations of law generally related to EPA requirements. The letter noted testing of wastewater from Lapeer Plating that showed the company “is the primary known contributor of high levels of PFOS to the Lapeer WWTP, and that this pollutant is being passed through to waters of the state as well as stored in the city’s biosolids.” In a statement, Harlow told The County Press that the company “is taking all actions requested by the Michigan DEQ to date to address past use and potential discharge of water containing PFOS.” In a Nov. 22 letter to MDEQ, Harlow outlined how the chemicals were previously used by Lapeer Plating and steps taken in the last several months to stem the flow to Lapeer WWTP. Harlow said Lapeer Plating used a PFOS-based chemical starting April 21, 2010 until June. 11, 2013. In October and November, the company “thoroughly cleaned” several tanks “believed to be the original historical source of the PFOS.” The company also ordered a “short-term rental carbon filtering system” and agreed it will take weekly samples for testing until further notice. Other steps taken include removing equipment with potential exposure to storm water, developing a “pollution incident prevention plan,” removal of hazardous waste from the company’s property, among other things. Harlow told The County Press Friday that the company “is in the process of installing a permanent state-of-the-art treatment system to address PFOS in its discharge.” Kerbyson gave credit to Lapeer Plating officials for their attention to the matter and said city staff is meeting with company representatives on a weekly basis. Woolley said test results indicate lowered levels of the chemicals. However, the city is now stuck with a massive amount of sludge that pre-dates the fixes recently implemented. Sludge, oftentimes called “biosolids,” is a result of the heaviest solids that flow into the plant. During the treatment process, the heavy solids are pumped into large holding tanks. The resulting material looks like mud. Woolley said Lapeer WWTP currently has about 1.5 million gallons of sludge being stored. While in the tanks, the heaviest solids sink to the bottom and are pumped through a centrifuge as part of a “dewatering” process. The resulting “dewatered” material can be suitable for use as fertilizer, and in the case of Lapeer WWTP, when enough accumulates it is trucked to local farms. However, Lapeer WWTP must have a permit to do so. MDEQ took away Lapeer WWTP’s permit in September, Woolley said, just before the plant was to truck out another big load to area farms. The reason is simple: the material can’t be used as fertilizer if it’s full of toxic chemicals. “Regarding disposal of your biosolids, careful consideration needs to be made to ensure that contaminants are not transferred from one media to another,” said Carla Davidson, of MDEQ’s water resources division, in an email to city officials on Oct. 3. To address the problematic sludge, a temporary system will be set up by a company contracted by the city. Starting Jan. 5, it will operate 10 hours a day, five days a week, and process 180,000 gallons per day. The purpose will be to essentially clean the sludge by pulling out the dangerous contaminants through the elaborate temporary filtering system. The “clean” sludge will then be landfilled, according to the permit. “There are just many steps here to make sure we completely protect the environment,” Kerbyson said. The permit indicates addressing the problem will take about six weeks. “We’ve got to get rid of what we got,” Woolley said. “Clean out the system.” Kerbyson and Woolley both said it won’t be cheap, but didn’t want to provide a figure on how much it will cost. Kerbyson said Lapeer Plating has agreed to cover any and all associated costs with the project. “We know that the company has committed to covering the costs so we have not turned in a claim to our insurance company,” Kerbyson said. Still, Kerbyson can’t help but think the problem could have been addressed years ago. “The DEQ was aware of the PFOS problem in 2013, and it took them until this summer to mention it to us,” Kerbyson said. “We have this PFOS issue solved and I’m going to say, on an optimistic side, completely cleaned up by the middle of next month,” Kerbyson said. “We did that in six or seven months. If they had notified us in 2013, it would’ve been done years ago.” Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on November 05, 2017 The nearly 23-acre Brown City sewage lagoon system (upper right) has become a favorite resting spot for a gaggle of more than 400 Canada geese as they migrate south. They like it so well they don’t want to leave. The nearly 23-acre Brown City sewage lagoon system (upper right) has become a favorite resting spot for a gaggle of more than 400 Canada geese as they migrate south. They like it so well they don’t want to leave. BROWN CITY — A gaggle of more than 400 Canada geese have taken up temporary residence on the shores of the Brown City municipal sewage lagoons, and City Hall isn’t happy. The problem is that large volumes of goose droppings have elevated the bacteria count level of the partially purified sewer water to the point where it exceeds the allowable standard for discharging it into the adjacent county drain. According to City Manager Clint Holmes, the water is tested once in the spring and once in the fall. The permissible level of fecal coliform established by the Michigan Dept. of Environmental Quality is 200 colonies per 100 milliliters of water. A recent test revealed the city’s lagoons’ level to be 1,065, five times the allowable limit. The Brown City lagoon system property is on the east side of Maple Valley Road just north of M-90. It consists of three cells, or ponds, surrounded and divided by berms of soil. Cell number one covers 6.4 acres holding a maximum 8.25 million gallons of water. Cell number two is the same size. Cell number three covers 10 acres with a maximum holding capacity of 31 million gallons. According to Holmes, the city pumps into the lagoons about 108 million gallons of raw sewage per year. That is between 180,000 and 240,000 gallons per day. Holmes said that the city discharges approximately 96 million gallons of partially purified sewer water per year into the county drain, with another 12 million gallons disappearing through evaporation. The lagoons are designed with a 47.5 million gallon holding capacity, which could store 260,000 gallons of sewage for 180 days before being discharged. Council member Bill Walters summed up the situation for the city council on October 23, saying, “It seems to me we need to see what we can do to get rid of the pooh.” After some discussion about how much a goose eats per day, and how much a goose defecates per day, along with some talk of other more peaceful means of moving the geese on, it was decided that the matter can best be settled by the barrel of a goose gun. Council instructed Holmes to enlist two or three responsible goose hunters for the task of taking enough of the fowl so as to encourage the rest of them to continue on with their migratory journey. As of last Wednesday, Holmes said two hunters had volunteered, with a third expected to sign on later in the day. The hunters were required to furnish the city with a liability release in case of a mishap. Unauthorized hunting on the site is strictly prohibited. Due to the many problems caused for humans by huge numbers of Canada geese stubbornly congregating in places regarded as outside their habitat in the wild, the species is no longer federally protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Along with other state actions, the result is that, though they are not officially designated as “pests,” geese can be readily killed. Your email address will not be published.

While the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to keep the 2018 conventional biofuels level at 15 billion gallons, as called for in the Renewable Fuel Standard, is good news, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) is warning that EPA’s plan to reduce additional levels of required “advanced biofuels” in the nation’s fuel supply will undermine goals to create a more robust renewable fuels industry and greater energy independence. “Renewable fuels have been a tremendous success story for the country and for the rural economy,” said Dale Moore, AFBF executive director of public policy. “The Renewable Fuel Standard has reduced our country’s dependence on foreign crude oil, reduced air pollution, increased farm incomes and provided good-paying jobs in rural America.” The prospects of EPA dialing back the advanced biofuels requirement couldn’t come at a worse time for the current farm economy, according to Michigan Farm Bureau Field Crops and Advisory Specialist, Kate Thiel, citing depressed crop prices below cost of production for major commodities – most notably corn and soybeans. “The reasonable additional biofuel requirements being asked for here would help tremendously in stimulating crop prices as well as provide an economic boost throughout rural Michigan,” Thiel said. “EPA’s intention to reduce the 2018 requirements for advanced renewable fuel to 4.24 billion gallons, down from 4.28 billion gallons this year, not only dampens the prospects for reduced emissions and increased energy security, but also inhibits investment in cleaner, domestic fuels and the infrastructure needed to accommodate higher biofuel blends—all of which are goals of the RFS.” According to AFBF’s Moore, EPA’s proposal includes an overall 2018 biofuel mandate of 19.24 billion gallons, with 15 billion gallons of that in conventional biofuels, or ethanol, and 4.24 billion gallons in advanced biofuels. “The RFS was designed to give American consumers more choices at the pump and lower gas prices, and to utilize biofuel as more than just a gasoline additive with octane-boosting value. But EPA’s 2018 proposal fails to send the signal to the industry that greater infrastructure investment is needed and meaningful marketplace changes need to occur,” Moore said. Farm Bureau is urging EPA to set the advanced biofuel requirements for 2018 at 5.25 billion gallons and the biomass-based diesel volume for 2019 at 2.75 billion gallons. EPA intends to finalize the rule by Nov. 30. Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on August 30, 2017 September is National Food Safety Month and this year’s theme is “Notorious Virus.” September is National Food Safety Month and this year’s theme is “Notorious Virus.” Many people don’t know that viruses can bring about foodborne illness, and they blame it on bacteria, but some of the largest outbreaks in the United States are caused by Norovirus and Hepatitis A – both virulent viruses. Norovirus is often referred to as the “stomach bug.” Many of us have had it without knowing our illness was caused by a virus. Norovirus comes on quickly, usually within a couple hours, and symptoms consist of vomiting and diarrhea, stomach cramping and even fever and body aches. In some at-risk people like the elderly, small children and those with a weakened immune system, it can cause severe dehydration leading to hospital stays. Some in the at-risk population die from their symptoms. The norovirus illness usually lasts no more than a few days in healthy people. The best way to avoid getting norovirus is to wash your hands often, especially if coming in contact with someone with the “stomach bug.” The virus can be infectious for a long time on sinks, and other inanimate objects, so touching something that the sick person touched, like dishes or laundry, can bring about the illness. It can be transferred through food as well, so if you are experiencing symptoms DO NOT prepare food. You should also be sure to rinse all fruit and vegetables, cook food to its required minimum internal temperature, and clean and sanitize kitchen surfaces often. Hepatitis A is quite different from Norovirus. You can have the virus for weeks before showing any symptoms. Some symptoms are the same as with norovirus, but fatigue, joint pain, dark urine and yellowing of the skin (jaundice) also occurs. There can also be pain or discomfort in the area of the liver. Hepatitis A lasts for weeks to several months, and if you believe you have the virus, you should contact your doctor. Hepatitis A can be spread by drinking contaminated water, being close to someone who has the virus, including sexual contact, eating food polluted by sewage, and eating food prepared by someone with the virus if they don’t wash their hands properly after using the toilet. If any of these pertain to you, and you have symptoms, you should make an appointment with your doctor or health center to be tested. There are many other viruses that can cause illness, but these two are the focus of National Food Safety Month this year. Michigan State University Extension recommends you learn about how bacteria and viruses can cause you to be ill, and take precautions like washing your hands well and often to avoid becoming ill.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on August 02, 2017 A windy day looking out on Lake Superior. A windy day looking out on Lake Superior. The Lenawee Conservation District has been awarded three Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) grants by the Great Lakes Commission totaling $300,000. The Lenawee Conservation District projects will address phosphorous and sediment reduction needs at multiple sites throughout the district. “The Great Lakes are a magnificent national and natural treasure, and we have a responsibility to preserve them for generations to come,” said Congressman Tim Walberg, who made the announcement. “The Lenawee Conservation District is doing important work to protect the health of our waterways and communities, and I’m pleased to see their ongoing efforts recognized. These grants also highlight the need to continue funding the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to protect the Great Lakes, which are a vital economic and environmental asset for Michigan and the entire country.” “I’d like to congratulate Lenawee Conservation District for being awarded this grant in support of their work protecting the health and sustainability of our Great Lakes,” said Tim Eder, executive director of the Great Lakes Commission. “This project demonstrates the power of the GLRI to generate critical economic and environmental improvements for communities throughout the region. Thank you to Rep. Walberg for your continued support of this important initiative.” The Great Lakes Commission manages the Great Lakes Sediment and Nutrient Reduction Program, which strategically addresses polluting phosphorus and sediments from entering the Great Lakes Basin with a unique, targeted grassroots approach which awards grants to nonfederal agencies and nonprofit organizations in priority watersheds throughout the region. Funding for this program is provided by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative under a cooperative agreement between the Great Lakes Commission and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on April 27, 2016 LANSING — Individual environmental responsibility was given lip service by nearly eight out of 10 respondents in a recent survey about the Great Lakes, issued the week before Earth Day (April 22). The survey, conducted on behalf of the International Joint Commission (IJC), “was intended to establish baseline data across an array of perceptions ranging from perceived threats to the Great Lakes and the importance of watershed and Great Lakes protection, to awareness of the IJC and cross-border water protection efforts.” While the survey showed a wide range of perceptions, it also could serve as an indictment of public ignorance about the issues that impact the lakes. In one question, for example, participants were asked to name “anything that you feel may pose a threat to the lakes and rivers that surround and feed into the Great Lakes.” Responses indicated that 24 percent didn’t know. 23 percent said invasive species, 13 percent said pollution in general. Agricultural pollution, waste and runoff was cited by only 2 percent of respondents from eight Great Lakes states (including Michigan) and Ontario. “With all the publicity that seems to come from extremist groups that point the finger at agriculture, that’s surprising,” said Laura Campbell, manager of Michigan Farm Bureau’s Agriculture Ecology Department. “But it is good, because farmers are working very hard to protect the Lakes.” Perhaps in keeping with the bafflement of survey takers, “The role of individual responsibility for protecting the health of the lakes (was) cited by 78 percent of respondents, although 30 percent are unsure what steps they can take.” As Earth Day approached last week, Campbell said farmers are leading the way. “The public may not know what to do,” she said, “But farmers are already acting. They are taking individual responsibility for the Great Lakes, and their efforts are far more significant than most people realize.” Oddly, at the same time the 4,000 survey respondents cited individual responsibility for the lakes, 45 percent listed government as responsible for the lakes’ health. More oddly, in the section about watershed protection, government at various levels were cited as being “currently responsible for protecting the health of the Great Lakes basin” by 39 percent of respondents. Farmers, however, tend not to trust in government regulation to accomplish much. In Michigan, Campbell said, the premiere voluntary environmental program in the nation proves that government mandates do little by comparison to collective, voluntary efforts of individuals. “These environmental issues, as well as the lakes and the basin itself, are so complicated that we’re not surprised people are confused,” Campbell said. “But the efforts of farmers in the entire basin show a sense of responsibility toward the lakes and the environment. In Michigan, we have quantifiable results that show the level of concern by farmers and the benefits of that individual action.” She’s referring, of course, to the Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP), which shows that more than 3,100 farms have been verified by an independent state agency as having put practices in place to protect the environment, with a heavy emphasis on water quality and preventing nutrient leaching. Ten thousand additional farms have started in the MAEAP program and already are adding to the impression record which shows that, since 2011, MAEAP-verified farms have: Kept more than 160,000 dump trucks of sediment ON farms and OUT of Michigan waters (if it was concrete, that much would build nearly three Ford Fields). Kept enough nutrients out of Michigan waters to grow nearly 1 million tons of algae (that amount would more than cover Houghton and Higgins Lakes). What is the IJC? The IJC is an international organization created by the Boundary Waters Treaty, signed by Canada and the United States in 1909. It advises the U.S. and Canadian governments on safeguarding the Great Lakes for drinking, swimming, fishing and the health of the ecosystem. Science, transparency and public engagement are principles underlying the Commission’s Great Lakes water quality work. Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on April 27, 2016 The Caro Poet plant will expand to produce 67 million gallons per year, compared to the 55 million gallons it’s producing now. The Caro Poet plant will expand to produce 67 million gallons per year, compared to the 55 million gallons it’s producing now. CARO — While opposition to ethanol production has seen many, varied arguments over the years, most of them have been debunked by efficiency and common sense, according to Dave Gloer, general manager of the Caro Poet plant. “I think four or five years ago, we heard the argument that corn for ethanol was taking food off people’s table, but I don’t hear that much anymore,” Gloer said. “We’ve never used anything but No. 2 yellow commercial grade corn used for animal feed and industrial purposes like plastics. Now the opposition to ethanol seems to come from the oil industry, and it’s evolved into a fight over market share, pure and simple.” Arguments over water use to produce ethanol also become moot when compared to oil production, Gloer said. “We use far less water than oil uses to generate a gallon of gas,” he said. “We use two gallons of water to produce one gallon of ethanol, and the oil industry uses closer to 20.” Actually, depending on the source of information, it takes at least 44 gallons of water to produce one gallon of gasoline, according to Answers.com. If you add in diesel fuel, that number surges to 97 gallons of water per gallon of fuel. Another debunked argument is that it takes more heat units (Btu) to make ethanol that it produces. “If that were true, we would not be in business,” Gloer said. “In this plant, if you look at all the Btu we consume, it’s still one-third of the Btus in a gallon of ethanol. Besides that, a large amount of the Btu we use is for drying the animal feed. That’s not part of the ethanol process. We also burn a lot of Btu as part of our pollution control process according to our permit.” Knowing all that, remember too that ethanol’s process is getting more efficient all the time. “I’ve been here nine years, and the technology improvements are mindboggling,” Gloer said. “When I started, we got 2.7 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn. Now we’re closer to three. The maximum is 3.15, if we convert every bit of starch in the corn. I don’t know if we’ll ever stop getting more yield out of the corn, but we may find that the curve is getting flatter.” As ethanol becomes more efficient to make, Poet plans to follow the trend. It announced in January that it will expand to produce 67 million gallons per year, compared to the 55 million gallons it’s producing now. Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on April 20, 2016 Friday is Earth Day in Lapeer County and across our nation. Each year April 22 marks the anniversary of the birth of the modern environmental movement in 1970. The height of counterculture in the United States, 1970 brought the death of Jimi Hendrix, the last Beatles album, and Simon & Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” War raged in Vietnam and students nationwide overwhelmingly opposed it. At the time, Americans were slurping leaded gas through massive V8 sedans. Industry belched out smoke and sludge with little fear of legal consequences or bad press. Air pollution was commonly accepted as the smell of prosperity. “Environment” was a word that appeared more often in spelling bees than on the evening news. Earth Day 1970 gave voice to that emerging consciousness, channeling the energy of the anti-war protest movement and putting environmental concerns on the front page. The idea for a national day to focus on the environment came to Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson, then a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, after witnessing the ravages of the 1969 massive oil spill in Santa Barbara, Calif. Inspired by the student anti-war movement, he realized that if he could infuse that energy with an emerging public consciousness about air and water pollution, it would force environmental protection onto the national political agenda. Here in Michigan on this Earth Day week we wish to bring to your attention the potential for a massive oil spill that would be hard to contain and clean up — and it’s found deep below the majestic Straits of Mackinac that separate the state’s peninsulas. Each day, according to recent press reports, some 540,000 barrels of light crude oil and natural gas liquids pass below the Straits en route from the shale oil wells of Alberta to refineries in Detroit and Sarnia, Ontario. The pipes, known as Line 5, are 20 inches in diameter, with one-inch-thick walls. The state of Michigan granted the underwater easement in 1953. Line 5’s existence was all but forgotten until another Enbridge pipe, Line 6B, burst open in July 2010 and over 18 hours spewed as much as 1.1 million gallons of heavy crude oil into the Kalamazoo River near the town of Marshall. In the wake of that — the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history — and with the fight raging over TransCanada’s proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline across the Great Plains, environmentalists looked around to see where else Enbridge was moving oil to Michigan. To the surprise of many, they realized that it operated a major line through one of the world’s most sensitive freshwater areas. The Washington Post reported that Attorney General Bill Schuette, a GOP front-runner for governor in 2018, appeared to condemn Line 5 in comments when he released a report last summer from the Michigan Petroleum Pipeline Task Force that he chairs. He told the Post, “You wouldn’t site, and you wouldn’t build and construct pipelines beneath the Straits today.” And yet the Canadian-owned Enbridge company has received a reprieve because Schuette has declined to order an immediate shutdown, as he could under the terms of the state’s agreement with Enbridge regarding the easement. Instead, he established a Pipeline Safety Advisory Board to study all of the state’s spaghetti tangle of pipelines and make recommendations as to what to do. That committee, which has met twice, is ordering up a comprehensive report on how Enbridge would transport the oil and gas in Line 5 to refineries if it could no longer pump it through the Straits. Enbridge’s position is that they’re a better company — that it learned from the Kalamazoo River disaster. They say they’re not the same company that had a long poor maintenance history and that it has pre-positioned equipment in northern Michigan in the event of the unthinkable. Enbridge says to trust them, that their pipelines beneath the Straits are safe. On this Earth Day week, we can’t take the chance they’re wrong and urge our elected lawmakers — Rep. Gary Howell and Sen. Mike Green — to work to insist our state’s abundant fresh water is protected from international pipeline companies. Earth Day matters, every day.

Darryl Haines of Marlette Township hauled corn last fall from leased fields in Burnside Township to the POET Biorefining plant in Caro that produces 53 million gallons of ethanol annually. NORTH BRANCH TWP. — EPA finished off a week of challenging relations with the agriculture community by announcing its long-delayed renewable fuel standards for 2014 through 2016. It adds up to 15.93 billion gallons of renewable fuel for 2014, 16.3 billion gallons in 2015, and 17.40 billion gallons in 2016, according to the EPA’s “ambitious, yet responsible growth” plan for the biofuel industry. “This proposal marks an important step forward in making sure the renewable fuel standard program delivers on the Congressional intent to increase biofuel use, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security,” said Janet McCabe, the acting assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Air, which released the figures Friday. “We believe these proposed volume requirements will provide a strong incentive for continued investment and growth in biofuels.” The standards cover cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and corn ethanol. While the numbers do represent an increase in the amount of biofuel required in the past by the EPA, the proposed volumes are lower than Congress had targeted. It was not what seemingly anyone wanted to hear. “The anti-ethanol crowd, led by grocery chains and corn users, insists that every acre of corn used for ethanol keeps food and feed prices higher than they would be otherwise,” noted Alan Brugler of Brugler Marketing and Management. “Ethanol and corn grower groups aren’t happy because there is surplus corn available both here and around the world, and the proposed targets are below what the actual law required. Lawsuits are expected.Â» “EPA has to be given some credit for attempting to get the RFS back on track by increasing the renewable volume obligations (RVOs) over time,” said Bob Dineen, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. “But the frustrating fact is the agency continues to misunderstand the clear intent of the statute — to drive innovation in both ethanol production and ethanol marketing. The agency has eviscerated the program’s ability to incentivize investments in infrastructure that would break through the blend wall and encourage the commercialization of new technologies. Today’s announcement represents a step backward for the RFS.” Biofuel producers agreed. “Today’s proposal by the EPA puts the oil industry’s agenda ahead of farmers and rural America. While the EPA is correct in recognizing the intent of Congress to continue growth in biofuels, the targets announced today fall well short of rural America’s potential to produce low-cost, clean-burning ethanol,” said Jeff Lautt, CEO of POET, the South Dakota-based ethanol producer. “America’s farmers have answered the call laid out in the Renewable Fuel Standard to help wean our nation off of foreign oil. Agriculture has taken incredible strides in recent years, growing yields through efficient farming practices and technology improvements, and we have all reaped the benefits of that labor through greater availability of high-performance, domestically produced ethanol.” Some members of Congress were also unhappy with the EPA’s proposal. “Unfortunately, EPA’s announcement falls short of accomplishing the goals laid out in the Renewable Fuel Standard,” said U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan), ranking member of theSenate Agriculture Committee. “The advanced biofuels industry creates thousands of jobs in rural America, all while reducing pollution and reducing ourdependencyonforeign oil.” Crop farmers and renewable energy producers got much better news from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack,who made another big biofuels announcement on Friday: the USDA’s new $100 million Biofuels Infrastructure Partnership. “USDA’s investments in renewable fuel infrastructure will help us meet future Renewable Fuel Standard targets and lay the ground work for more investments in advanced biofuels,” Senator Stabenow said. “I applaudUSDAfor supporting producers of renewable energyby getting fuels to consumers at the pump.” The USDA’s grants-based initiative is intended to help states develop the market for renewable fuel, particularly higher ethanol blends such as E15 and E85. “American-made, clean energy sources support the environment, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create jobs and sustain the economy in rural communities across the country. We are fortunate that our farmers are producing record amounts of feedstock for these fuels,” Vilsack said. “However, a combination of factors, including lower commodity prices and reduced demand for feed as the poultry industry recovers from highly pathogenic avian influenza, are creating uncertainty for America’s corn and soybean producers. With this partnership, USDA is helping to ensure the infrastructure is in place for consumers to access more renewable fuels, expand marketing opportunities for farmers, and grow America’s rural economies.” Your email address will not be published.

The top two artist renderings depict a more contemporary structure that could be built without a variance, while the lower two barn-style structures would require approval since it is taller but is the preferred design since it would blend better with the rural nature of the community. OREGON TWP. — Some area residents have been keeping a wary eye on the old Thom farm corner of Marathon and Stanley roads ever since the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) announced a year ago June it would build a water treatment plant there to service Genesee County water customers and possibly the City of Lapeer. Some residents, like Ralph and Sandy Baer, are worried how the 80-acre facility and its 125-million gallon reservoir will affect property values in the area. Ralph said they’ve had their house on the market for a year and have already had some potential buyers walk away when they learned what’s planned for kitty-corner to their home. Area residents became even more concerned when a nine-page letter signed by the “Oregon Township Homeowners Association” (OTHA) started appearing on store counters in the area. Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeffrey Wright called the unsigned document a “manifesto,” and told an Oregon Township Hall meeting room full of residents Sunday that it is full of “misinformation.” Wright and several of his staff members came to Oregon Township on Sunday to reassure residents that KWA is going to be a good neighbor. Wright told residents that despite the OTHA letter’s claim that no state Dept. of Environmental Quality (DEQ) study has been done for the plant, the reason KWA didn’t bring a site plan to the township sooner is that the agency just got DEQ and EPA approval four weeks ago. He dismissed concerns about pollution from the plant saying KWA will be pumping water from Lake Huron that’s “clean to begin with” and treating it at the Oregon Township site with “industrial strength bleach” and powdered lime. Wright noted the lime is the same as the lime that local farmers regularly spread on their fields. Wright noted that KWA will be extending a Consumers Energy gas line south from Columbiaville to the site and instead of bringing it into the property at the corner of Marathon and Thom roads, they’re paying an additional $450,000 to extend the line another half-mile south, giving residents on the west side of Marathon Road access to natural gas. Mark Monson, who’s been a vocal critic of the project, wanted to know why KWA could extend the gas line along Stanley Road from Marathon to Klam Road to offer homeowners along the south side of the planned water treatment plant the same perk and pave Stanley Road all the way to Klam and not just the front gate of the water treatment plant. Wright noted that while the OTHA letter demanded that no trees be cut along Stanley Road, if KWA paved the mile-long section of road, the Lapeer County Road Commission would require it to remove all trees from the right-ofway. Matt Lincoln who owns a farm to the north of the site said he’s worried about how run-off will affect his property. Wright said the site will be managed using Genesee County’s water management standards, which are stricter than those of Lapeer County. He said in addition to the 125-million gallon reservoir, KWA will build a series of detention ponds on the site. While the OTHA letter fretted about employee traffic, Wright said the plant will have 10-12 employees coming and going daily and about one large supply truck a month. He said that will be considerably less traffic than the 14 homes that could have been built on the site. Wright said KWA officials will be back in Oregon Township Nov. 18 to seek a number of variances, none of which are needed for the operation of the plant. He said KWA will be seeking approval for a horse barn-like design for the water treatment plant that will exceed the township’s height limitation, but still be shorter than an existing silo on the site. He said KWA is also asking for permission to build a 200-foot tall cell tower instead of an 80-foot tower. According to Wright, the taller tower would improve cell phone and broadband service in much of the township, and the horse barn design will add $1 million to the cost of the project, but fit better with Oregon Township’s rural character than a contemporary design. The horse barn design’s peaked roof and copulas would push the building’s 35-foot height limitation to 50 feet. Wright said KWA will spend “hundreds of thousands of dollars” to plant trees and shrubs on the western third of the site where the water treatment plant will be and the eastern end of the property where the reservoir will be will look like “a big meadow.” He said once the earthwork is down next summer, KWA will replant the area with native plants. He said the heavy construction is expected to begin about the time farmers put their equipment in the field and be done by harvest time. Wright said construction on the site should be complete by mid-2016. Wright promised once the work is done, residents will barely know the plant is there. He invited residents to visit the KWA’s Henderson Road pump station. He said several people have built houses next to it since it was completed. He said in 60 years of operating water treatment plants, Genesee County has never had a problem that endangered its neighbors. Several residents wanted to know what taking 80 acres off the township’s tax roles will do to the township’s bottom line. Oregon Township Treasurer Cheryl Rhein- O’Neill said it would mean a $1,000 loss in revenue. Wright added that fire hydrants KWA will install every half mile along the pipeline should help fire insurance rates of residents. Wright’s assurances still didn’t convince everyone. Lapeer County Clerk Theresa Spencer, whose family has owned property near the planned water treatment plant noted, “There are still a long list of unknowns.” KWA officials will be in front of the Oregon Township Planning Commission at 7 p.m. Nov. 25 for site plan approval.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on September 03, 2014 PORT SANILAC — Heavy clouds and the threat of severe thunderstorms did not deter about 50 people, mostly lakeshore residents, from voicing opposition to the proposed nuclear waste repository slated to be constructed in Kincardine, Ontario, across Lake Huron from the Sanilac County shoreline. The forum, a town hall-style meeting sponsored by state Senators Mike Green and Phil Pavlov, was held Aug. 26 in Port Sanilac’s harbor gazebo. Equipped with easels displaying charts and maps, and with the horizon of Lake Huron as his backdrop, Pavlov, R-St. Clair Twp., explained the nature of the proposed project, telling the audience, “It is a deep burial disposal system for nuclear waste, the by-product of the Kincardine plant’s eight nuclear reactors, which supply nearly 50 percent of Ontario’s electric power. They currently store their waste in above ground containers. The company (Ontario Power Generation) believes they have a safe geologic formation for deep burial even though the site is located less than a mile from the shore of Lake Huron.” State Sen. Phil Pavlov, R-St. Clair Twp., addressed an audience that gathered Tuesday to hear more about efforts to oppose a proposed nuclear waste dump to be located about a mile from Lake Huron on property of an Ontario electric utility company. Lawmakers and citizens are skeptical. “There’s no safe way to dispose of it,” said Casey Ross of Port Sanilac. “Why are we making more?” “I’m concerned with it polluting our Lake Huron and other Great Lakes,” stated Jackie Armstrong of Lakeport. “I didn’t realize it was that close.” Pavlov told the audience, “My concerns and objections center on two things: proximity and permanence. By that I mean, location and method.” Pavlov pointed to a map highlighting the shoreline position of Kincardine in relation to the Canadian landmass of nearly 4 million square miles. “I don’t believe OPG has done due diligence to explore alternatives,” he said. “They haven’t considered other sites.” Pavlov said, “Above ground storage can be dealt with in the event of a problem. Deep burial is permanent. Once it’s down there it’s down there, and nothing can be done to repair it. The ramifications of a potential disaster are far beyond our capabilities to handle it.” Because of economics, there’s less opposition to the proposal in Kincardine, Pavlov said. Ontario Power Generation, which is owned by the Ontario provincial government is Canada’s largest owner of nuclear power plants, and together with its other facilities produces 60 percent of Ontario’s electric power. In 2008, it became one of Canada’s top 100 employers. In 2014 it reported assets of $38 billion with a net income in the second quarter of $116 million. Despite an “equal interest in clean water on the other side of the board,” said Pavlov, “there’s no outrage in Kincardine because of all the economic benefits.” Jerry Lawrence and Jack Noble of Michigan Steelheaders Association reported that they had visited the Kincardine area and met with officials. The men said that they believe that there are “more suitable sites, perhaps in old tin mines about 250 miles to the east. But why would they want to incur the expense of trucking the waste when they could bury it near the plant? It could be a devastating thing in the future.” “Their (the Canadian) government is not very concerned,” said state Rep. Paul Muxlow, R-Brown City. “Fiftythree thousand barrels of nuclear waste…they say it’s secure for 500 years. What about then? It’s not just about us. It’s about the people to come.” In his remarks, state Sen. Mike Green, R-Mayville, pointed to the complexity of dealing with the issue because it is an international problem. “It’s not like we can pass a law in Lansing and stop it.” This prompted an audience member to ask, “How can we as U.S. citizens influence Canada? We have no right to tell them what to do.” Acknowledging Canadian sovereignty, Pavlov said, “It’s about pressure. We’ve passed five pieces of legislation in the state senate. It’s now in the Michigan house.” Pavlov outlined some of what he called “the mechanisms for pressure”. Citing various boards and commissions, such as the International Joint Commission, the Great Lakes Commission, and certain agreements including the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty, and the Great Lakes Compact, Pavlov said these must be employed to bring concerns to Canadian and U.S. authorities. “We must urge President Obama to invoke the powers he has,” stated Pavlov. “And to do this, we really need you. Spread the word through social media. Learn more about it from the website protectlakehuron.com. Sign the online petitions. Hard copies are on the way. “When we finally get an opportunity to speak over there, we want to present your signatures to the Canadian authorities.” Pavlov said, “They are no where near construction yet. Get engaged. It’s not a done deal.” Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on August 20, 2014 LAPEER COUNTY — Calling a nuclear waste dump proposed for Kincardine, Ontario, less than a mile from Lake Huron, “not safe” and “not acceptable,” a contingent of state legislators in late June asked President Barack Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, the U.S. Congress and other parties to intervene and stop the so-called Deep Geologic Repository. With the Blue Water Bridge and the St. Clair River as a backdrop, State Sen. Phil Pavlov, who represents St. Clair and Lapeer counties, State Rep. Dan Lauwers, of Brockway Township, State Sen. Mike Green, of Mayville, and State Rep. Paul Muxlow, of Brown City, held a press conference on May 19 to demand that the proposed dump be scrapped. All the men are Republicans. The Thumb-area lawmakers have announced measures to stop the construction of a Canadian nuclear waste dump and strengthen the state’s protection of natural resources against radioactive waste. Pavlov also announced the creation of an online petition, www.ProtectLakeHuron.com, and encouraged residents throughout the Thumb and the state of Michigan to sign the petition and add their voices to the call for presidential action. “This proposed facility would pose a critical threat to the health of the Great Lakes and other natural resources throughout Michigan,” said Pavlov, R-St. Clair Township. “I take very seriously my duty as a legislator to protect our natural resources and public health. That is why I will continue to fight the development of this site and ask my fellow residents to join in this effort.” Concurrent Senate and House resolutions call on the president, the secretary of state and Congress to take the appropriate procedural steps to submit a letter of reference or request a binding decision from the International Joint Commission (IJC), the official organization appointed to prevent and resolve disputes over the use of the Great Lakes. A second concurrent resolution would urge the Great Lakes Commission to study the impacts of the facility and take a formal position on it. In addition to banning the importation of all radioactive waste, a bill in the package would extend Michigan’s current ban on nuclear waste disposal to include Class C radioactive waste — the most dangerous form of low-level nuclear waste. The bill also would create the Great Lakes Protection Radioactive Waste Advisory Board to assess a broad range of public health, natural resource, cultural, archaeological and historical consequences of the proposed Ontario facility. “I will ask the board to set an aggressive timetable and conduct public hearings on the matter to determine a wide range of potential impacts,” Pavlov said. “This information-gathering effort and the conclusions from the panel can help bring to light key potential risks from the proposed facility and hopefully help to attract additional national and international attention to calling the facility to a halt.” Green, R-Mayville, added, “The Great Lakes are Michigan’s most valuable natural resource, not only for our ecosystem but for our economy as well. Michigan has a long history of protecting this resource and that’s what we are joining together to do today.” Their co-sponsors in the state House joined Pavlov and Green in unveiling this plan. “These measures put the debate into a scientific forum, which allows for public comment,” said state Rep. Paul Muxlow, R-Brown City. “The process should make it clear to everyone that the development of this nuclear waste disposal facility is unacceptable, and I hope it puts significant pressure on the Canadian government to stop their approval of the site.” Tens of millions of United States and Canadian citizens depend on the Great Lakes for drinking water, fisheries, tourism, recreation and other industrial and economic uses. Placing a permanent nuclear waste burial facility in Kincardine, Ontario could lead to a leak or breach of radioactivity from the facility or to a similar pollution incident, which could severely harm the ecology of the Great Lakes, perhaps permanently. “Michigan’s Great Lakes are one of our most prized resources, and we have a responsibility to protect them,” said state Rep. Andrea LaFontaine, R-Columbus. “This legislation does just that. It prioritizes the conservation of our beautiful water and everything that comes with it. With great things comes great responsibility, so let’s step up to the plate and care for the Great Lakes to the best of our ability.” Under the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty, the IJC, made up of individuals appointed from the U.S. and Canada, is authorized to address international matters relative to the U.S. and Canadian interests in protecting the Great Lakes. An important part of the treaty enables either nation to submit a letter of reference to the IJC for their debate, research and investigation regarding issues having the potential to impact the health of the lakes. The concurrent resolutions pertaining to the IJC urge the legislatures and governors in the seven other Great Lakes states to submit the same request for the U.S. to invoke IJC provisions. Pavlov said he will request that the IJC hold hearings in key locations that will be adversely affected by the facility proposed by the Canadian company Ontario Power Generation. The measures have already gained national attention and praise from key conservation groups. “Burying nuclear waste a quarter mile from the Great Lakes is a shockingly bad idea — it poses a serious threat to people, fish, wildlife and the lakes themselves,” said Andy Buchsbaum, regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation’s Great Lakes Regional Center. “We support this legislative package that asks Canada to reconsider its plan to store large amounts of radioactive waste on the shores of Lake Huron. It’s time to go back to the drawing board to find a solution that doesn’t put our Great Lakes, environment, communities and economy at risk.” James Clift, policy director for the Michigan Environmental Council, added, “The unique elements of the project, such as its nearly unprecedented reliance on limestone to contain emissions from nuclear waste and, most notably, the site’s proximity to Lake Huron, demand that Ontario Power Generation (OPG) take seriously its obligation to consider alternative sites. Unfortunately, the process employed and supporting information provided by OPG to this point do not reflect sufficiently careful analysis of alternative sites.” “As we all get ready to take our families boating, swimming and fishing in the Great Lakes this summer, the implications of this proposed project are really brought home,” said Erin McDonough, executive director of the Michigan United Conservation Clubs. “We appreciate the leadership Senator Pavlov and his legislative partners are showing in proactively addressing the serious issue of burying nuclear waste along Lake Huron’s shoreline.” Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: COVID-19 death toll in Lapeer County rises to 5 By ohtadmin | on August 17, 2014 Sen. Carl Levin Sen. Carl Levin Editor’s note: The following guest column was written by Sen. Carl Levin. Levin is the senior U.S. senator from Michigan and co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force. In July, the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held a hearing on the Great Lakes Ecological and Economic Protection Act, which I introduced along with a bipartisan group of eight Senate cosponsors, including Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, my co-chair on the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, and Michigan’s Sen. Debbie Stabenow. This legislation would help restore and protect the Great Lakes, the largest source of surface freshwater on the planet. It would target the most significant problems facing the Great Lakes and ensure that we implement these projects cost-effectively. The Great Lakes are one of the world’s great treasures, providing drinking water to more than 40 million people; supporting 1.5 million U.S. jobs and $62 billion in wages; transporting critical supplies for manufacturing, electricity generation and food for the world; and supporting the region’s $4.6 trillion economy. The Great Lakes brought industrial and natural resource development to the region, which resulted in tremendous economic development and population growth. This development, however, also resulted in toxic substances polluting the waters and sediments, untreated wastewater threatening public health, and polluted runoff choking habitats and killing aquatic life. The recent toxic algae bloom on Lake Erie that cut off drinking water to a half a million residents is just one example of how much we depend on our lakes. The Great Lakes Ecological and Economic Protection Act, also known as GLEEPA, would tackle problems from past pollution and protect the lakes from current and future threats. GLEEPA would formally authorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, an inter-agency program launched by President Obama in 2009 to implement a regional collaboration strategy developed in 2005 through a process established in an executive order by President George W. Bush. The history of the restoration strategy clearly shows the work of restoring and protecting the Great Lakes is founded on a plan that reflects a broad range of viewpoints and has strong bipartisan support. GLEEPA would focus federal resources on the areas of highest priority identified in the collaborative plan, which would be further refined as new science and information become available. While the GLRI is broadly authorized in the Clean Water Act, passing this legislation would help ensure the program has clear congressional direction and goals, is results-driven and transparent, and implements the most cost-effective solutions. The bill would also formally establish the Great Lakes Advisory Board to provide advice and recommendations concerning restoration and protection. The board would reflect many different viewpoints, including local, state and tribal governments; environmental, agricultural and business organizations; hunters and anglers; and academia. Finally, the bill would formally establish a 10-member interagency task force to coordinate restoration efforts, ensure projects are not duplicated and that they use existing successful programs. GLEEPA also would accelerate progress toward the goals of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, a formal agreement between the U.S. and Canadian governments establishing shared goals for protecting and improving water quality of the Great Lakes. The GLRI has achieved real progress: cleanup of more than 1.3 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment; control of the destructive sea lamprey and restoration of sturgeon, trout and other important fish species; construction and improvement of barriers to prevent an invasion by destructive Asian carp, and planning for additional measures to keep these fish out of the lakes; protection of tens of thousands of vital habitat acreage; and restoration of thousands of miles of rivers for fish passage. GLEEPA would help ensure that progress continues to be made using a solid framework for achieving measurable and outcome-based results. The Great Lakes are precious and irreplaceable. As temporary stewards of this invaluable resource, we must do all we can to restore and protect the Great Lakes for the millions of people who depend on them today and the millions more who will in the future. I’m glad the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee held an important hearing on this vital legislation, and I’m hopeful it can receive approval from the full committee and move on to a vote in the Senate.

 By Sergio Chapa A petrochemical plant located about 120 miles southwest of Houston has entered into $50 million settlement in a lawsuit over polluting Lavaca Bay with plastic pellets. Formosa Plastics Corp., San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and Calhoun County resident Diane Wilson reached the settlement on Tuesday, according to a U.S. District Court filing in Victoria. Company officials reported that the $50 million would go to the newly formed Matagorda Bay Mitigation Trust to promote environmental sustainability in the region. Some of those projects include working with the Matagorda Bay Fishing Cooperative to restore marine ecosystems, environmental restoration work Green Lake Park in Calhoun County, YMCA youth camps, beach restoration and funding the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve's "Nurdle Patrol" to find and remove plastic pellets known as nurdles along area waterways. “The conditions agreed to in this settlement demonstrate Formosa’s commitment to manufacturing our products in a safe and environmentally friendly manner,” Formosa Plastics Corp. USA Executive Vice President Ken Mounger said in a statement. “We will continue to partner with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that FPC USA environmental programs are at the top of our industry.” Downstream: Judge finds Formosa liable for plastic pollution at Texas plant In a statement, Wilson called the settlement a victory for the environment. “The years of fighting to protect the natural resources of the Lavaca Bay-Cox Creek area have finally paid off,” Wilson said. “It’s a huge victory for the environment – and for the people who love and depend upon it. We look forward to working with Formosa to restore the health of our environment and make sure it stays pristine.” Texas RioGrande Legal Aid sued Formosa in July 2017 on behalf Wilson and her group, the San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper. The suit alleged Formosa had polluted waterways near its Point Comfort plant for nearly three decades. Wilson, a Calhoun County native and former shrimper, had fought Formosa since the early 1990s. Employing more than 1,900 employees and 795 contractors, the Point Comfort plant produces resins for plastics such as high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). “A settlement of this size sends a powerful message to corporate polluters – there’s a steep price to pay for flagrant, chronic violations of laws that protect our environment,” Texas RioGrande Legal Aid attorney Erin Gaines said in a statement. “And with plastics pollution of our oceans at a crisis, the message comes at a vital time.” Fuel Fix: Get daily energy news headlines in your inbox Founded in 1954 and headquartered in Taiwan, Formosa was ranked as one of the world's largest chemical companies. Formosa's U.S. headquarters is in New Jersey. Company officials previously said that they have installed multiple screening and control systems to control pollution. The company has said it has the plant has 16 full-time contract employees whose main job is to clean up debris and pellets outside the plant.

 By Chevall Pryce A group of local stakeholders continues working to identify, measure and mitigate direct causes of water pollution in Cypress Creek. The Cypress Creek Watershed Partnership whose members include local government figures, business owners and residents, began hosting public meetings earlier this year to spread the partnership’s message and form a steering committee. The 11-member committee is overseeing the creation of a watershed protection plan, or WPP, to reduce the amount of water pollution within Cypress Creek. Related: Community-led committee to work on fixing Cypress Creek water quality On Nov. 14 and 19, the CCWP hosted work group meetings to discuss possible direct causes for water pollution and brainstorm ideas for measuring those causes. According to data already collected by the CCWP, fecal waste from pets — specifically pet dogs — accounts for approximately 80 percent of the bacteria in the creek. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Houston-Galveston Area Council are facilitating the partnership’s strategy development process with help from a grant provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Justin Bower, senior planner with H-GAC, led the meetings, which he said are meant to gather recommendations and information for the partnership before the steering committee approves recommendations for the next phase of reducing waste in the watershed. Human waste During the Nov. 14 work group meeting at Barbara Bush Library, Bower met with interested community members and local stakeholders to discuss human-related sources, including pet waste. The partnership website states that certain sections of the watershed’s waterways have levels of fecal contaminants exceeding Texas’ limit for recreational use. The fecal contamination comes from a variety of sources, including human wastewater and animals, according to the website. Bower said human waste is more likely to get humans sick than animal waste or other sources. Related: Fecal matter in Cypress Creek prompts watershed protection plan Attendees suggested better educating other community members about the dangers of exposure to stormwater due to pollution, more frequent unannounced testing of wastewater treatment plants, and reinforcing the importance of picking up waste from pets. Part of the issue is knowing generally what kind of waste is coming in-stream, but not being able to pinpoint where exactly the sources of pollution are the worst. For instance, data collected at wastewater treatment plants is being accounted for in the WPP, but the exact levels of pollution along the waterway are not specified. “We recommend looking for resources to do additional in-stream targeted sampling,” Bower said. “Let’s say we have an issue with one tributary. Do some targeted sampling up and down there so we can start to say, ‘It’s good here, it’s good here, what’s in between those.’” Bower said when contaminant sources are found, then the CCWP can work with Harris County and the TCEQ to address those sources contributing to water quality issues. Bower said the CCWP is speaking with apartment complexes and neighborhoods to get a better sense of how many people pick up their pet waste and if they have the resources available to do so, such as pet waste disposal stations. The information gathered may result in a lower documented percentage of waste from pets than was previously thought. “We just assumed when we populated dog numbers that those dogs are producing waste that is making it to the stream, which isn’t necessarily the case,” he said. “We’ll find a conservative estimate to reduce that number by to reflect ownership.” Livestock and wildlife waste While livestock waste, including cows, horses, goats, sheep and pigs, may not be the largest contributor to the pollution of Cypress Creek, Bower said it is still an issue for the partnership to address during the work group meeting about agriculture, wildlife and invasive species’ impact on water quality Nov. 18 at the Weekley Community Center. Currently the CCWP is looking for more direct measurement of livestock populations near the waterways to determine the actual impact and significance of their waste. Bower said the CCWP is already aware they need to reduce their previously measured impact of animal waste on Cypress Creek downstream. “When we looked at the numbers initially, we had about 10 percent of the total amount of watershed coming from cattle or livestock,” he said. “Unsurprisingly most of them are out on the prairie or west of (SH)99. We looked at the cattle numbers versus the stocking rates that some of the district board members suggested ... and our numbers were actually pretty close.” Mary Anne Piacentini, executive director of the Katy Prairie Conservancy, said the conservancy is working to keep cattle from polluting the waterways. “On Warren Ranch all of our streams now are fenced off so the cattle are not getting into our streams,” she said. “So, you’ve got 600 cattle that aren’t getting to the stream that way. The hope is that we’re going to be able to do more of that on our other properties if we get to convert all of our herds.” Just like with other sources, the closer the source is to the stream, within a buffer that the CCWP has determined, the more impact their waste will have on the waterway. Bower said waste from agriculture is not necessarily the main issue, but it still needs to be stopped and people need to be warned to avoid contact with the water if possible. As for species like feral hogs and deer, sparse data is present for either group right now. Feral hogs can be a problem for the watershed due to their high reproductive rates, tendency to destroy vegetation and destabilize streams, along with their waste, Bower said. Bower said feral hog concentrations are higher in the western portion of Harris County with less development. “The largest percent (of waste feral hogs produce) in any of the watershed is about 4 percent before we move the numbers so they’re going to be probably about 6 or 7 (percent) in the western most part,” he said. Deer waste contribution data is also sparse but needs measurement. Bower said data is needed for all other wildlife, but probably won’t be a major consideration unless they have a large impact in larger numbers. For instance, birds are not perceived as having as large of an impact as other sources. What now? The CCWP will host a public meeting Nov. 21 to provide information on past meetings and receive more feedback and suggestions for the WPP. Information about the partnership and future efforts can be found at https://cypresspartnership.weebly.com/. Bower suggested citizens do all they can to prevent waste from polluting waterways by attending CCWP meetings and doing their part within their daily life. “We’re not talking about the old days of the smoke stack coming out of the factory, we’re talking about the cumulative impact of everything everyone’s doing,” he said. “Walk your dog? Pick it up. It’s better than drinking it.” chevall.pryce@chron.com

url: https://www.lakecountystar.com/news/article/Gillibrand-introduces-legislation-to-contain-13845372.php
 Dan Freedman Caption Close Washington Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Wednesday will introduce legislation to force the Environmental Protection Agency to set maximum levels for the class of chemicals involved in drinking-water contamination in Hoosick Falls and other sites in New York. The measure would require the EPA to set maximum levels for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS for short. The EPA would have two years to do it. In February, the EPA issued what its top official termed an "all-encompassing plan" on PFAS but sidestepped setting maximum levels. The agency, which under President Donald Trump has been in the forefront of rolling back pollution regulations, promised to look into setting new levels. Currently there is no maximum established for PFAS, but the EPA has established a health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) in drinking water. Gillibrand's bill, co-authored with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., reflects the skepticism of health and environmental advocates who say they doubt the EPA will buck the chemical industry's lobbyists. "It is the EPA's job to protect Americans from highly toxic chemicals like PFAS, but they have failed to do what is necessary to help ensure our families in New York and across the country are no longer exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS in their drinking water," Gillibrand said in a statement. "This is a widespread crisis that is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk." Gillibrand has been alternating periods of legislative activity on Capitol Hill with appearances on the campaign trail in her bid to become the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. Toxic levels of a variety of PFAS were found in the drinking water in Hoosick Falls in 2014, the result of filtration from a nearby plant producing chemicals for nonstick plastics in cookware and other products. The levels discovered in Hoosick Falls in 2014 ranged from 180 ppt to 540 ppt. Health and environmental experts and advocates say the advisory level of 70 ppt is too high. In December, the New York Drinking Water Quality Council recommended a "maximum contaminant level" of 10 parts per billion for the two PFAS chemicals found in water in Hoosick Falls, Petersburgh, Newburgh and elsewhere in the state. They are PFOA — perfluorooctanoic acid — and PFOS — perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. But the recommendation has not officially been adopted by the state Department of Health. If it were in force, it would be the most stringent state standard in the nation. The chemical industry has gradually withdrawn PFAS from the market, putting in place substitutes like GenX. But advocates have pointed to studies casting doubt on industry claims that GenX and other chemicals like it are much of an improvement. The industry generally has been supportive of efforts to fight contamination, including specific ceilings for PFAS. But they warn against what they see as overkill. "The weight of scientific evidence does not support some of the proposed policies that are currently under consideration," said John Banovetz, a senior vice president at 3M Corp. "In fact, no public health agency in the world has found that PFAS cause harm to human health at past or current exposure levels." He added: "Legislatively dictated, predetermined outcomes that don't follow the science would undermine the integrity of the regulatory process going forward." The discovery of toxins in drinking water turned Hoosick Falls into a ground zero of sorts for chemical pollution in water. PFAS do not dissipate once they infiltrate ground water. Studies have linked the chemicals to kidney, breast and testicular cancer. The EPA designated parts of the village as Superfund cleanup sites, and its drinking water is now filtered by equipment supplied by the plastics manufacturer blamed for causing the pollution, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, a multinational corporation based in France. The village of Hoosick Falls has been involved in legal action against Saint-Gobain and Honeywell International, another operator of a factory in the area. Gillibrand and Capito are both members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which will hold a legislative hearing on chemical pollution next Wednesday. In addition, the House Energy & Commerce subcommittee on environment and climate change, chaired by Rep. Paul Tonko, D-Amsterdam, will hold a hearing Wednesday on 13 House bills also aimed at reining in PFAS pollution. Among them is one authored by freshman Rep. Antonio Delgado, D-Rhinebeck, which would require EPA public reporting of PFAS releases. Among the witnesses testifying will be Emily Marpe, a mother and community member from Petersburgh.

 By Brian Nearing Watervliet A military contractor at the Watervliet Arsenal is paying a $50,000 fine for failing to properly maintain air pollution control equipment, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Hartchrom Inc., a chrome plating company that lines cannon tubes for the U.S. Army, also agreed to improve its inspection and record-keeping for equipment used to control pollution from its chroming process. During two visits to the Building 35 facility in early August 2018, state inspectors found that Hartchrom workers were failing to inspect the pollution control equipment for cracks or leaks. The inspectors then discovered cracks in equipment meant to remove chromium, a toxic, carcinogenic heavy metal. If Hartchrom fixes the issues, DEC agreed to suspend an additional $10,000 fine, according to an agreement signed by DEC and Hartchrom last month. Calls to Hartchrom for comment Tuesday weren't returned. Calls to Michael Sterthous, an Albany-based lawyer for Hartchrom, which has been at the arsenal since 2002, for comment also weren't returned. In March 2017, the Swiss-based company was awarded a $17 million contract from the U.S. Army to perform chrome-plating and surfacing operations for cannon barrels on 120 millimeter and 155 millimeter cannon. According to a DEC statement, the agency has "no evidence of Hartchrom violating emission standards." When pollution equipment was tested by state inspectors in October 2015, it was found to be operating within acceptable limits, according to DEC. When the cracks were found in August 2018, the equipment was again found to be working properly. DEC indicated that Hartchrom was last cited by DEC in 2010 for violations that included beginning construction without a permit. In 2014, the company got into a dispute with arsenal managers over the company's attempted improper disposal of tainted production liquid at the facility's wastewater treatment plant. Arsenal officials stopped the company from dumping 39,000 gallons of tainted liquid, forcing Hartchrom to dispose of the liquid as hazardous waste. Afterward, Hartchrom tried to recoup what it claimed were more than $92,000 in disposal and lost revenue expenses from the U.S. Army. But last year, the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals denied the claim. Calls to arsenal officials for comment weren't returned. Last year, the Army took back management control of the arsenal from the not-for-profit Arsenal Business & Technology Partnership, which had brought in Hartchrom as a tenant.

 By Brian Nearing Schenectady Toxic chemicals will be dug out of two vacant former dry cleaners sites in Schenectady and Watervliet, under plans announced by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The property around the former Admiral Cleaners, 617 19th St., Watervliet, and the former Kenwood Cleaners, 445 Duane Ave., Schenectady, are tainted with high levels of a carcinogenic dry cleaning solvent, tetrachloroethene (PCE), and related toxic byproducts. Exposure to PCE likely increases cancer risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Primary effects from chronic, long-term inhalation exposure are neurological, including impaired cognitive and motor neurobehavioral performance, according to EPA. PCE exposure may also "cause adverse effects in the kidney, liver, immune system and hematologic system, and on development and reproduction," according to the EPA. DEC plans to dig up and dispose of about 15 feet of PCE-tainted soil around the Admiral site and remove an underground storage tank, according to agency paperwork. The site closed in 2017, but had been a dry cleaners since 1950 before closing in 2013 due to environmental violations. After that, it was used as a drop-off shop for dry cleaning, where clothes were taken elsewhere to be cleaned. The $400,000 cost of the program would be paid for the by the state Superfund program, which covers the expense of cleanups when the person or company responsible for the pollution cannot pay or refuses to do so. A copy of the plan can be found in the office of the Watervliet city clerk at 2 Fifteenth St., Watervliet. At the former Kenwood site, about 20 feet of PCE-tainted soil will be removed and disposed of as part of a $1.1 million cleanup plan, according to DEC paperwork. It also will be paid for through the state Superfund program. The cleaners opened in 1950, and operated as late as the 1980s, according to DEC. PCE was found in both the ground and groundwater at levels well beyond state safety standards. PCE vapors were also found to be leaking out of the ground, including at one unspecified "off-site" location. A copy of the plan can be found at the Phyllis Bornt Branch Library, 948 State St., Schenectady.

 MNA Staff Caption Close From the Lansing State Journal LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Scientists want to use an unconventional method to remove pollution at former General Motors properties near Lansing where an underground plume of chemicals is creeping toward drinking water wells. The Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust controls the former GM plants. It is proposing a remediation method called "biosparging," which removes pollution by injecting air into groundwater. The method encourages bacteria to consume 1,4-dioxane, an industrial chemical that GM used to clean oil off car parts. Should the trust gain state approval, the project would be among the first and likely the largest to use the method, the Lansing State Journal reported . It's unclear how much the project would cost, but engineers said it could take six to 12 years to fully clean the water. The pollution was discovered after the trust was established by the federal government to take over the GM sites following the company's bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. The dioxane plume is located under two former GM plants in Lansing Township and Lansing. Dave Favero, deputy cleanup manager for the Michigan properties, said dioxane is very soluble. If dioxane is in oil, as it was used at the GM plants, "it leaches out and starts to migrate with the groundwater," he said. Long-term exposure could lead to liver, kidney and reproductive problems and possibly cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Lansing-area plume is within the Lansing Board of Water and Light's wellhead protection area for some of its drinking water wells. Up to 10 of the utility's wells are downstream from the polluted groundwater. The utility started monitoring for dioxane in 2015, and found a small amount within the limits of what the EPA considers safe. The utility hasn't monitored dioxane levels that exceed the EPA's safe limit yet. The trust will need to get approval from state environmental regulators. Scientists and engineers could begin installing biosparging wells this year if the plan is approved.

 By Brian Nearing Troy Petroleum giant Chevron could pay about $1.8 million to clean up a former industrial site in South Troy once used to make manufactured coal gas and later to store asphalt, according to a plan being considered by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Work at the 7-acre Water Street property, located just south of the Route 378 (Menands) bridge, should start next year and last about nine months, according to a DEC notice this week. Storage tanks on the site were removed in 2006 and the site is currently vacant. California-based Chevron USA Inc. would pay to remove about 725 cubic yards of soil contaminated with nearly a dozen industrial chemicals, tar and asphalt left behind when the site closed in 1999 after at least seven decades of industrial use, first for plants that manufactured coal coke and gas, and then for asphalt storage and distribution. The ground is now polluted with aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzopyrene, benzoanthracene, benzene, toluene, arsenic and xylene. Tests have found coal tar as far as 11 feet underground. Once the contaminated soil is removed, the cleanup plan calls for the site to be covered with soil "acceptable for commercial and industrial land use," according to DEC. The land has been filled in with "slag, cinders, brick, gravel and other materials" over the past, according to DEC. DEC will hold a public hearing on the proposal at 7 p.m. Feb. 20 at Troy City Hall, 433 River St., and is taking public comments on the plan Feb. 1 through March 2, through John Spellman, project manager, NYSDEC, Division of Environmental Remediation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233, or john.spellman@dec.ny.gov. A copy of the proposal is available for public inspection at the Troy Public Library, 100 Second St., Troy.

 By Marissa Luck Exxon Mobil, under pressure from shareholders, has agreed to report plastic pellet spills from its polymer production plants to prevent ocean pollution, according to a shareholder group that focuses on corporate responsibility. The shareholder group, As You Sow, filed a proposed shareholder resolution in January with several major petrochemical producers, including Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical, Phillips 66 and Chevron, asking for annual reporting on spills and measures taken to prevent and clean up spills. Exxon appears to be the first company to succumb to the pressure. Under a deal struck with As You Sow, Exxon will begin providing details about whether any spills occurred, specifics about how it is monitoring for spills and how it is managing pellets. It will also describe how the company assesses the effectiveness of pellet loss prevention measures. The company apparently did not have any spills though in 2018, according to As You Sow. As a result of the agreement, As You Sow withdrew its shareholder proposal, according to SEC documents. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond what was said in the SEC documents acknowledging the withdrawal of the shareholder proposal. RELATED: Reporter’s Notebook: Can chemistry fix the plastic waste problem? "We are pleased that Exxon Mobil has agreed to do public reporting on plastic pellet spills and management," said Conrad MacKerron, senior vice president at As You Sow in a statement. "It is important for all industry players to establish similar transparency so stakeholders can get a realistic view of the size and scope of this problem. We hope the other companies we are engaged with will follow its lead. 260 species affected Exxon's petrochemical division has several plants that produce plastic pellets, called nurdles, which are used to produce thousands of everyday plastic products. These tiny plastic pellets, which can be spilled during handling and transportation and swept into waterways, are estimated to be the second largest direct source of microplastic pollution to the ocean by weight. The tiny pellets, the size of fish eggs, make their way onto shorelines, beaches and break up into smaller pieces that animals can mistake as food. Plastic pollution affects 260 species, causing fatalities from ingestion, entanglement, suffocation and drowning, according to As You Sow. Exxon Mobil is the first major petrochemical producer to agree to report information on plastic pellet spills publicly to shareholders, said Jane Patton, coordinator based in New Orleans with the anti-plastic pollution advocacy movement Break Free From Plastic. "This is significant and huge," Patton said. "I'm glad they're willing to disclose this, but there is a lot more that Exxon needs to be doing to mitigate harm to local communities" that comes as a result of air and waste pollution from petrochemical plants." Many petrochemical companies are involved in a program called Operation Clean Sweep that aims to promote best practices for pellet management and containment to prevent pellet spills.But As You Sow has criticized the group because it doesn't require companies to publicly report spills or plastic management methods. TEAMING UP: LyondellBasell, Dow chiefs call on industry to fix plastic waste problem The other shareholder proposals filed with Chevron, Phillips 66 and Dow Chemical will likely be voted on during shareholder meetings this spring. Taking responsibility As You Sow last year was involved in successful efforts to push Starbucks to ditch plastic straws and pressure KraftHeinz, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and others to commit to increase the use of recycled packaging in their products. Chuck Venezia, senior vice president of petrochemicals at the analyst and research firm Argus Media, said petrochemical companies typically have redundant systems to prevent spills because it's in their best economic interest to avoid losing the product. The issue of plastic pellet spills has not been a major focus area yet for the industry, but he noted that the industry is starting to take more responsibility for reducing plastic waste through better waste management systems, community education and recycling initiatives. "There are so many benefits to plastics that are not getting reported – but just like everything else they need to be handled and treated properly," Venezia said. Ashish Chitalia, polyolefin analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the industry is responding broader backlash against single-use plastics with initiatives such as the nonprofit the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. "We expect to see broader participation in reporting the plastic pellet losses, as doing so may enable companies to improve their economics, standard handling procedure and their sustainability goals," Chitalia said.

 By Taylor Goldenstein AUSTIN — Attorney General Ken Paxton, on behalf of the state’s top regulatory agency, filed suit Friday against the company responsible for the Deer Park fire, alleging it released pollution in violation of the Texas Clean Air Act. In the 18-page suit filed in a Travis County district court, Paxton seeks a citation and civil penalties against Intercontinental Terminals Company, the liquid storage terminal company whose facility caused a series of fires this week, for violations of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality rules. The violations include unauthorized air pollution, outdoor burning and visible emissions. Paxton also seeks an injunction to force the company to comply with the law. “The state of Texas works hard to maintain good air quality and will hold ITC accountable for the damage it has done to our environment,” Paxton said in a statement. “ITC has a history of environmental violations, and this latest incident is especially disturbing and frightening. No company can be allowed to disrupt lives and put public health and safety at risk.” For subscribers: Latest fire contained at charred Deer Park plant The TCEQ continues to monitor the air quality in the affected areas about 20 miles east of Houston. The federal Chemical Safety Board, which investigates serious chemical accidents, announced Thursday that it is opening an investigation into the ITC fire. “I would like to thank the Attorney General for acting so quickly on TCEQ’s request to enforce against ICT, LLC,” the environmental agency’s Executive Director Toby Baker said in a statement. So far, Baker said, only air quality violations have been cited in the suit “due to the dynamic, ongoing investigation.” Additional violations, including water quality, will be referred to the Attorney General as part of the action, he said.

 By Erin Douglas Caption Close Companies found to have emitted the most air pollutants in 2017 in Texas, according to an environmental report, are in some cases pinning the blame on Hurricane Harvey, as well as unique one-time plant upsets and maintenance. A recent report based on data filed by companies to state regulators identified Texas' top air polluting companies. Environment Texas, an environmental policy nonprofit that analyzed the data and produces the yearly report, found that the Houston metro area, home to several refineries and petrochemical plants, had the second most unauthorized releases of pollutants in the state. RELATED: Texas for most unauthorized pollution, environmental study finds Companies can receive permits to regularly emit pollution while operating major industrial sites. When facilities exceed those permitted levels, companies are required to report the incidents to state regulators with information that includes how much they emitted and the duration of the incident. Using those filings of unauthorized emissions, Environment Texas found in its yearly analysis, that hundreds of companies reported over 4,000 unauthorized pollution incidents in 2017, up a little over 9 percent from the previous year. The group has conducted the annual assessment since 2015. Companies file emissions event reports each time a plant has an unauthorized release of pollutants due to a malfunction or planned activity, such as equipment maintenance. If the plant claims and proves that the excess emissions were not preventable, among other criteria, then no fine is imposed. Both Exxon Mobil and Magellan Midstream Partners mentioned the hurricane as a key contributor to the high emissions their plants produced in 2017. But Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said he does not believe this is a valid excuse for the pollutants. He pointed to several Corpus Christi plants, which shut down operations several days prior to the hurricane making landfall. "Certainly there were increases in emissions for some facilities during the hurricane, but we think many, if not most were preventable," Metzger said. "These (events) are preventable if companies take the time, spend the money and train their workers to control emissions." The hurricane may have contributed to 8.3 million pounds of air pollution released by industrial plants immediately before, during and after the storm, as a result of waiting too long to shut down, according to a separate report by the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit organization. Other companies said that the high levels of emissions during 2017 were due to scheduled, one-time work and other singular events. Metzger, however, said contrary to these being one-time events, data from prior years show that violations are ongoing and occur over and over again. PLASTICS: For LyondellBasell CEO, pollution is personal In 2017, 275 companies reported over 4,000 emissions events that resulted in the release of more than 63 million pounds of air pollution in the state, up 27 percent from 2016. As a comparison, the average American family emits 411 pounds of sulfur dioxide each year, according to the Leonardo Academy, a nonprofit that quantifies environmental impacts. The Environment Texas report questioned how effective the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's regulatory process is, showing that enforcement has decreased as a percent of emissions events since 2011. There were more than 4,000 reported unauthorized emissions events reported in the state in 2017, yet the TCEQ only imposed penalties on 58 emissions events that year, data showed. The TCEQ declined to comment on the report specifically, but Brian McGovern, TCEQ spokesperson, said the commission "vigorously" defends its enforcement process. Here are facilities with the greatest unauthorized emissions, according to the Environment Texas analysis: 1. Waha Header Compressor Station, Trans-Pecos Pipeline LLC 3.88 million total pounds "This was the result of an isolated event due to scheduled work that occurred on the pipeline back in 2017," wrote Lisa Dillinger, spokesperson for Energy Transfer, in a statement. "This is not something that will be re-occurring." 2. Mabee Ranch CO2 Plant, Chevron USA Inc. 3.26 million total pounds "In February 2017, we experienced an event at the Mabee C02 Plant, which accounted for over 80 percent of the facility's emissions referenced in the report," wrote Veronica Flores-Paniagua, spokesperson for Chevron, in a statement. "In 2018, we made significant investments in the McElroy field and Mabee C02 Plant to decrease emissions and improve reliability." 3. Seminole Gas Processing Plant, Hess Corporation, OXY USA Inc. 3.03 million total pounds "Occidental took over operatorship of the Seminole Plant in September 2017, and is actively investing in programs to control, monitor and minimize emissions from that plant as we do for all of our operated assets," wrote Susie Geiger, spokesperson for Occidental, in a statement. 4. Galena Park Terminal, Magellan Terminal Holding LP 2.53 million total pounds "Like many others in the energy industry with facilities along the Texas Gulf Coast, in 2017 our Galena Park facility experienced record breaking rainfall and flooding from Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in a petroleum products release and associated emissions event," wrote Bruce Heine, spokesperson for Magellan Midstream Partners in a statement. 5. Silvertio 76 17 Unit P 1H, Anadarko E&P Onshore LLC 2.16 million total pounds "The emissions cited in the report are related to a well-control event that occurred in 2017," wrote John Christiansen, spokesperson for Anadarko Petroleum. "We reported both the event and associated emissions to the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, respectively, with the Railroad Commission overseeing the cleanup that was completed in 2017." 6. ExxonMobil Beaumont Refinery, ExxonMobil Oil Corp. 1.74 million total pounds "The Environment Texas report compiles emissions data submitted to TCEQ for isolated events," wrote Sarah Nordin, spokesperson for ExxonMobil Oil Corp. "Compiling this data does not tell the whole story, especially in 2017 with the impacts of Hurricane Harvey." 7. James Lake Gas Plant, James Lake Midstream LLC 1.57 million total pounds James Lake Midstream could not be reached for comment. 8. JT McElroy 202 TB, Chevron USA Inc. 1.53 million total pounds "In 2018, we made significant investments in the McElroy field and Mabee C02 Plant to decrease emissions and improve reliability," wrote Veronica Flores-Paniagua, spokesperson for Chevron, in a statement. 9.

 Sudhin Thanawala, Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Wildfires in California in 2018 released the rough equivalent of about 68 million tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide — about the same amount of carbon emissions as are produced in a year to provide electricity to the state, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Friday. The carbon dioxide figure — based on data analyzed by the U.S. Geological Survey — is more than 15 percent of all emissions produced by California in a year, according to Zinke. "We know that wildfires can be deadly and cost billions of dollars, but this analysis from the U.S. Geological Survey also shows just how bad catastrophic fires are for the environment and for the public's health," Zinke said in a statement. This year included California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire — a blaze in November that took out nearly 14,000 homes in a rural Northern California county and killed at least 88 people. Another fire that started the same day in Southern California killed three people and destroyed 1,500 structures, including the homes of celebrities in tony Malibu. Those two fires produced emissions equivalent to roughly 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide, Zinke said. The 2018 emissions figure for California wildfires is "strikingly high, significant in the context of overall statewide emissions, and likely a record value for single-year direct carbon emissions from wildfires in California history," said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "It is an alarming number, but we live in a fire-prone state," said Dick Cameron, director of science for land programs at the California chapter of the Nature Conservancy. Zinke used the carbon figure he released Friday to continue to push for the thinning of forests. Cameron said that would help but that climate and home construction were also significant factors in the destructiveness of the fires. Cameron cautioned that wildfire emissions were still a relatively small component of climate changing greenhouse gases. In California, cars and other transportation account for more than 40 percent of total emissions.

 By Brian Nearing Green Island A pollution cleanup for a planned $60 million project at the site of a former oil tank farm on a Hudson River island will continue until early 2020, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The 11.2-acre vacant property, just south of the Green Island Bridge on what is called Center Island, was once home to King Fuels, which closed in 2008 after nearly a century of use as an oil terminal. Peter Luizzi & Bros. Contracting of Albany wants to build a marina there as part of a mixed-used residential and commercial development called Starbuck Island. So far, the developer has pumped out underground oil from the site and removed some tainted soils, said Sean Ward, executive assistant to Green Island Mayor Ellen M. McNulty-Ryan. "The hole dug there must be about 30 feet deep," he said. Now, the site must be refilled and covered over with about two feet of clean soil to meet state pollution standards for "restricted residential use," according to a notice issued Wednesday by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The DEC notice said this work will begin this month and continue for about 15 months. Luizzi wants to construct 250 housing units, along with a marina, offices, restaurants and shops. The plan also calls for 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of commercial and retail space, 5,000 to 10,000 square feet of office space, 8,000 to 10,000 square feet of restaurants, and other amenities. Pollution tests of the site done in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2016 found levels of barium, lead, mercury and other chemicals in the ground and water. This year, DEC has overseen the removal of tons of tainted soil contaminated by fuel oil and other chemicals. Investigations in 2017 found a 3-foot-thick layer of liquid petroleum about 25 feet underground. State-ordered tests also found that the site was made up of as much as 28 feet of "historic fill materials including ash, brick, glass and other waste materials." Cleanup plans included: — Removal of underground storage tanks.— Collection and testing of groundwater.— Injection of chemical stabilizers to neutralize contaminated groundwater.— Filling in and covering over remediated areas with clean soil.— Installation of a "cover system" consisting of building foundations, retaining walls, rip-rap, asphalt roads and walkways.— Areas not paved over will be covered with 2 feet of clean soil in order to meet state safety standards for residential areas.— Installation of vapor intrusion mitigation systems in all on-site buildings.— Creation of a health and safety plan, and a community air monitoring plan as the cleanup continues.

 By Kenneth C. Crowe II Caption Close NASSAU – The town crowned Tributary T-11A as Little Thunder Brook to transform it from a quiet little stream that’s been polluted by the Dewey Loeffel Landfill Superfund Site to a war cry recalling the community’s 19th century history of fighting back. “Referring to the stream at T-11A doesn’t do it justice. We’re trying to stand up for rural New Yorkers who’ve been ignored,” said Supervisor David Fleming. The Town Board reached back 175 years to capture the fury of the Anti-Rent Wars that shook upstate New York in the 1840s. Frank Abbott fought under the name Little Thunder when he led his neighbors dressed as Indians to protest high rents. They even tarred and feathered their opponents as they fought for their cause. “Frank Abbott helped to bring down politicians that ignored the rights of rural residents. In this fight for our collective future, it is fitting that we honor Abbott’s legacy with the healing represented by the work about to start on Little Thunder Brook,” Fleming said. The town sees itself standing up to Albany and Washington, D.C. using Little Thunder to shout out for attention to neglected issues. The heavily polluted Dewey Loeffel Landfill became a toxic dump when an estimated 46,000 tons of industrial waste were buried at the site. The toxic materials included industrial solvents, waste oil, PCBs, scrap materials, sludge and solids. Soil and sediment along Little Thunder Creek is contaminated with PCBs -- polychlorinated biphenyls --a suspected carcinogen. Little Thunder Creek is a 1,900-foot-long tributary of the Valatie Kill, a protected trout stream that empties into Kinderhook Lake in Columbia County. Until the Town Board acted earlier this month, the creek was unnamed, known only by its forgettable bureaucratic designation of T-11A. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2 Office said in a statement it fully supports the renaming. "EPA encourages community members and their representatives to become involved in the issues that affect their communities. We welcome new ideas to target air, water, and other pollution. Community engagement and grassroots involvement is crucial to addressing environmental concerns such as the contamination in and around the Dewey Loeffel Superfund site," its statement said. The symbolism evoked by the name Little Thunder can be a rallying point for residents and a platform to launch additional action, said Jennifer Dodge, an assistant professor at the state University at Albany’s Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy. “What we can understand from this type of symbolic politics is what is at stake for people in an issue, in addition to the tactical and strategic issues… In the Nassau story, the strategy of naming the river Little Thunder might work well to get people mobilized because they might identify with the “little guy takes on the government” narrative..,” said Dodge, an expert on framing facts, symbolic politics and environmental policy conflicts. The question remains if the new name will be as successful “in the sense of raising the issues up, that is, about the contamination of the water and potentially the human health effects, which is a very powerful narrative in politics,” Dodge said. Dan Shapley, Water Quality Program director for Riverkeeper, said the health of the smallest tributaries impact the Hudson River. "Naming a stream is a simple and powerful act. Once we've ennobled a stream with a name, it's harder to neglect and pollute it. And I have to add, Little Thunder Brook is an awesome name," Shapley said in a statement. Cleanup work is under way at Little Thunder Creek. The General Electric Co. is removing contaminated soil and sediments along the creek. These will be replaced with clean backfill; the stream channel will be restored; and trees and shrubs will be planted. The EPA has said the work will be completed in early 2019.

 By Marissa Luck With more plastics piling into rivers and oceans, several of the world's biggest plastic chemical manufacturers are joining together in an industry-led effort to curb plastic waste. A group of nearly 30 global companies have committed more than $1 billion into developing programs and technologies to better minimize, manage and prevent plastic waste. LyondellBasell of Houston, Chevron Phillips Chemical of The Woodlands, ExxonMobil of Irving as well as BASF, Shell Chemical, Dow and Procter and Gamble are among the two dozen companies forming a nonprofit called Alliance to End Plastic Waste, according to a joint announcement from the companies. The goal is commit $1.5 billion over the next five years to fighting plastic waste; so far over $1 billion has been pledged with new members being added, an Alliance spokesperson said. The nonprofit's initial set of investments and projects include: From HoustonChronicle.com: Can sputtering recycling market find a second life? Over the next few months the alliance will incorporate additional investments tied to, education, technological innovation and cleanup of highly-polluted areas. "Everyone agrees that plastic waste does not belong in our oceans or anywhere in the environment. This is a complex and serious global challenge that calls for swift action and strong leadership. This new alliance is the most comprehensive effort to date to end plastic waste in the environment," said David Taylor, CEO of Procter & Gamble, and chairman of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, in a statement. The nonprofit will focus much of its efforts in Southeast Asia where plastic pollution is the worst. About 55 to 60 percent of the world's plastic pollution originates in five emerging markets – China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, according to research from the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit, Ocean Conservancy. About 80 percent of the world's plastic waste starts on land and is carried out to ocean in rivers and waterways, including eight major rivers in Asia and two major rivers in Africa, according to the Ocean Conservancy and research from the journal Environmental Science and Technology. The alliance is unique in that it includes companies across the plastic value chain – from oil majors with hands in the petrochemical industry such as Total, Exxon, Shell and Chevron to consumer good household brands like Procter & Gamble to companies that collect and manage plastic waste. The alliance also includes Berry Global, Braskem, Clariant, Covestro, Versalis, Eni's chemical company, DSM, Formosa Plastics, Henkel, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings, Mitsui Chemicals, Nova Chemicals, OxyChem, Reliance Industries, SABIC, Sasol, Suez, SCG Chemicals, Sumitomo Chemical, Total and Veolia. Environmentalists were quick to criticize the new nonprofit as a band aide solution for the real problem - the growing use of single-use plastics globally. "This is a desperate attempt from corporate polluters to maintain the status quo on plastics. ... Make no mistake about it: plastics are a lifeline for the dying fossil fuel industry, and today's announcement goes to show how far companies will go to preserve it," said Graham Forbes, global plastics project leader for Greenpeace, a global environmental non-governmental organization. Forbes noted that just 9 percent of plastics ever made have actually been recycled, according to research in the journal Science Advances, "but corporations love to use recycling as a crutch to continue production of cheap plastics." Jacqueline Savitz with Oceana, a D.C.-based ocean conservation nonprofit, argued that reducing single use plastic is the only way to combat pollution. "The industry coalition's promise to solve the plastic pollution crisis with waste management and cleanup is a nice dream, but it's not sufficient to solve the plastic problem. Companies like Procter and Gamble, Nestlé, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola must take responsibility to reduce the amount of single-use plastics they're pumping into commerce by adopting alternative packaging for their products," Savitz said in a statement. Shareholder pressure The announcement about the alliance comes as the plastic and petrochemical industry is under growing pressure to tackle pollution. About 8 million metric tons of plastic waste wind up in oceans every year, according to the Ocean Conservancy. Last week shareholders with the advocacy group As You Sow filed shareholder proposals with four of the world's biggest manufacturers of plastic resins – the tiny pellets that go into plastics also called nurdles – including Chevron, DowDupont, ExxonMobil and Phillips 66. The proposals ask for annual reports disclosing plastic pellet spills and measures taken to prevent and clean up any spills. These tiny pellets, the size of lentils, are estimated to be the second largest direct source of microplastic pollution to the ocean by weight, according to the UK environmental consultancy group Fauna and Flora. EARLIER: Plastic bottle recycling dips amid industry ‘transformation’ Although these four companies are members of Operation Clean Sweep, an industry initiative with a stated goal of decreasing pellet spills, this initiative has provided no public reporting in more than 25 years of existence, according to As You Sow. "The industry's effort to deal with pellet spills, Operation Clean Sweep, provides no transparency on the scope and nature of spills or efforts made to clean up," said Conrad MacKerron, senior vice president of As You Sow in a statement. "Given what we know about the alarming rates of plastic leakage into oceans, companies can no longer hide behind vague pledges of best practices. They need to provide prompt and detailed disclosure about specific actions taken to prevent spills, and when spills occur, information on spill size, and actions taken to clean up." As You Sow last year was involved in successful efforts to push Starbucks to ditch plastic straws and pressure KraftHeinz, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and others to commit to increase the use of recycled packaging in their products. The shareholder proposals will likely be voted on during the spring annual meetings. A Phillips 66 spokesperson said the company has offered to engage with the proponents behind the pellet reporting initiative. A Dow spokesperson said the company "regularly engages with shareholders on sustainability issues and will continue to do so. Dow is committed to innovating and enhancing its products and processes while also collaborating across the plastics value chain to develop solutions that keep plastic out of our environment." Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify that the alliance has committed $1 billion to fighting plastic waste with the goal of reaching $1.5 billion in investments over the next five years.

 By Brian Nearing ALBANY — It will take many years and billions of dollars to fix aging municipal sewer systems that spill sewage into waterways after it rains, state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli warned Thursday. Each year, so-called combined sewer systems (CSOs), which contain both storm water and municipal sewage, are overwhelmed by heavy rains, which causes billions of gallons of untreated sewage and rainwater to spill directly into rivers and streams. Such CSO systems are in place in Albany, Troy, Cohoes, Rensselaer, Watervliet and the village of Green Island. The communities are in the midst of a $147 million rebuilding plan aimed at reducing such spills into the Hudson River by 85 percent. State officials advise that people should avoid coming into contact with river water for several days after a heavy rain. Recent federal studies have estimated it could cost more than $5 billion to fix the CSO systems spread across 46 municipalities in the state, including New York City, Buffalo and Rochester. "The ultimate financial and operational responsibility rests with the local governments that have these systems," wrote DiNapoli. "Local officials must take a long-term approach. ... State and local governments must remain focused on addressing the challenges of aging infrastructure through continued funding for these priorities, thoughtful capital planning and more sustainable development."

 By Brian Nearing Troy An Oregon company has wrapped up a $1 million project to remove and contain pollution at its former Troy steel fabrication plant that has been closed for more than a decade. Esco Corp., of Portland, has excavated some polluted ground from the former Steel Treaters property at 520 Campbell Ave., and installed an underground system to treat what is left in the ground water, according to a notice Friday from the state Department of Environmental Conservation. DEC has issued the company a liability waiver, meaning that Esco is no longer liable for pollution on the property, unless the company fails to maintain the underground treatment system that neutralizes dangerous solvents. There are no drinking water wells at neighboring properties, which are served by Troy's municipal water system. Currently vacant, the 1.1-acre property can now be reused for commercial or industrial purposes under that waiver. The plant was demolished in 2016 after being vacant since being heavily damaged in a 2005 fire. The company also removed about 17 tons of contaminated soil for disposal in a hazardous waste facility. Attempts to reach Esco for comment were not successful. The plant opened in 1966 and used a variety of chlorinated solvents in its manufacturing process. Some four decades of steel fabrication left the ground and groundwater polluted with chemicals including perchloroethylene (PCE, also known as "perc"), a cleaning solvent that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said can cause cancer. PCE and its "breakdown products" have been migrating underground to other properties, according to a DEC notice this summer. Other chemicals include trichloroethene (TCE) and 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE). Prolonged exposure to TCE can damage the liver, kidneys, the immune system, and central nervous system, according to EPA. DCE is also a probable human carcinogen, according to the EPA.

 By Brian Nearing Albany The owner of a shopping plaza on Northern Boulevard will install an underground system to vent off chemical vapors from a former dry cleaners, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. It should cost about $275,000 for the owner of Loudon Plaza, 350 Northern Blvd., to install a system under part of the center to remove potentially dangerous vapors from inside air , according to DEC. The work is being paid for by plaza owner DF Acquisitions LLC. This work is separate from an earlier pollution project by DEC to neutralize an underground plume of cleaning solvent that had spread beneath the property. Vapors are collected in wells and treated before being discharged into the air. Parts of the 3.9-acre property were polluted by a dry-cleaning solvent — tetrachloroethene, a chemical that increases cancer risk — and byproducts trichloroethene, dichloroethene and vinyl chloride. The former Loudon Dry Cleaners and Kem Cleaners operated at the property from 1954 to 1997. Kem Cleaners converted to "drop-off" service only in 1997, according to DEC. The site was added to the state Superfund pollution cleanup program in 2011. DEC has spent about $490,000 to investigate pollution on the property and to control the underground plume. Those costs will be borne by the state since the former dry cleaners has gone bankrupt. Earlier DEC tests found that the plume was not threatening the nearby Memorial Hospital or an apartment complex.

 By Brian Nearing Caption Close ALBANY — The state will be digging out an underground plume of potentially carcinogenic chemicals beneath a former Washington Avenue dry cleaners near several homes routinely rented to college students. Plans by the Department of Environmental Conservation call for a $120,000 cleanup at the former site of RKO Cleaners, at 566 Washington Ave., to deal with unsafe levels of the industrial cleaning solvent tetrachloroethylene (PCE, also known as PERC). The chemical was found in the ground, groundwater and in vapors coming out of the ground. PERC is listed as a potential carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The DEC cleanup plan also calls for the underground injection of chemicals designed to degrade any remaining PERC. Work is expected to start this summer and last about two months as about 180 cubic yards (about 18 dump truck loads) of tainted soil are removed for disposal elsewhere. Parts of the site contain PERC at 100 times the level considered safe for residential use. The property was run as a dry cleaners from 1964 to 2000, when it was destroyed by a fire that caused some drums of cleaning chemicals to leak into the ground. The building was later demolished so tests of the polluted ground could be made, and the site was added to the state Superfund pollution cleanup program in 2013. The work will be paid for by state taxpayers, as the last known owners of the property could not be located, according to DEC. While there are unsafe PERC levels in the ground and groundwater beneath the site, the pollution "does not pose a threat to human health and environment," according to a February 2017 environmental report by consultants Henning, Durham & Richardson. There are residences just to the east of the building, some of which are rented for student housing, and the Abbott Tavern, a popular collegiate nightspot, to the south. The buildings were tested for the presence of potential PERC vapors. Those tests found inside air in those buildings was safe. One building had a system installed to collect any vapors and vent them outside. The property owners, identified on DEC paperwork at Louis Lettsome Sr., of Teaneck, N.J., and Sekyung Jeon, of Hartford, Ct., are currently delinquent on more than $152,000 in city, school and county property taxes, as well as interest and penalties, since 2001, according to Albany County. The county has initiated tax foreclosure proceedings, but has refused to take formal ownership for fear of being stuck with the cleanup bill. "The ultimate goal is to remediate this site for residential use, consistent with current zoning," according to a DEC statement. "After completion of the interim remedial measure, endpoint samples will be collected and groundwater will be monitored to determine if additional remedial measures are required to render the site suitable for residential use."

 By Brian Nearing Caption Close Colonie The state will spend $16.6 million to finish cleaning up PCBs, heavy metals and other pollution from the sprawling former Al Tech Specialty Steel plant at Spring Street Road and Lincoln Avenue. This cleanup, unlike an earlier costly effort that fell short, will be borne by state Superfund program, and ultimately, the taxpayers. Plans call for the removal of more than 1,300 dump truck loads of tainted soil from the plant site and dredged from the Kromma Kill, a stream that flows through the 121-acre property and into the Hudson River, according to an announcement Wednesday from the state Department of Environmental Conservation. This project will come on top of millions of dollars funded and spent by the former plant owners under a 1999 agreement with the state. Since then, that fund has spent about $15.6 million by 2016 on cleanups, including the capping of a 12-acre hazardous waste landfill, according to DEC figures. In January 2016 after testing had found significantly more pollution than initially believed, DEC moved to include the entire 112-acre plant in the state Superfund pollution cleanup program, up from 31 acres that were initially covered under the program starting in 1983. There was about $1 million left in the owners' cleanup fund in May 2016, when the remaining money was transferred to the state "recognizing that the final site remedy would need to be funded by the Superfund program,"according to the DEC cleanup plan. In March 2018, DEC decided to maintain and monitor the capped landfill, after determining that to dig up the site so hazardous material could be disposed up elsewhere could cost more than $138 million. The agency also decided that Superfund would pay about $7.5 million to remove PCB-tainted building structures at the plant for disposal elsewhere. The plant opened in 1910 and at its peak in the 1950s, employed about 5,000 workers. Al Tech filed for bankruptcy protection in 1997 and got a $4.3 million state loan two years later to emerge from bankruptcy. In 1999, DEC and then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced a settlement with plant owners, Chicago-based GATX Corp., to fund a "comprehensive" cleanup of the Colonie plant and another company-owned facility in western New York. At the time, then-DEC Commissioner John Cahill said the settlement would keep Al Tech cleanup costs from being borne by state taxpayers. A new owner, Altx Inc., a subsidiary of Spanish-based Tubacex, closed the Colonie plant in 2002, and it has been vacant since. The property is now owned by Realco Inc., of Windermere, Fla. In November 2017, the town of Colonie Industrial Development Agency announced it would craft potential cleanup and development plans for about 370 acres in and around the former plant. The plant site is the largest piece of the six-parcel Lincoln Avenue Revitalization Plan that is being envisioned by the town for potential use by environmental and technical companies. DEC will hold a public meeting on the Al Tech cleanup plan at 7 p.m. Jan. 22 at the Watervliet Senior Center, 1501 Broadway, Watervliet. DEC is taking public comment on the cleanup plan, which can be publicly examined at the Watervliet Public Library, through Feb. 2 to Project Manager Ruth Curley, NYSDEC, Division of Environmental Remediation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233.

 By Brian Nearing Green Island A pollution cleanup for a planned $60 million project at the site of a former oil tank farm on a Hudson River island will continue until late 2019, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The 8.9-acre vacant property, just south of the Green Island Bridge on what is called Center Island, was once home to King Fuels, which closed in 2008. An oil terminal first started operating there in 1918. The north side of the island is occupied by the Rivers Edge Apartments. Peter Luizzi & Bros. Contracting of Albany wants to build a marina there as part of a mixed-used residential and commercial development called Starbuck Island. Luizzi wants to construct 250 housing units, along with a marina, offices, restaurants and shops.Tests of the site done in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2016 found levels of barium, lead, mercury and other chemicals in the ground and water. Levels of PCBs below the safety standard for residential property were also detected. The Luizzi plan also calls for 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of commercial and retail space, 5,000 to 10,000 square feet of office space, 8,000 to 10,000 square feet of restaurants, and other amenities. Soils there contain excessive levels of arsenic, lead, mercury and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Groundwater also contains excessive levels of PCBs, arsenic, and benzene, according to the DEC report. Luizzi will "perform and pay for the cleanup, which is expected to begin this fall and should take about 14 months to complete," according to a DEC report issued this week. So far this year, DEC has overseen the removal of tons of tainted soil contaminated by fuel oil and other chemicals. Investigations in 2017 found a three-foot-thick layer of liquid petroleum about 25 feet underground. It also found that the site was made up of as much as 28 feet of "historic fill materials including ash, brick, glass and other waste materials." Future continued cleanup plans include: — Removal of underground storage tanks.— Collection and testing of groundwater.— Injection of chemical stabilizers to neutralize contaminated groundwater.— Filling in and covering over remediated areas with clean soil.— Installation of a "cover system" consisting of building foundations, retaining walls, rip-rap, asphalt roads and walkways.— Areas not paved over will be covered with two feet of clean soil in order to meet state safety standards for residential areas.— Installation of vapor intrusion mitigation systems in all on-site buildings.— Creation of a health and safety plan, and a community air monitoring plan as the cleanup continues. DEC is taking comments on the plant from Sept. 5 through Oct. 20. A copy of the plan can be found at the Green Island village offices, 20 Clinton St.

 By Rye Druzin Mothers across the country are trying to call attention to the Trump Administration's efforts to roll back Obama-era methane regulations. The Moms Clean Air Force issued a new report called "Face to face with oil and gas: voices from the front lines of oil and gas pollution," that chronicles the health impacts families living near oil and gas plays across the country say are caused by oil and gas exploration. The report slammed the administration of President Donald Trump for working to loosen pollution regulations related to oil and gas development. It calls out Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's proposal to revise parts of the 2016 Waste Prevention Rule to revert back to the rules in place prior to the current rule. The rule seeks to reduce the waste of natural gas and replaced regulations that were passed in 1979. RELATED: Study says oil and gas industry leaking more methane than previously reported It also takes issue with the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to revisit some parts of the New Source Performance Standards, which would regulate natural gas operations to try to reduce their methane emissions. Misti O'Quinn, who lives in Dallas County near the Barnett Shale, a major natural gas field on North Texas, says two of her three children have suffered with asthma all their lives. She blames the natural gas operations located west of Dallas -- where thousands of natural gas wells were active in 2016 -- for her children's ailments. "It is my hope that this report spurs something that will have our lawmakers looking at keeping safeguards that can get us in attainment and protect our children," O'Quinn said. RELATED: San Antonio's ozone levels determined to be in non-attainment by EPA Dallas and every other major city in Texas currently has higher ozone levels than is permitted, making them out of attainment according to the EPA. Bexar County, which contains much of San Antonio, was recently determined to be in non-attainment by the EPA. Ozone can cause respiratory illnesses. "We are very concerned about what's happening at the federal level as far as health protections for our children and for our families," said Patrice Tomcik, national oil and gas program coordinator for the group. "We want to highlight what is happening across the country and that's why we are bringing forth all of these real life experiences from moms across the nation showing that we do need these health protections." The American Lung Association said 15 of Texas' 254 counties, including all Texas counties with large cities, scored an "F" for ozone pollution. Included in that list of counties is Houston's Harris County, which had 60 ozone warnings days including the only purple alert, the most severe warning that suggests almost everyone should avoid prolonged time outside. Fort Worth's Tarrant County had the second-most ozone warning days with 48 days followed closely by Denton County. San Antonio's Bexar County had the sixth most days of ozone warnings at 24, according to the ALA data from its 2018 State of the Air report. From ExpressNews.com: A natural gas pipeline rupture ruined a South Texas couple's dreams Air quality monitors are located in less than 1,000 of the 3,068 counties in the United States, according to the ALA. Only 34 of Texas' counties have ozone monitoring. Adelita Cantu, an associate professor at University of Texas Health San Antonio's School of Nursing, said she recently visited Karnes County -- an area at the heart of South Texas' Eagle Ford Shale oil and gas field -- and noted that it has far fewer air monitors compared to the Barnett Shale, which is located near Dallas and Fort Worth. "With only having that limited number of monitors it constrains and puts some barriers on how we can monitor the air," Cantu said. A study on methane emissions from U.S. oil and gas operations released in the prestigious journal Science in June said annual methane emission rates from oil and gas operations are 60 percent higher than previously reported by the EPA.

 By Brian Nearing Watervliet A former metal plating plant in Watervliet would be demolished as part of a $1.6 million proposal to control a plume of underground pollution, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The former Perfection Plating building at 911 11th St. would be demolished and the ground beneath it excavated to remove various chemicals and heavy metals, including copper, barium, cadmium, chromium and cyanide. Elevated pollution levels have been found in groundwater both on the site, and in areas near the nearby Watervliet Arsenal and residential areas on 12th Street. The DEC proposal also calls for chemical injections into the ground at the 1.7-acre site to neutralize pollution there and prevent its spread. In 1995, an earlier DEC cleanup included an underground collection trench and treatment plant to clean the polluted groundwater. However, two decades later, the water continues to show "high levels" of chromium, according to DEC. The state Superfund pollution cleanup program paid for the original project and the monitoring since then, and also will pay for the new cleanup plan, according to DEC. Closed since 1990 and now used for storage, the building started metal-plating operations in the mid-1960s as Watervliet Plating, Perfection Plating, and Pinnacle Plating. It is currently owned by Charles Esseian of Latham. Some of the underground pollution stemmed from a leaking chemical storage tank inside the building. As part of the mid-1990s pollution control program, DEC installed underground wells to measure remaining pollution. In 2016, DEC learned that several of those wells had been accidentally deactivated along with other such wells near the Arsenal. New wells were then added to the Perfection Plating site. DEC is taking public comments on it latest proposal at at 7 p.m. March 7 at the Watervliet Senior Center, 1501 Broadway. Written copies of the proposal are available at DEC headquarters, 625 Broadway, Albany.

 By Brian Nearing Caption Close Rotterdam The owners of one of the Capital Region's largest chemical plants have agreed to a $13.8 million pollution control project with the state Department of Environmental Conservation. SI Group, which has made chemical resins at its Main Street plant since the 1950s, will deal with various underground pollution plumes by digging up the most-polluted areas, stabilizing and paving over other tainted ground, and installing systems to capture hazardous underground vapors that could leak into the air. The company also agreed to provide a $15.4 million "financial assurance" to deal with remaining pollution should the decades-old plant ever close. The guarantee could be used to pay for a more complete pollution cleanup of the site by DEC, should SI Group be unable or unwilling to conduct it. SI Group, formerly Schenectady International, employs about 200 people at its Rotterdam factory and another 200 at its headquarters and laboratory in Niskayuna. It has 20 factories around the world. SI factories make resins used in 80 percent of the automobile tires made throughout the world, and many of its chemicals are used as raw materials to make products ranging from inks to fuel additives and plastics. Reached in August, the the pollution agreement with DEC is part of renewal of a 1998 permit that SI needs to handle and store hazardous waste. The cleanup agreement covers about half of the 21-acre site at its eastern side, including about two-thirds of the chemical manufacturing facilities. Work on the site, including excavation and removal of tainted soil, as well as injection of stabilizing chemicals and installation of vapor venting and a collection system, could take about two years, according to the DEC. Some of the pollution involved include volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, including benzene, a known human carcinogen, as well as toluene, styrene and xylene. Earlier pollution control efforts, which included an underground barrier built in the 1990s around the northern edge of the plant to contain pollution from leaking into the nearby Mohawk River, are working, according to an August report by DEC. "Contaminated groundwater ... is being contained" by the underground barrier, according to the DEC report. "The aquifer for the area is heavily used by both municipal supply wells andprivate wells ... Private and public water supply wells have been sampled and no site-related contamination has been detected." DEC added Tuesday that the underground barrier "successfully prevents any groundwater contamination from migrating from the site to the Mohawk River, and a groundwater extraction system lowers the groundwater table on the inside of the barrier wall, away from the river." An SI Group spokeswoman said the company has invested more than $71 million over the past 20 years in environmental initiatives at Rotterdam Junction. "Last summer, we completed a project to remove an area of historical contamination of soil at the site at a cost of approximately $400,000," spokeswoman Tara Morgan said. "SI Group is committed to environmental stewardship and full compliance with all applicable requirements and emissions limits." In October, SI Group was sold to the private equity firm SK Capital Partners. The company had a significant history of environmental violations with DEC. In 2014, SI Group was hit with a $400,000 pollution fine for a host of violations, marking the fifth such instance in less than four years. In four earlier DEC agreements since March 2011, SI Group paid a total of about $275,000 in fines against the Rotterdam plant for air and water pollution violations. Prior to being purchased by SI Group, the Rotterdam property was a rail yard owned by the Boston & Maine Railroad Co.

It also found that the site was made up of as much as 28 feet of "historic fill materials including ash, brick, glass and other waste materials." The plan calls for removal of the underground petroleum layer and of "grossly contaminated materials" on top of it that would be taken elsewhere for disposal. New fill would be brought in to restore the site. Work could start next spring, according to DEC. About 4,000 tons of contaminated soil would be removed. A copy of the proposal is filed at the village of Green Island offices, at 20 Clinton St., Green Island. Luizzi wants to construct 250 housing units, along with a marina, offices, restaurants and shops. Tests of the site done in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2016 found levels of barium, lead, mercury and other chemicals in the ground and water. Levels of PCBs below the safety standard for residential property were also detected. The Luizzi plan also calls for 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of commercial and retail space, 5,000 to 10,000 square feet of office space, and 8,000 to 10,000 square feet of restaurants, as well as a community clubhouse, pool, marina, fishing pier, recreational facilities and walking trails.

 Dan Freedman WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency doubled down on its ban of reporters at its chemical-pollution summit, barring reporters for the second day in a row as questions about the agency’s commitment to controlling dangerous chemicals continued to percolate. According to Politico reporters for CNN and two environmental publications were barred from the second day of the meeting billed as the “National Leadership Summit to take action on PFAS” — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. On Tuesday, EPA officials initially permitted coverage only of an hour’s worth of the opening, including brief remarks by controversial EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Guards physically ejected an Associated Press reporter who sought out a EPA public affairs officer to register protest over closure of the meeting. The Times Union had been invited to attend the meeting’s opening session. “We know PFAS is a concern to many of your readers,” an EPA spokeswoman said, a reference to the presence of PFAS in the water of Hoosick Falls in Rensselaer County. The pollution stemmed from long-neglected industrial sites leaking chemicals into ground water. For scheduling reasons, the Times Union decided to cover the event via Livestream, which was cut off after the first hour. Reporters from CNN and AP were denied entrance to the session, which sparked an outcry that diverted focus away from EPA’s message of concern over PFAS chemicals. The decision later Tuesday to permit coverage of afternoon events did little to quell the brouhaha. “If sunlight is the best disinfectant, then the darkness of exclusion and secrecy — like that practiced by Mr. Pruitt — is the best catalyst for rot,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer on Wednesday. An EPA official quoted by Politico justified exclusion of the press Wednesday, saying "both state and federal officials had the expectation that the second day of the summit would be a government-to-government discussion between federal and state co-regulators who are working together to address this important issue.” The summit was aimed at thwarting negative fallout over reports that the White House had labeled a Department of Health and Human Services report on PFAS a “public relations nightmare.” The EPA and White House blocked the report, evoking outcries from political figures including Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Gillibrand termed the failure to release the report “outrageous.” “Numerous communities in New York have already had their water supplies poisoned by these chemicals, and if the Trump administration has more evidence that PFAS are harmful to people’s health, then they need to come clean and tell the public,” Gillibrand said last week. “No New Yorker should ever have to fear that their drinking water is going to make them sick, and New Yorkers deserve to see the results of this study immediately.” On Wednesday, Rep. John Faso, R-Kinderhook, fired yet another salvo over release of the report. PFAS have been linked to “possible health complications from exposure including cancer, fertility issues, and slowed learning in children,” Faso said in a letter Wednesday to Pruitt. “Communities in my district like Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh have seen these early reports and continue to suffer the long-term impacts of this water contamination. Residents in upstate New York are looking for as much information as possible so they can make well informed decisions for their families.”

 By Brian Nearing Schenectady The state is giving a Schenectady chemical manufacturer a clean bill of health for dealing with underground pollution at its original factory, some two decades after ordering the company to confront the toxins. In March, the state Department of Environmental Conservation issued what is called a "certificate of completion" to SI Group Inc., for its former plant on Tenth Street where numerous chemicals leaked into the ground for decades until the company ceased operations there in 1997. Announced by DEC this week, that certificate absolves SI for any remaining contamination "coming at or from the site." The fenced-in, five-acre property can now be reused for industrial or commercial purposes, but no residences can ever be built there. This comes more than 20 years after DEC first moved against against the company in 1997, which at the time was known as Schenectady International. DEC said Thursday that the timeframe is not unusual. DEC has been "overseeing this complex cleanup project, which included multiple cleanup phases to ensure the protection of the public and the environment." The cleanup "involved building demolition of the entire site to determine the full nature and extent of contamination," according to the DEC statement. SI started demolishing the factory in 2004 and finished in 2011. Also, the project "required relatively new technology and extensive pilot testing of that technology to ensure it would be successful at this site prior to remedy selection and full site implementation," according to DEC. SI spokeswoman Tara Morgan said there were several reasons for the timeframe, including: — Because this was an active site up until the late 1990s, some areas were not accessible. — A remedy to prevent offsite migration of contaminants has been in place and active since 2002. — Investigations were required in order to identify an effective remedy for onsite contamination. — SI could not begin work until after DEC has approved the design. The Tenth Street plant opened in 1908 in the Hungry Hill neighborhood as the Schenectady Varnish Works, the predecessor of Schenectady International. The factory made electrical insulation materials for General Electric and other companies. Neighbors there had long complained of odors, respiratory problems, strange colors in nearby Cowhorn Creek, and clusters of suspicious illnesses. In 1997, after years of pollution violations, DEC moved against SI. The two sides signed an agreement (called a consent order) that would require the company to confront pollution at the Hungry Hill facility, as well as at other SI sites in Niskayuna, Rotterdam Junction, and Broadway. Under that agreement, the company agreed to phase out chemical production at the Tenth Street site. In 1997, DEC also imposed a $1.5 million fine on SI and ordered the company to pay another $200,000 to Schenectady County to support emergency responder services. At the now-vacant factory site, systems to extract and treat toxic vapors and polluted water from the ground have been installed. Toxins include benzene, a known human carcinogen, as well as xylene, ethylbenzene, phenols, toluene and acetone. Polluted groundwater is being diverted to underground wells for collection and treatment. Polluted ground has been paved over to keep rainwater from getting into the ground and passing though remaining toxins. In 1997, DEC officials estimated that work would cost $3.7 million and take several years, according to a report in the Times Union at the time. It could not immediately be determined how much the cleanup ultimately cost. Initially, DEC sought $8 million in penalties against SI and seek repayment of $500,000 of state expenses in pursuing the company, which prompted SI to threaten to move out of the area, according to a 1991 report in the Times Union. The company's main plant remains in Rotterdam Junction.

 By Brian Nearing Bethlehem Owners of a scrap metal and electronics recycling yard will take steps to reduce levels of toxic mercury spilling into the Hudson as part of a new state pollution permit recently issued by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. DEC this month issued the new permit to owners of Sims Metal Management, which operates at 140 Port Road South as Port of Albany Ventures. The property is just south of the Port of Albany. The new permit also adds two drain pipes at the facility that were not part of the earlier permit, which expired in 2009. DEC had been negotiating with the facility's owners since to come up with a new permit since the earlier permit expired in 2007; during the negotiations, that permit remained in effect under the state Administrative Procedures Act. Two of the drainage pipes at the Sims facility empty into the Hudson, while the third pipe drains in the Normanskill, a tributary of the Hudson. In 2008, test found one of those pipes was discharging rainwater that contained mercury at 1,100 parts per trillion, well beyond the state limit of 50 parts per trillion. Subsequent tests have found mercury emissions below that limit. In the new pollution permit, the owners agree to follow a "mercury minimization program" to bring down mercury levels further. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin and is especially dangerous for children and fetuses. Most human exposure to water-borne mercury comes from eating fish contaminated with mercury. Also, the owners agreed to take further precautions to reduce drainage around road salt piles kept on the site, which apparently were a source of cyanide getting into drainage water and into the river. The company also will monitor its drainage for chemicals including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. Sims is one of the world's largest metals and electronics recyclers, and runs a scrap metal and electronics recycling operation at the Bethlehem facility. Electronics can contain various components with mercury. At its Bethlehem yard, the company buys and shreds "ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal, stainless and electronics," according to the Sims website. Materials are then shipped away by barge for use in manufacturing. A Sims affiliate, Port Albany Ventures LLC, took over the state water pollution permit when it acquired the site in 2005. Based in New York City, Sims runs more than 130 recycling yards in North America, along with nearly 100 more in Australia and Europe.

 By Fernando Ramirez The phrase "don't mess with Texas" rings hollow when it doesn't apply to some of the state's worst polluters: major industries. A new study by watchdog advocacy group Environment Texas says Lone Star State companies are the biggest offenders in the nation when it comes to releasing pollution into our waterways. In 938 instances, Texas companies released pollution that exceeded the levels permitted by federal clean water laws, according to researchers who examined Texas Commission for Environmental Quality data. TOO LITTLE SMOG: EPA to ease back emissions standards "Over a 21-month period from January 2016 to September 2017, major industrial facilities released pollution that exceeded the levels allowed under their Clean Water Act permits more than 8,100 times," explained the study. "Often, these polluters faced no fines or penalties." Of the 8,100 pollution cases, roughly 12 percent were from major industrial facilities in Texas. Earlier this year, a separate study by Environmental Working Group found that Texas has the most radiated drinking water in the country.

 By Amanda Fries ALBANY — Wanting to reduce air pollution in the South End, Albany County Legislator Samuel Fein is looking to require that all permanent petroleum tanks be painted white. Dark-colored storage tanks absorb more heat, resulting in greater emissions from the tanks that must be vented. Fein said have all tanks in Albany County white would help reduce overall emissions. “Every little bit matters,” he said Wednesday. “There are so many different contributors for all the pollution that people are breathing in there. I’m trying to take action where we have the authority to take action in the county.” The law would only apply to permanent petroleum storage tanks in the county, most of which are in the South End and Port of Albany. Federal regulations prevent localities from pursuing requirements on tankers transporting petroleum by train. Local Law “J” would require owners and operators of both new and existing petroleum storage tanks to keep the exterior of the tanks painted white. A logo or written text not exceeding five percent of the exterior surface area of the tank would be allowed. Violating the law would subject owners and operators to a penalty of up to $1,000 for each day. Fein said four tanks in Albany County are currently not painted white. The tanks are owned by Global Partners. The company said it plans to discuss the proposed legislation with the community, the county and the state Department of Environmental Conservation. "When we purchased the terminal in 2007, we repainted a number of tanks as part of Global's routine maintenance program. Currently we paint tanks either white or blue, and most tanks in Albany are white," the company said in an emailed statement. "We haven't heard before that the tank color was a concern for the community. We are interested in hearing more from the community, and doing what we can to address their concerns." Chris Amato, an attorney with Earthjustice who has been representing South End residents in their fight against polluting oil tank operations, applauded Fein’s step to reduce emissions. “Dark-colored tanks emit more pollutants, especially during the warmer months,” he said in a news release. “This is a simple and much-needed step to allow families in Albany County to breathe cleaner air.” Concerns about the health impacts of living in a heavy industrial zone surrounded by petroleum storage tanks, idling freight trains and rumbling diesel-powered trucks have long been expressed by South End residents and community advocates, and have gained the attention of local, state and federal officials. The Department of Environmental Conservation is investing $500,000 to study pollution in the neighborhood as well as a truck traffic survey on South Pearl led by the city and the Capital District Transportation Committee.

 By Alex Stuckey University of Texas-Austin researchers have found that air pollution shortens human lives globally by more than one year -- an alarming fact as Saturday marks the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Harvey's landfall, which caused thousands of pounds of toxic fumes to spew from refineries and chemical plants. "The fact that fine particle air pollution is a major global killer is already well known," said Joshua Apte, a UT-Austin assistant professor. "Here, we were able to systematically identify how air pollution also substantially shortens lives around the world. What we found is that air pollution has a very large effect on survival." The study, published Wednesday in Environmental Science & Technology Letters, examined outdoor air pollution in 185 countries. They chose to focus on fine particle air pollution because it can easily enter the lungs and increases the risk of respiratory diseases, cancer and heart attacks. This kind of pollution typically comes from power plants, industrial emissions, fires and motor vehicles, the study stated. The study was funded by the Center for Air, Climate, and Energy Solutions, a research collaboration supported by the Environmental Protection Agency. Apte in a statement said the discovery is important, but context is everything. "A body count saying 90,000 Americans or 1.1 million Indians die per year from air pollution is large but faceless," he said. "Saying that, on average, a population lives a year less than they would have otherwise — that is something relatable." The study's publication comes just a week after the Environmental Integrity Project, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, released a report chronicles the amount of air and water pollution caused by Harvey and how state, local and industry officials can better prepare for the next big storm. SPEWING TOXIC FUMES: Hurricane Harvey-caused water and air pollution likely far higher than residents realize The report found that at least 6.6 million pounds of air pollution and 150 million gallons of sewage and industrial discharge were released during the storm. Questions remain about just how much air and water pollution truly was released in the aftermath of Harvey — and how much of it could or should have been avoided by better planning, maintenance and procedures. SILENT SPILLS, PART 1: In Houston and beyond, Harvey's spills leave a toxic legacy The project's findings confirm reporting by the Houston Chronicle and the Associated Press published in a series, called "Silent Spills," earlier this year on the government's inaction following more than 100 toxic spills on land, in water and in the air during and after Harvey. This, despite the fact that documents show benzene, vinyl chloride, butadiene and other known human carcinogens were among the dozens of tons of industrial chemicals released throughout Houston's petrochemical corridor and surrounding neighborhoods and waterways.

 By Alex Stuckey As the rainfall inched higher during Hurricane Harvey last year, so, too, did the amount of toxic fumes that industrial facilities across the state reported releasing — until it breached 8.3 million pounds of unpermitted air pollution. But companies later reduced those estimates by 1.7 million pounds, a steep drop that environmental experts say could have been prompted by Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to suspend Texas' environmental reporting rules for months after Harvey. It calls into question if the waiver "encouraged companies to downgrade or eliminate their pollution reporting after the fact," according to a report released Thursday by the Environmental Integrity Project, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. "Such activity undermines public trust in our regulatory systems and may mask real health risks posed by air pollution releases during storms." The changing estimates underscore questions about just how much air and water pollution was truly released in the aftermath of Harvey — and how much of it could or should have been avoided by better planning, maintenance and procedures. The report chronicles the amount of air and water pollution caused by Harvey and how state, local and industry officials can better prepare for the next big storm. For example, the organization found that industries in the Houston area waited more than three days after Abbott declared a "state of disaster" on Aug. 23 to shut down their plants, leading to more significant air pollution releases, on average, here than in Corpus Christi — another major center for refineries that was hit by the storm before Houston. The report also found that Harvey-related water pollution was vastly underestimated. In all, industrial and municipal plants reported that more than 150 million gallons of sewage and industrial discharge spilled across the Texas coastline due to Harvey — but at least 24 percent of facilities that reported spills provided no estimates of the overflows, listing them only as "zero." Andrea Morrow, spokeswoman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said in a statement that the agency does not comment on other organizations' reports, but that "we vigorously defend our practices." SILENT SPILLS, PART 1: In Houston and beyond Harvey's spills leave a toxic legacy The Environmental Integrity Project's findings confirm reporting by the Houston Chronicle and the Associated Press published in a series earlier this year on the government's inaction following more than 100 toxic spills on land, in water and in the air during and after Harvey. This, despite the fact that documents show benzene, vinyl chloride, butadiene and other known human carcinogens were among the dozens of tons of industrial chemicals released throughout Houston's petrochemical corridor and surrounding neighborhoods and waterways. The project recommended that TCEQ should, in the future, draft less ambiguous permits, as well as avoid suspending pollution reporting requirements. Both wastewater treatment plants and industrial plants should be better prepared for natural disasters like Harvey in the future. SILENT SPILLS, PART 2: For Crosby residents, a 'bitter taste' about Arkema and little help from government "While some pollution may be unavoidable during major storms, improvements like coordinated shutdowns of plants ... could help improve the responses next time there's a major storm," Ilan Levin, the project's Texas director, said Thursday during a conference call. And there will be a next time, said Ron Sass, a climate expert with emeritus status at Rice University. Climate change is making storms more intense, Sass said Thursday. "The time is here for all of us to put aside the old normal ... and deliver creative and effective policy to change and meet the new normal of our affected climate." Conflicting reports Workers at the Flint Hills Resources plant in Port Arthur were in the beginning phases of a planned shutdown on Aug. 29 when a loss of steam forced an emergency shutdown of their Light Olefins Unit. The company produces ethylene and propylene (both light olefins), which is used to manufacture parts for medical devices. The emergency shutdown caused a release of air pollution initially estimated at 533,200 pounds, project data shows. But in the company's final report to TCEQ, that number was cut to 33,490 pounds, an erasure of almost 500,000 pounds. The reason for such a drastic change is unclear. The company did not respond to a request for comment. MORE POLLUTION: After Harvey, a second storm of air pollution, state reports The project found 17 other examples of similar changes — an erasure of 1.7 million pounds of air pollution in total — by examining air emission reports from during and after Harvey at two different times, first in October 2017 and again in June 2018. Also in Port Arthur, the Chevron Phillips Chemical facility completely removed its initially reported 34,591 pounds of emissions, saying the pollution was authorized under its permit, the report found. In a statement Thursday, Chevron Phillips said it began shutting down in preparation for Harvey — alerting officials and providing an estimated emissions amount — but ultimately determined that a complete shutdown wasn't necessary. "Once it was apparent that the emissions would be within the allowable limit of the permit for a shut-down, the notice to the TCEQ was rescinded," the statement says. The state authorizes emissions for planned maintenance, startup and shutdown activities. But unplanned activities, like those that happen during a natural disaster, are not authorized and the limit for these events, effectively, is zero, the report states. MONITORING PLANTS: Government ill-equipped to monitor industrial plants damaged by Hurricane Harvey This suggests that the state is drafting permits that are too broad, the report says, and that Harvey-related releases are being mischaracterized "to hide the unauthorized emissions." Morrow, the TCEQ spokeswoman, said in the statement that "any emissions resulting from emergency or unplanned events would not be included in a permit." Within 24 hours of discovering an emissions event, she added, companies must file an initial report that contains emissions estimates, usually based on experience or engineering calculations. Those initial estimates can be revised in the final report — due two weeks after the event ends — which is then investigated by the TCEQ, she added. A disaster declaration On Aug. 28, three days after Harvey began pummeling the Houston area, Abbott suspended environmental reporting and record-keeping rules relating to air pollution, wastewater and fuel standards for vehicles, as well as liability for unauthorized emissions for the duration of the disaster declaration. He did not lift the suspension until April, just a few weeks after the Chronicle and the Associated Press published their series. Environmental experts believe this suspension also is partly to blame for the altered reports. SEVEN MONTHS LATER: Abbott lifts post-Harvey suspension of environmental regulations In its report, the project noted that this suspension likely led to an underestimation of Harvey-related air pollution. No one knows how many industrial plant operators opted out of reporting emissions because of this suspension, the report continued, and it led to "widespread confusion" because many companies still had to report their emissions to the federal government. Therefore, the report recommends that pollution reporting should not be suspended during major storms in the future. It also suggests that the state should bar plants from retracting pollution reports because of "disaster declarations or questionable interpretations of the state permits." But Morrow said companies had to comply with the reporting rules "at the earliest opportunity available," adding that companies claiming Harvey caused a "situation of noncompliance" have to demonstrate — with documentation — that they were unable to take the necessary actions to cope with the hurricane because of those requirements. "The TCEQ is and will continue to conduct investigations of Hurricane Harvey related incidents, including emissions events," she said. Spewing sewage The 150 million gallons of sewage and industrial discharges that spewed into local communities and waterways as a result of Harvey shocked residents and environmental experts alike. But the project found that the amount reported likely is low. ONE COMPANY, 100 MILLION GALLONS: Port Arthur plant had largest wastewater spill in Texas after Harvey Of the 691 sewage and industrial discharge spills reported to the state, about 24 percent reported releasing zero gallons. It's unlikely, however, that these facilities released nothing, the report stated. For example, Dow's Deer Park chemical plant near Houston reported releasing zero gallons, but the description of the incident states that 103.6 million pounds of non-hazardous biosolids and 17.4 million pounds overflowed from its treatment plants. It's also not clear what contaminants were released in many of these spills, the report found. $1 MILLION IN DAMAGES: 3 wastewater treatment plants offline because of Harvey. The project suggests TCEQ develop a better way to quickly assess dangerous chemicals discharged during floods and then communicate those risks to the public in a timely manner. It also suggests that these facilities be better prepared for future storms, which could include building better barriers or levees or moving the plants to higher ground. Morrow said that TCEQ "actively works to monitor" facilities that have reported spills, as well as provide guidance on how to handle these events. The facilities were prepared, she added, but "the magnitude and the nature of the record-setting flooding from Hurricane Harvey impacted facilities in a way that they could not respond to operationally."

 Hoosick Falls A longtime Hoosick Falls company that is pulling out the small village after decades there has been ordered by the state to check its plants for pollution that might be left behind. During the last month, the state Department of Environmental Conservation has ordered both Oak-Mitsui Inc. and its landlord to look into a former Oak plant that closed two years ago, as well as another that will close in January. "As part of the state's ongoing efforts to address contamination in the Hoosick Falls area, DEC continues to investigate contamination potentially emanating from former Oak Mitsui facilities," said DEC spokeswoman Erica Ringewald. "Any change in ownership or management of the site does not preclude Oak Mitsui's responsibility to address contamination if the company is found liable," she added. Oak has operated in the small Rensselaer County village since the 1970s. For more than two decades, it made copper and aluminum foils for smartphones and other electronics. Both facilities to be studied, one on Mechanic Street and another on First Street, are on the Hoosic River. Results will help DEC decide whether to add the properties to the state Superfund pollution cleanup program. The Mechanic Street facility had been leased by Oak from former owner Honeywell International Inc., and will close Jan. 2, taking with it 20 jobs. Part of the property remains privately owned, with the rest owned by Rensselaer County. Oak recently sold its business to a California-based competitor, which is consolidating its manufacturing there. Oak's former First Street site, which closed in 2015, is still owned by Oak-Mitsui Inc. Buildings on the 7.4-acre site have since been demolished. On Thursday, Honeywell signed an agreement with DEC agreeing to examine the 5.3-acre Mechanic Street site and "off-site areas" for pollution, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a toxic chemical used to create non-stick surfaces. After the village drinking water supply was found to be tainted with PFOA in 2015, the state reached similar consent orders with Honeywell and another company linked to the problem — Saint Gobain Performance Plastics. "Honeywell is conducting the environmental investigation under the state's supervision and direction," said Honeywell spokeswoman Victoria Streitfeld. "We are cooperating with the property owner." Oak-Mitsui signed a similar DEC agreement in early September to examine its former First Street plant for PFOA and other potential pollution. The company did not use PFOA in its manufacturing process. The company also agreed to turn over records to DEC on plant operations, including how hazardous waste was handled. The company also must tell DEC which employees were responsible for hazardous waste disposal and include "the dates of such disposal." Honeywell had an earlier agreement DEC in June 2016 to examine a former 11-acre facility on River Road, which operated from the 1960s through 2000 with a "succession of parties, including Oak Materials Group of Oak Industries, and Allied Signal," according to DEC records. A former landfill on the site was removed under a state order in 1987. Ringwald said Oak-Mitsui conducted an environmental study on this property in 2016 and 2017. So far, she said, work includes "samples of soil both on the property and on adjacent property, groundwater samples on the property and on adjacent property and surface water." Attempts Friday to reach officials at Oak-Mitsui for comment were not successful.

 By Brian Nearing Troy An Oregon company is spending about $1 million to contain pollution at its former Troy steel fabrication plant that has been closed for more than a decade. Esco Corp., of Portland, has proposed the plan for its former Steel Treaters property at 520 Campbell Ave., according to a notice this week by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Attempts to contact Esco, a maker of mining and construction products, for comment Thursday weren't successful. But according to the DEC notice, the company is proposing to build a containment system to keep underground pollution on the property from further spreading to adjoining properties. Work on the site could begin by September, according to DEC. The property has been vacant since the plant was demolished after being damaged in a 2005 fire. The plant opened in 1966 and used a variety of chlorinated solvents in its manufacturing process. Some four decades of steel fabrication left the ground and groundwater polluted with chemicals including perchloroethylene (PCE, also known as "perc"), a cleaning solvent that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said can cause cancer. PCE and its "breakdown products ... are migrating off-site," according to the DEC notice. Other chemicals include trichloroethene (TCE) and 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE). Prolonged exposure to TCE can damage the liver, kidneys, immune system, and central nervous system, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. DCE is a probable human carcinogen, according to the EPA. Esco plans to install an underground barrier to contain pollution from spreading any farther. The 1.1-acre property would also be capped with clean materials to allow for potential "commercial or industrial use." The company will also test whether chemical vapors are leaking out of the ground around the building, to decide whether an air depressurization system is needed, according to DEC.

 By Kenneth C. Crowe II TROY – Nassau Supervisor David Fleming spoke strongly in support of a Rensselaer County law to protect groundwater from a suspected carcinogen around the Dewey Loeffel Landfill Superfund Site on Wednesday at County Executive Steven McLaughlin’s first public meeting. McLaughlin, who took office Monday, signed the law setting a limit of 0.35 parts per billion for 1,4-dioxane, the suspected carcinogen, and filling a gap in controlling discharges into local waterways at the conclusion of the public hearing. Fleming has joined other town officials in fighting pollution problems at the landfill. Dewey Loeffel was named a federal Superfund site in 2011. From 1952 until 1968, an estimated 46,000 tons of toxic industrial was were dumped in the landfill. Fleming said 1,000 acres is contaminated by the plume from the spread of the contaminated materials. “It hurts families in my community. It hurts economic development in the town of Nassau. It hurts economic development in Rensselaer County,” said Fleming, who just started his sixth term as Nassau town supervisor. County Legislator Bob Loveridge, R-Schodack, also spoke in support of the local law. The County Legislature approved the law in December, sending it to the county executive to sign. The law requires at least weekly testing for 1,4-dioxane; establishes a fine of $1,000 each time the limit is violated by the wastewater plant; and sets the limit of 0.35 parts per billion of the chemical. In the past, officials said there have been readings as high as 9 parts per billion of 1,4 dioxane flowing out of the site. “We’re going to do whatever we can to protect our residents,” McLaughlin said shortly before signing the law. Public safety issues are among the first tasks McLaughlin is addressing in the opening days of his administration. The county executive said he is working to fill the vacancies for director of public safety and supervising the county STOP-DWI Program. McLaughlin said he plans to name an “Opioid Czar” to battle problems with heroin and other opioids that are leading to addiction and deaths. McLaughlin said he plans to work with Albany County Executive Dan McCoy and leaders of other counties in confronting the crisis. Rensselaer County also will complete work on its new emergency communications system and a new fire tower, he said.

 By Alex Stuckey A group of environmentalists started the 2018 hurricane season by demanding Gov. Greg Abbott improve how the state protects its residents from air pollution during major storms like Harvey. "Harmful air pollution was one of the unseen dangers of Hurricane Harvey," said a letter to Abbott from One Breath Partnership, a group that focuses on improving air quality in Houston, released Friday. "Texas can and must reduce our communities' exposure to these pollutants." The letter was posted on Care2 Petition, an online petition site, at least nine days ago. As of Friday afternoon, it had garnered nearly 23,000 signatures -- 3,500 of which were from Texans. The petition and letter come just a few months after the Houston Chronicle and the Associated Press published a series of stories on the government's inaction following more than 100 toxic spills on land, in water and air during and after Harvey, even though documents show that benzene, vinyl chloride, butadiene and other known human carcinogens were among the dozens of tons of industrial chemicals released throughout Houston's petrochemical corridor and surrounding neighborhoods and waterways. The news organizations found that only a handful of the industrial spills had been investigated by federal regulators and Texas regulators say they have investigated 89 incidents statewide. Testing by state and federal regulators of soil and water for contaminants largely was limited to Superfund toxic waste sites. Among other things, the letter calls on the governor to restore chemical right-to-know standards so that first responders and area residents know what they might be exposed to, as well as ensure that the Texas State Commission on Environmental Quality is capable of responding to pollution events.

 By Alex Stuckey Air pollution in the Houston and Galveston areas could more than double if eligible companies take advantage of an air emissions "loophole" created by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt earlier this year, a new report finds. In January, Pruitt reversed a 1995 policy known as "once in, always in," under which all "major" air polluters, such as power plants and factories, would always be regulated under stricter standards even if they reduced pollution. Pruitt's decision would allow them to get out from under those stricter standards once their pollution fell within the legal limits, a move that was billed by the EPA at the time as "reducing regulatory burdens." In the Houston/Galveston area, 18 facilities fit that bill — a fact that could prove disastrous for the area's air, according to a report released Tuesday by the Environmental Defense Fund. "The results of our Houston analysis underscores just how reckless Pruitt's decision to create an air toxics loophole will be for the city's residents and for Americans that live near industrial facilities all across the country," said Tomás Carbonell, the organization's director of regulatory policy. "Administrator Pruitt's decision to plow ahead despite expert warnings of significant pollution increases, and with no public input and no analysis of health impacts, is unconscionable." EPA officials did not immediately provide a comment. The Chronicle reached out to 10 of the companies Tuesday afternoon but did not hear back. Those 18 facilities — which include the Huntsman Petrochemical Plant in Conroe as well as Geon-Oxy Vinyl and the Equistar Chemicals Complex in La Porte — emitted about 183 tons of hazardous air pollutants in 2014, the most recent year available, the report found. If all the facilities use the "loophole" to the maximum extent possible, that amount increases 146 percent, to a total of 450 tons, the report continues. The organization, however, has no information to suggest that these 18 facilities, which emit hazardous air pollutants such as hydrochloric acid, lead, mercury and benzene, will take advantage of the loophole. That makes much of this report theoretical, said Adrian Shelley, director of Public Citizen's Texas office, though no less useful. "There's some logical leaps in there. It's not necessarily the case that every company will do that ... [and] the impact of this rule change on public health is unknowable at this point," he said. "That being said, their analysis about the vulnerability of the area is spot on." The organization compiled its list by examining facility-level data from the EPA's Enforcement and Compliance History Online database, the most recent National Emissions Inventory from 2014, and from federal operating permits. Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said there's a risk that companies will use Pruitt's actions to increase air pollution, which would be dangerous for Texans' health. "This is a backdoor attempt to let polluters off the hook from having to use the best technology to reduce their emissions," Metzger said, calling it "a cynical handout from an ethically compromised EPA administrator." Nationwide, the loophole could impact 2,617 facilities, according to the report. "This analysis underscores the recklessness of Scott Pruitt's EPA in upending a policy that had been in place for nearly a quarter-century without undertaking any analysis of the public health consequences for families and communities affected by this decision," the report states. The organization's report can be found here. The 18 facilities identified by the organization are: Alex Stuckey covers science and the environment for the Houston Chronicle.

 LCS Staff All my life, I’ve been a good citizen. I vote. I volunteer. I know my neighbors. Moreover, I take care of my property. I garden. I make jams and jellies to give away for Christmas. In short, I fulfill my obligations as a rural homeowner. Still, there’s one additional step I’ve taken to be a good neighbor: I’ve signed a pledge to resist fracking in New York State. I moved with my family to the small city of Ithaca in upstate New York five years ago. We were drawn to the natural beauty here and the innovative local economy, which has one of the fastest growing organic and family farming sectors in the country. Here in Ithaca, crop mobs — large groups of volunteers — show up at local farms to plant and harvest alongside our hardest working neighbors: the farmers. A network is growing, too, to provide low-income residents with access to locally grown, healthy, organic produce. We’re on the cutting edge of a new economy: one that uses renewable energy, leaves a small carbon footprint, and invests in local businesses. This emerging economy is more livable and prosperous than older models, which are failing everywhere. Fracking threatens all of this. Fracking, or “hydraulic fracturing,” is a controversial method used in drilling for oil and gas. It turns rural communities into industrial zones, complete with all the problems that come with heavy industry: blazing flares, loud noise, light pollution, heavy truck traffic, and air and water contamination. Although you might not choose to buy property next to an industrial waste site, if your neighbor wants to frack, you’re out of luck. Residents living near fracking sites complain of a wide range health problems related to pollution of their property — from nosebleeds to asthma, cancer, and kidney disease. To make matters worse, gas companies and lawmakers have teamed up in states like Pennsylvania to pass gag rules that block doctors and nurses from discussing the health effects of fracking-related chemical exposures with their patients. A recent study published in the peer-reviewed Environmental Health journal shows that not only does fracking pollute water sources — more than 687 million gallons of fracking waste laden with radioactive materials and heavy metals were injected in deep wells in Ohio alone last year — it also threatens our air quality. The study of six communities in Arkansas, Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Wyoming found high levels of air pollution at multiple fracking and oil production and storage sites. More than one third of study air samples contained concentrations of dangerous chemicals exceeding federal standards for health and safety. Among the chemicals that most often exceeded limits, the study found formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen, and hydrogen sulfide, a potent nerve and organ toxin that smells like rotten eggs. In Wyoming, the air sample contained hydrogen sulfide in concentrations ranging from twice to 660 times the level classified by the EPA as immediately dangerous to human life.

 By Brian Nearing ALBANY — A business group blamed bloated bureaucracy for fueling chronic budget deficits in an air pollution control program, rather than inadequate fees charged by the state on polluting industries. Darren Suarez, government affairs director for the Business Council of New York, said Friday that state Department of Environmental Conservation needs to leave fees alone and cut more costs out of air pollution control and permitting. "DEC and the agencies should be commended for reducing some of the program cost, but unfortunately this administration inherited a truly overly bloated program from the Gov. (Eliot) Spitzer administration," Suarez said. DEC defended the program, pointing out that industry fees that support state efforts are declining because air pollution emissions are dropping. Still, that has left chronic deficits. For this year, DEC is projecting it will collect about $6.4 million in fees on a program that will cost $15.8 million to run -- for a deficit of more than $9 million. That would come on top of an $8.3 million deficit in 2016, a $10.4 million deficit in 2015, a $9 million deficit in 2014 and a $6.7 million deficit in 2013, according to DEC. Although the federal Clean Air Act requires that polluting industries must financially support expenses for the state air pollution inspection and permitting programs, ongoing deficits have been covered by state taxpayers through the general fund. In 2008 and 2009, the state Legislature provided $9 million to bail out the program. While program expenses have declined in recent years, that decline has lagged even-steeper decreases in the number of polluters required to have permits under the federal Clean Air Act, and in the amount of air pollution being regulated. The current DEC budget for the program is about $15.8 million, down from $19.2 million in 2009, according to DEC budget figures. During that period, the number of facilities dropped from 444 to 384, with regulated pollution also falling, from about 194,000 tons to about 100,000 tons, according to DEC. A former DEC commissioner, who now heads the Albany-based Environmental Advocates of New York, said the state has to ensure that polluters — not taxpayers — pay for the costs of the program, as is required by federal law. "I guess the question here is, does DEC have enough money to run the program. If not, why not?" asked EANY Executive Director Pete Iwanowicz. He said the program needs more support, not further cuts, and that state fees on industry need to rise again. In 2015, the state Legislature, which controls the fees, raised rates between 33 percent and 45 percent, based on emission levels. As the state has cut back the program's budget, it reduced its inspection schedule for polluting facilities from once a year to once every two years, which is the minimum federal standard. "While New York is faced with reduced revenue from permit fees, DEC has stepped up its oversight with a robust air program enforcement that has resulted in a substantial decline of emissions from regulated facilities," said DEC spokesman Sean Mahar. "It's the height of irony for Mr. Iwanowicz to use this issue to call our environmental record into question after he shepherded through the most significant staffing and funding cuts in the Department's history," said Mahar, who added that Iwanowicz was using "misinformation in the hopes of getting a quick headline." The Business Council opposed the 2015 fee increases, said Saurez, and had urged the state to reduce costs instead. He said the state should remove programs that the council claims are not required under federal law, such as outreach efforts to help small business owners comply with air pollution rules. DEC set up the air pollution control fee program in 1993, and the deficit problem goes back years. In 2008 and 2009, the state Legislature provided DEC with about $9 million to cover ongoing deficits, according to a 2011 audit by the state Comptroller's office. That audit found the program had a $3.8 million deficit in 2009 that by the next year had climbed to $10.4 million. It rose to $17.8 million by 2011. The problem has been going on for years, and in 2014, was highlighted in an audit of DEC by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That report found the program had deficits totaling about $21 million between 2010 and 2014 -- which is about where the accumulated deficits were this March. In that report, then-EPA Regional Administrator Judith Enck said the problem dated back to at least 2006, and warned that without reform, deficits in the program would continue for "years to come." EPA also said that DEC could take steps to reduce the cost of the program as a way to bring expenses in line with revenues. Federal officials also recommended that the state set up a fee program adequate to cover expenses, including allowing fees to rise annually under a cost-of-living index, rather that requiring legislative action on any increases.

 By Brian Nearing Schaghticoke Owners of a rail line have been hit with their third state environmental fine in less than four years for again failing to clean up rotted, broken railroad ties from along tracks in Rensselaer County. Pan Am Railways Inc., of North Billerica, Mass., was fined $7,500 by the state Department of Environmental Conservation for not living up to a May 2016 agreement that required it to clean up "numerous piles" of used, discarded ties on its line between Schaghticoke and Hoosick Falls, under an order filed this month. The ties were soaked in creosote, a chemical preservative, which makes them a form of solid waste under state law that must be disposed of properly. The ties are also classified as a fire hazard. Under the 2016 agreement with DEC, the company was fined $7,500 and agreed to clean up the ties by December 2016, That work was not done, according to a January inspection by DEC. In August 2013, Pan Am was fined $5,000 for failing to clean up these abandoned ties from that line. Under the first fine, the cleanup was to have been done by November 2013. Under the latest fine, Pan Am is supposed to clean up the ties "immediately" and file a long-term plan to manage old ties within 60 days. A call to the company for comment was not returned. Pan Am Railways describes itself as North America's largest regional railroad system. Its 1,700 miles of routes stretch from Rotterdam Junction to Derby, Conn., and the Canadian regions of Saint John and St. Leonard, New Brunswick. The section of rail line in Rensselaer County is heavily trafficked, and is a major east-west route between Chicago and the Atlantic coast. bnearing@timesunion­.com - 518-454-5094 - @Bnearing10

 By Brooke A. Lewis An agreement reached Wednesday aims to improve air quality in Houston by strengthening air pollution controls at Vopak North America's chemical storage terminal and wastewater treatment facility in Deer Park, according to a news release from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "This agreement means cleaner air for Houston and will improve Vopak's compliance with important federal and state laws," said Larry Starfield, acting Assistant Administrator for EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. "EPA is committed to working with state partners like Texas to achieve and ensure monitoring of compliance with environmental laws." The agreement will help resolve alleged Clean Air Act violations at Vopak's Deer Park facility. The arrangement was made between the Department of Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality with Vopak Terminal Deer Park Inc. and Vopak Logistics Services USA, Inc. Vopak North America Inc. is a subsidiary of Royal Vopak, an international tank storage company with 74 terminals in 26 countries. Vopak North America Inc. owns terminals in the U.S., including the largest one in Deer Park, which provides temporary storage for products including biofuels, chemicals, petroleum products, base oils and lubricants. As part of the agreement, Vopak will install air pollution controls at the facility's wastewater treatment facility and use infrared cameras to detect harmful air pollution from the facility's chemical storage tanks.The company will also hire a third party auditor to improve how it manages waste and evaluate its compliance with the agreement. Vopak also is required to pay a civil penalty of $2.5 million. The facility reportedly failed to comply with Clean Air Act requirements to properly manage equipment resulting in excess emissions of acetone, benzene, styrene and volatile organic compounds at an on-site wastewater treatment system, according to allegations from the EPA, the Justice Department and the State of Texas. Vopak also failed to operate flares and chemical storage tanks in accordance with good air pollution practices, based on allegations from the federal government and Texas. When excessive levels of volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants and ozone are released into the air, it can cause harmful side effects including headaches, loss of coordination, nausea, damage to liver, kidney and the central nervous system. Children and the elderly are especially at risk from suffering with these side effects.

 By Lydia DePillis If you read our Chemical Breakdown series on the poor oversight of Houston's repositories of toxic material, you already know that potentially dangerous stuff could be lurking in your backyard. That might be more common than it is in other Texas cities, according to a new analysis, because of Houston's longstanding resistance to zoning. The working paper, by economists at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Washington, takes a look at the distribution of commercial and industrial facilities throughout Chicago and several Texas cities to see how zoning had affected them over the years. Zoning typically separates buildings by their uses, so if it had any effect, you would expect to see a gradual segregation of residential, commercial, and industrial areas. This did in fact appear to have happened in Chicago since that city imposed its zoning code in 1923. Houston, naturally, served as a control case to see what happens when no comprehensive set of rules exists. Although a hazardous materials ordinance passed in 1996, preventing hazmat sites from locating in areas that are more than one-third residential, many of them were established in previous decades and aren't affected. Judging by the distribution of toxics-emitting facilities on a list maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency — which you can see for Houston here — the economists did find that polluters tend to be more densely clustered in other large Texas cities with fairly traditional zoning codes. In Houston, 65 percent of the city is within one mile of a facility in the toxic release inventory. That number is 30 percent, 44 percent, and 43 percent for Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas respectfully. Why is this an economics issue? The researchers also found that houses in single-family residential areas tended to be more valuable than those right next to manufacturing facilities. Though they didn't look at prices in Houston specifically, there's already a rich literature on how polluting facilities depress adjacent property values. Thus, it's possible that the diffuse nature of pollution sources in Houston may have made the city overall more affordable (rather than having industrial uses concentrated in one area, which creates adverse conditions mostly for the poor neighborhoods next door). Now, as with all working papers, this is just one data point in a universe of research around the impact of land-use regulation. The analysis is fairly rough, omitting the distribution of housing throughout the city. There also may simply be more polluters per square mile in Houston than there are in other cities; certainly there are some neighborhoods that host a lot more industry than others. And overall, I don't think Houston's lack of comprehensive zoning is the driving force behind its relatively cheap real estate. But it does seem logical that having pollution sources distributed throughout the city would also mean that more homes could potentially be exposed, making them less valuable as a result.

 By Dan Wallach Successful efforts to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions in Beaumont enabled the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to remove it from the agency's Air Pollutant Watch List today, a spokeswoman said. Air monitoring at Carroll Street Park near the ExxonMobil refinery complex now meets the regulatory standard for sulfur dioxide, said Andrea Morrow, TCEQ spokeswoman. >> Click the gallery above to see the most polluted places in Texas Each year the TCEQ collects an extensive amount of ambient air monitoring data and evaluates the potential for adverse health effects. The TCEQ's Air Pollutant Watch List program addresses areas in Texas where monitoring data show persistent, elevated concentrations of air toxics. Following a listing, the TCEQ works with existing industry to reduce levels and with new applicants to limit emissions of the identified pollutant. Once levels are reduced and show consistent compliance, a site can be "de-listed" from the watch list. At Carroll Street Park. emissions exceeeded the 30-minute standard on two days in 2002; one day in 2006; and one day in 2007. Mobile monitors also detected levels above standard from 2003 through 2007. An air monitor in downtown Beaumont also registered excessive sulfur dioxide on tow days in 2009 and one day in 2011. Tighter controls resulted in no excessive readings since 2012, TCEQ said. Reported sulfur dioxide emissions in the Beaumont area decreased from 3,454 tons per year in 2005 to 828 tons per year in 2014, a 76 percent reduction.

When the Environmental Protection Agency was formed 48 years ago, officials immediately realized they needed photographic documentation of the perils of pollution in the United States. Hoping to illustrate the man-made destruction happening across the nation, the EPA enlisted the help of 70 photographers, instructing them to "photographically document subjects of environmental concern." The project, which ran from 1972-77, resulted in more than 80,000 images, capturing the lives of millions of Americans. More than 15,000 of those photos were digitized and posted on the National Archive's site. We pored through the thousands of California images and found the best for the gallery above. Some of the photos are straightforward evidence of pollution: Sewage pouring into the San Francisco Bay, crop-dusting grapevines in the Central Valley or a thick bank of smog settling over the Golden Gate Bridge. Other photos are more artistic, showing breathtaking landscapes and ordinary Americans having fun or working. MORE: A photographer took these images of strangers in 1973 San Francisco.

 By Kim McGuire Planned repairs at the Pasadena Refining System plant are expected to cause the facility to release about 15 tons of fine particle pollution, contamination that can settle deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems. The release was supposed to begin Wednesday and continue through Friday, according to a report submitted by the refinery to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. During that time, the facility expects to release 20,000 pounds of fine particulate matter from one of its stacks, an amount of pollution that exceeds the level the plant is permitted to release in one year. Another stack is expected to release 10,000 pounds of the pollutant over the same time period. Particulate matter is a mix of microscopic particles and liquid droplets, including acids, organic compounds, metals, soot and dust. According to federal environmental regulators, particulate matter exposure is linked to a range of serious health problems, increased emergency room and hospital visits, decreased life expectancy and aggravated asthma. "This is a major fine particulate release," said Neil Carman, clean air program director for the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club. "One could argue there's no safe level." A spokesman for the TCEQ said the amount of pollution identified in the report is an estimate, not an actual number. That won't be verified for several days, he said. Officials with Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company that owns the refinery, did not immediately return a phone call seeking more information. Last month, Environment Texas and the Sierra Club notified the plant of their intent to sue in federal court under the Clean Air Act on allegations the refinery spewed out illegal levels of particulate matter, by the hour, over the course of five years. "I am not surprised at all (by the expected release)," Carman said. "This is a very old refinery, and the owners need to spend a lot of money to upgrade it." In July, a lightning strike caused the plant to emit 21 tons of potentially dangerous pollutants into the air and a shelter-in-place order was called for the Galena Park area. In March, a fire and explosion injured one worker. In 2011, the refinery had another fire.

 Sadly, the recent passing of Jack Welch, former head of GE, does not bring with it the successful conclusion of the pollution removal from the Hudson River in New York, nor the removal of pollution from the Housatonic River in Connecticut. Welch started with GE in 1960 and rose through the ranks, becoming chief in 1981. Now, GE wasn’t the only entity polluting the rivers, but it was probably the largest and was targeted by the EPA to provide cleanup of the river beds. For decades, ending in 1977, GE plants spewed PCBs into both the Hudson and Housatonic rivers, until use of PCBs in manufacturing was banned in 1979. While some river cleanup has been accomplished, it is not finished. The state of New York sued the Trump administration and the EPA for prematurely declaring the cleanup completed in 2019. When Welch retired in 2001 he received a retirement package of $417 million. Not too shabby. If only Welch had not fought for decades against accepting GE’s responsibility for the river cleanups, we might be able to eat the fish. And drinking the water from those rivers is problematic due to the carcinogenic properties of PCBs. That is what I call truly shabby. R.I.P. Mr. Welch. Stephen C. Jones New Haven

 By Brian Nearing Costs for the state's air pollution control system, which under federal law must be paid for by polluting industries, keep sinking under a rising tide of red ink that taxpayers keep bailing out. As of March, taxpayers have had to come up with nearly $21 million to cover chronic deficits at the state Department of Environmental Conservation, which issues air pollution permits and inspects polluting companies under the federal Clean Air Act. That shortfall at DEC was up more than 9 percent from a year earlier, according to DEC online records issued this week. The federal Clean Air Act requires that expenses for conducting inspections and issuing permits be borne by the companies that need the permits in order to pollute. This system covers about 400 companies across the state. But with too little cash coming in from fees — which are set by the state Legislature, not DEC — the agency has had to soak up chronic deficits with its own budget, with at least two cash bailouts in recent years from the Legislature. The problem has been going on for years, and in 2014, was highlighted in an audit of DEC by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In that report, then-EPA Regional Administrator Judith Enck said the problem dated back to at least 2006, and warned that without reform, deficits in the program would continue for "years to come." Asked what action, if any, is being taken to control the deficits, the DEC press office issued this statement Friday: "DEC is committed to ensuring that all sources comply with their fee obligations." DEC also said the program has been running at a deficit since 2010. The legislature raised fees in 2015, but the red ink has continued to grow since. Currently, the maximum state fee is set at $90 per ton of air pollution. In order to erase the accumulated deficits, DEC would have to raise that fee to more than $460 a ton, according to the DEC notice published online last week. DEC set up the air pollution control fee program in 1993, and the deficit problem goes back years. In 2008 and 2009, the state Legislature provided DEC with about $9 million to cover ongoing deficits, according to a 2011 audit by the state Comptroller's office. That audit found the program had a $3.8 million deficit in 2009 that by the next year had climbed to $10.4 million. It rose to $17.8 million by 2011. The Comptroller also found DEC was violating federal law that the program financially support itself, but the Comptroller has not audited the program since to see what has been done to correct that. "This program has never been set up to be self-sustaining," said Peter Iwanowicz, the executive director of the Albany-based lobbying group Environmental Advocates of New York. Iwanowicz is also a former DEC commissioner. He said there is a lack of political will in the state Legislature to set fees on industry that are high enough to cover the actual expenses of conducting air pollution inspections and issuing permits. Iwanowicz also said that, in response to the state budget crunch after the Great Recession in 2008, DEC cut expenses by reducing staff inspections of polluting facilities from once a year to once every two years, which is the minimum federal requirement. "DEC now is just scraping by, meeting minimums, and the program is still in the red," said Iwanowicz. "This is the hardly the mark of an environmental champion." In the EPA audit, Enck recommended that the state set up a fee program adequate to cover expenses, including allowing fees to rise annually under a cost-of-living index, rather that requiring legislative action on any increase. Her audit found that the program had deficits totaling about $21 million between 2010 and 2014.

 The Midland Daily News This column will be a little different than the usual approach that I take. I read an interesting commentary about an interview taken from Medcape Family Medicine, July 14, 2016, with Robert D. Brook, MD, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Michigan and Director of the Hypertension Center there. Dr. Brook is from Michigan and does research on the effects of air pollution. He said he was sitting on the beach in the late 1990s with his brother who is an atmospheric scientist. Dr. Brook thought the haze he saw on the horizon, while looking over Lake Michigan, was “sea haze.” His brother explained to him, however, that it was pollution causing the foggy atmosphere. It piqued Dr. Brook’s interest and so began his lifelong research into the effects of pollution on healthcare. As with most of us, Dr. Brook thought the major problem with air pollution was that it caused lung problems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other issues like these. Research has shown, however, that the majority of health effects from air pollution are adverse cardiovascular events. This includes heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and sudden death. Air pollution is the ninth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Air pollution in defined in terms of fine PM. A PM 2.5 means particles that are less than 2.5 µm in diameter. They result from fossil fuel combustion (coal, gas, etc.), mobile sources such as traffic, or the energy industry in the modern world. The PM for a particular size is then measured in weight/m3. In the United States, the average PM 2.5 is about 10 µg/m3. In comparison, PM levels in a smoky bar are about 500 µg/m3. A little bit confusing but just compare the numbers while reading below. For the last few years, the United States has gone down from levels of 25 to 30 µg/m3 in the 1970s and 1980s to an average level of 10 µg/m3 now. This dramatic reduction has translated into an improvement in all-cause mortality leading to a six- to seven-month increase in life expectancy on average in the United States. (I thought that was pretty impressive!) However, close to 25 percent of Americans are still exposed to levels above the World Health Organization standards of 10µg/m3. Many such areas are next to roadways or in urban industrial locations. People in Asia, particularly China and India, are exposed to far higher levels of pollution than we now are. These are also the areas where cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are escalating dramatically. It is interesting to note that second-hand smoke levels are around 500 µg/m3. One cigarette delivers well over 5000 to 10,000 µg/m3. One cigarette is comparable to a month’s worth of exposure to air pollution in Beijing, China! So how does air pollution trigger the cardiovascular/heart problems? Extensive research has shown different ways. Pollutants injure the lining of the blood vessels, they cause the blood vessels to constrict and narrow, and the platelets in the blood which are involved in clotting become more sensitized and clot more easily. This all leads to more clots in the vessels (strokes and heart attacks) and arrhythmias in the heart (sudden death). (I’m simplifying this significantly!) Then the next question is: How do the pollutants do these things? For those of you who have read this column regularly, you have learned that it appears that inflammation is the first step in the cascade of events that cause strokes, heart attacks, cancer and dementia. Reduce inflammation and you reduce all of these major killers. It turns out that when the lung inhales pollution particles, the lung tissue becomes inflamed. The inflammation isn’t just isolated to the lungs, but rather inflammatory chemicals throughout the body are increased. Subsequently, the inflammation causes vascular and cardiovascular tissue to be inflamed, causing constricting of the vessels, as well as the clotting and buildup of atheroscleratic plaques. Interesting! Inflammation is the culprit once again. Many of us have heard about inflammation around the gums (gingivitis) causing heart disease. It’s part of the same story. Gingivitis causes significant inflammation which generalizes throughout the body. It is the chemicals that cause inflammation that lead to the major problems of strokes, heart attacks, cancer, and dementia. A second way that air pollution leads to heart problems is that the lung can sense these foreign particles and promote rapid changes in the body’s chemistry. It’s sort of the “flight or fight” response. Our body surges with various hormonal chemicals when it feels “attacked” and that leads to an increase in blood pressure, constriction of blood vessels, and heart arrhythmias. The final way that the pollution affects the heart and blood vessels is that the very chemicals causing the pollution are toxic in themselves. Those chemicals are absorbed through the lungs and have a direct effect on various body tissues. There are thousands of very fine particles of organic chemicals and metals in pollution. Cigarette smoke is a convenient way to deliver nicotine into the body, but the air we breathe delivers many of those other chemicals also. If scientists can detect these bodily responses to short term exposures to pollutants, imagine what happens over the long term. Think of the adverse effects on the body’s systems. We must remember that pollution is not the only factor causing heart and lung problems. Diet, obesity and exercise all play a role. But when you add on pollution, the effects multiply. One final thing in the interview was discussion of the mask that you see many Asians wearing when they are in the major cities. Do they filter out pollution? Mostly the masks being worn are simple surgical masks that protect people from respiratory droplets. They aren’t made to protect us from the fine particles in air. China and the rest of Asia are often exposed to PM levels between 100 to 500 µg/m3 (10 to 50 times what the average level is in the United States). There is some evidence showing that home air filters or purifications systems with HEPA filters do reduce exposures and lead to improved health. Research is ongoing. So, as I noted, this is a little different approach to my usual column, but rather interesting stuff, isn’t it? Dr. John L. Pfenninger’s column appears on Sundays. His office, Medical Procedures Center, is located in Midland.

 Capital News Service LANSING — Hoping for a quick thaw to escape the winter blues? Not so fast. A fast melt of accumulated snow could harm Michigan waters. The problem: Winter application of manure to farm fields. Rapidly melting snow runs off frozen ground and heads toward lakes and streams. It can carrying with it manure that sat on top of the snow. “It’s certainly a possibility with this much snow and especially if we have a fast melt,” said Janet Kauffman, vice president for Environmentally Concerned Citizens of South Central Michigan. “It’s serious if there’s melt on the surface but the ground is frozen (and) it eventually flows off.” Snow accumulation in the state has been above average this year, National Weather Service Meteorologist Jared Maples said. Grand Rapids and Muskegon have more than 40 inches above yearly averages, while Lansing has more than 15 inches above the yearly average. The amount of water in the snow varies by location, Maples said, although areas lower in the state might have higher volumes. Currently, Grand Rapids has an estimated 5.6 inches of water in the snow, he said. While Maples said it’s difficult to foresee what kind of melt the state will have, indications are the coming weeks will remain cold. If manure reaches lakes and rivers, bacteria could harm fish and other aquatic creatures, said Karen Tommasulo, a public information officer with the Department of Environmental Quality. Phosphorous in manure causes algal blooms that can rob the water of oxygen. Other nutrients and bacteria could contaminate water and kill fish, Kauffman said. The International Joint Commission recently recommended that winter manure spreading be banned near Lake Erie, which has had issues with algal blooms in recent years. The binational agency advises the U.S. and Canada on issues involving waterways that they share. Spreading manure in the winter is high risk and should be banned, Kauffman said. Farmers are advised to avoid spreading manure in the winter if possible. Not all farmers spread manure in the winter. But they might have to if they lack storage for it or have winter crops, such as winter wheat, which need the nutrients, said Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau. Campbell said phosphorous contamination has many origins and that only one is farming. Those with insufficient storage space are typically smaller farms, Campbell said. Depending on farm size and whether it is an animal feeding operation, the smaller farms might not be required to hold permits for spreading manure, said Nicole Zacharda, enforcement specialist with the Department of Environment Quality Water Resources Division. Those that are required to hold the permits, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs, are required to have room enough for six months of manure storage. There are almost 250 of those in Michigan. Farmers should distribute manure at least 150 feet from any surface water and avoid putting the manure on fields with slopes, said Shelby Bollwahn, livestock environmental educator with Michigan State University Extension. People can report runoff to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s spill response at 1-800-405-0101 and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality’s Pollution Control hotline at 800-292-4706. Farmers who cause a runoff problem that pollutes the water could be fined between $2,500 and $25,000, Zacharda said. The Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program helps farmers prepare and avoid runoff by teaching best practices and helping determine ideal fields for winter manure application. Program manager Jan Wilford said 600 of Michigan’s about 22,000 livestock farms are in the program and have had no issues polluting Michigan water in 12 years. “I don’t think it’s something to panic about,” Campbell said. “Our farmers are really aware of the water patterns.” Banning the practice would also lead to farmers spreading manure only twice a year, creating a higher risk for large amounts of pollution if runoff occurs at those times, Wilford said. However, some critics of the practice are still concerned. “There is a fundamental problem that we can collect so much liquid waste and then try to spread it on fields,” said Anne Woiwode, state director of the Sierra Club’s Michigan chapter. Woiwode said although some say that banning the practice would hurt small farms and force them out of business, industrial agriculture practices have put small farms in this position. Bollwahn said while warmer weather and potential rain could create higher risk for runoff, the farmers have the tools to deal with potential issues. Besides following best practices, once runoff is identified, Zacharda said farmers can use sand to stop the flow or pumps to remove the manure from water after it has sunk to the bottom.

 MNA Staff LANSING — Hoping for a quick thaw to escape the winter blues? Not so fast. A fast melt of accumulated snow could harm Michigan waters. The problem: Winter application of manure to farm fields. Rapidly melting snow runs off frozen ground and heads toward lakes and streams. It can carrying with it manure that sat on top of the snow. Snow accumulation in the state has been above average this year, National Weather Service Meteorologist Jared Maples said. Grand Rapids and Muskegon have more than 40 inches above yearly averages, while Lansing has more than 15 inches above the yearly average. The amount of water in the snow varies by location, Maples said, although areas lower in the state might have higher volumes. Currently, Grand Rapids has an estimated 5.6 inches of water in the snow, he said. While Maples said it’s difficult to foresee what kind of melt the state will have, indications are the coming weeks will remain cold. If manure reaches lakes and rivers, bacteria could harm fish and other aquatic creatures, said Karen Tommasulo, a public information officer with the Department of Environmental Quality. Phosphorous in manure causes algal blooms that can rob the water of oxygen. Other nutrients and bacteria could contaminate water and kill fish, Kauffman said. The International Joint Commission recently recommended that winter manure spreading be banned near Lake Erie, which has had issues with algal blooms in recent years. The binational agency advises the U.S. and Canada on issues involving waterways that they share. Spreading manure in the winter is high risk and should be banned, Kauffman said. Farmers are advised to avoid spreading manure in the winter if possible. Not all farmers spread manure in the winter. But they might have to if they lack storage for it or have winter crops, such as winter wheat, which need the nutrients, said Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau. Campbell said phosphorous contamination has many origins and that only one is farming. Those with insufficient storage space are typically smaller farms, Campbell said. Depending on farm size and whether it is an animal feeding operation, the smaller farms might not be required to hold permits for spreading manure, said Nicole Zacharda, enforcement specialist with the Department of Environment Quality Water Resources Division. Those that are required to hold the permits, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs, are required to have room enough for six months of manure storage. There are almost 250 of those in Michigan. Farmers should distribute manure at least 150 feet from any surface water and avoid putting the manure on fields with slopes, said Shelby Bollwahn, livestock environmental educator with Michigan State University Extension. People can report runoff to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s spill response at 1-800-405-0101 and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality’s Pollution Control hotline at 800-292-4706.

Harry Pylypiw, professor of chemistry, Courtney McGinnis, assistant professor of biology, and their student, John Chiari, began studying the river for the summer on May 12. “I’m excited about going out into the field,” Chiari said. “I enjoy trying to implement the things I’ve learned in lab and in the classroom. There will be a lot of chemistry and organic chemistry involved and it will be interesting to see how that affects the environment.” This eight-week study will identify and quantify known pollutants diethylhexyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, along with other phthalate plasticizers and organotins in water from the Quinnipiac River, with particular attention to the parts of the river from Community Lake in Wallingford to the mouth of the tidal basin in New Haven. “The impact on the community is to provide information on the general health of the river,” Pylypiw said. “Basically, it’s to inform the general public in the Hamden, North Haven, Wallingford and New Haven area of the general health of the type of fish that they could be taking out of the river.” Quinnipiac has received the grant every year since 2010. Pylypiw, McGinnis and Chiari, who is the seventh student to participate since 2010, will work about 40 hours per week. “The students get a lot of research experience,” Pylypiw said. “They get a chance to work with scientists. They collect samples, analyze samples, analyze their data and present their data. The students get to do exactly what a scientists would do. It’s a good experience for them.” Efforts will also be directed to known industrial discharge points such as Cytec Industries in Wallingford. The analysis of these organic chemical contaminants in water and sediments will be investigated for their potential to accumulate in the Quinnipiac River and its watershed. This project will focus on the environmental impact of organic chemical contaminants in the Quinnipiac watershed and will add significantly to our knowledge of potential environmental pollutants. This project will also benefit the people who access the Quinnipiac River for the purposes of recreation and fishing. “I’m excited to get out and investigate the health of the Quinnipiac River,” McGinnis said. The findings will be presented to the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven in the fall.

 By EMERY P. DALESIO RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina judge said Friday he wants to review a surprise deal settling decades of groundwater pollution at Duke Energy's coal ash pits because he questioned the motives behind the company's deal with state environmental regulators. The deal reduced the $25 million fine at a Wilmington power plant that state regulators had promoted as the largest penalty for environmental damage in state history. The agreement cut the fine to $7 million but also sought to resolve groundwater pollution claims at all 14 of the company's power plants storing toxic coal ash, not just one. The judge who signed off on the settlement last fall went too far with his order that seemed to close lawsuits involving conservation groups, Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway said. "It is a bit surprising that in a penalty case over one plant, it developed into as comprehensive a settlement as this," Ridgeway said. The Department of Environmental Quality could decide the appropriate fine for Duke Energy polluting the groundwater at its Sutton power plant, Ridgeway said. But because Administrative Law Judge Phil Berger Jr. wasn't asked to rewrite the scope of his order approving the deal, Ridgeway said he suspected the settlement's language was designed to close the courtroom door to environmental groups or others. "I have to suspect that there is some ulterior motive," he said. The parties later agreed to ask Berger to revise his order, Duke Energy spokeswoman Erin Culbert said. Berger is the son of state Senate leader Phil Berger. The Republican's district includes Eden, site of a 2014 spill of toxic coal ash that prompted a new law requiring Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash holding pits by 2029. State water quality officials knew for years about the contamination at Sutton's unlined ash pits but took no enforcement action until August 2013 — after a citizens groups tried to sue Duke Energy. Monitoring wells near Duke's dumps at Sutton showed readings exceeding state groundwater standards for chemicals including boron and thallium, which was used in rat poison until it was banned because it is highly toxic. The hearing came on the day DEQ signed off for the first time on plans to drain the water off the top of basins where coal ash is collected, a needed step to closing, excavating or covering them. The state permit for work at Duke Energy's Riverbend power plant in Mount Holly is intended to be a model for documents needed to close coal ash pits around the state. It allows water to be diverted to rivers and streams until 3 feet of water remains above the ash. Duke Energy will be required to test fish near the discharge site to see whether their bodies contain collected mercury or lead, and twice a year test the waterway for those heavy metals and arsenic, chromium and cadmium. ___ Follow Emery P.

 Frances Stead Sellers, The Washington Post Caption Close PHILADELPHIA - Julie Slavet leaned over the concrete culvert where Rock Run meets Tacony Creek and sniffed. "At least it doesn't smell today," she said, crediting the chilly air. Still, the cold did nothing to hide the shimmering brown-green stains on rocks or the toilet paper, condoms and other best-not-identified objects ensnared in overhanging branches where high water had flushed them out of the sewers. "Kids swim just below here in the summer," said Slavet, director of the Tookany/Tacony-Frankford Watershed Partnership, which has been collaborating with the city's efforts to rid this 300-acre Northeast Philadelphia park of the putrid discharge by installing rain gardens, brightly painted trash cans and a giant water storage tank beneath a baseball field. But that cleanup effort is facing a growing challenge: climate change. Rising temperatures create more frequent intense downpours that overwhelm urban systems, sending raw sewage into waterways. Many cities, from the Washington to Chicago and San Francisco, have been scrambling to find ways to slow the flow. Some are building huge storage basins; others are renegotiating their legal obligations to limit pollution; and many are developing green solutions to stanch rainwater runoff before it enters drains. For those involved in such efforts, Philadelphia has literally been unpaving the way. "Communities across the country are watching, trying to learn how to do this," said Nancy Stoner, president of Potomac Riverkeeper Network and an acting assistant administrator for water at the Environmental Protection Agency from 2011 to 2014. Since entering into an innovative partnership with the EPA almost a decade ago, Philadelphia has become a testing ground for green technologies. The problems along Tacony Creek - and in countless urban waterways - begin way upstream, Slavet explained as she surveyed the trash-strewn culvert. Rainwater trickles off roofs and roads into drains that join the sewers, mixing the runoff with everything people flush down their toilets or toss into their kitchen disposals. It's the same story across 60% of Philadelphia, and in other, older cities where the storm water and sewage systems are combined, and many waterways, like Rock Run, have been enclosed as part of the sewage system. The destination of this toxic brew? One of Philadelphia's three giant treatment plants, where contaminants are removed. But during heavy storms - or about once a week here in Tacony Creek Park - the runoff floods the system. To prevent backups into people's basements, Philadelphia has 164 safety valves, like the two giant outlets here in the park that release the diluted sewage directly into creeks. And from here, it's all downhill to the Delaware River and the Atlantic Ocean. Unless, that is, the rainwater can be trapped before going into drains - in residential rain barrels and rain gardens, in roadside tree trenches and bioswales - and then released more slowly or reabsorbed into the atmosphere through evaporation. That's the goal of the $4.5 billion, 25-year Green City, Clean Waters program, implemented here in 2011. In a typical year, Philadelphia used to release more than 13 billion gallons of effluent into its open waterways. GCCW aims to capture and treat 85% of the combined sewer flow, or about 8 billion gallons a year by 2036. So far, it is on track. In the first five years of the program, the volume was reduced by 1.71 billion gallons, and the water department should exceed its 10-year goal of an annual reduction of more than 2 billion gallons. The challenge of reinforcing Philadelphia's 3,000-mile pipe network with green infrastructure, it turns out, lies not so much in re-engineering the existing system as in building the municipal, commercial and residential partnerships necessary to make a new system work. "When you try to change the character of a neighborhood, it's very difficult," Stoner said. The program involves creating "greened acres" - expanses of impervious land that are transformed either to absorb the first 1 1/2 inches of rainfall or send it into rain gardens or other local green infrastructure systems. By the end of 2019, the city had created more than 1,500 of a projected 10,000 greened acres. From the planning stage through the construction and ongoing maintenance, the installations have required coordination among city agencies and with schools, businesses, nonprofit entities, politicians, residents, developers and landowners. "We had sold people on the concept, but we did not expect the level of complexity that was required, the level of partnership," said Paula Conolly, director of the Green Infrastructure Leadership Exchange, who used to work at the water department. "We had no idea." For Slavet and others in partnership organizations, the model remains both inspiring and daunting. "It was really visionary, but it's much harder than everyone thought," she said, explaining that the process has convinced her of the need for federal investment in overhauling the nation's infrastructure, particularly in low-income parts of a cash-strapped city such as Philadelphia. The challenges have mounted with the novel-coronavirus outbreak, as Slavet has moved programs online and encouraged people to get out in nature while observing social-distancing guidelines. Some parks have fliers up, but not this one, and Slavet has been working with a team to make laminated signs. "There's a lack of information in Spanish," she said. "I am sure other languages, too." A citywide map of the new installations suggests that some lower-income neighborhoods have been slower to accept free rain barrels or make simple adaptations such as putting in planters and the porous paving stones that are recommended by RainCheck, a three-way partnership between the water department, the nonprofit Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, and the Sustainable Business Network, which coordinates with subcontractors. "The education and advocacy is crucial," said Zachary Popkin, program manager at PHS, who said almost 8,000 people have taken part in required workshops. "Maintenance is really important." The reason becomes obvious as Popkin tours completed projects in West Philadelphia, pointing out an entire block where neighbors have banded together to reduce runoff with below-grade tree plantings, as well as individual houses where owners have installed rain gardens on front lawns, ripped up driveways and replaced them with porous materials, and attached brightly colored 55-gallon barrels to their downspouts. These systems work only if filters are kept clean and barrels are emptied before a storm so that they can collect as much water as possible when the skies open. David Krueger, who replaced his driveway with porous paving about seven years ago said he decided to fill in some gaps in the new pavers after they proved to be a tripping hazard. Still, he remains an advocate for the program. "With climate change, rainfalls are going to get worse, and we wanted to be part of the solution," Krueger said. There is no easy way to measure the program's more ambitious goals of improving the triple bottom line - making Philadelphia a better place to live socially, environmentally and financially - by beautifying neighborhoods, reducing summer heat and creating green jobs. Published research and the water department's own surveys suggest "participants overwhelmingly feel that green storm water infrastructure projects are a good investment," said Deputy Water Commissioner Marc Cammarata. While residents speak with gratitude about the improvements rain gardens bring to communal areas, a few complain that trash collects in them. "They don't keep it like they should," said Monica Carvajel, waiting for a bus beside one of the most impressive projects - a half-mile stretch of rain gardens at Centennial Park, site of the 1876 Worlds Fair, where the water department partnered with the Fairmount Park Conservancy, Philadelphia Parks and Recreation and others in a $5 million makeover. The new green infrastructure should keep almost 150,000 gallons of runoff from adjacent neighborhoods out of the wastewater system in each storm, while enhancing the setting with benches, swings and plantings that will provide new habitat for wildlife. As he sat on one of the benches and scanned his iPhone, Dyland Geraod said the improvements had turned him into a daily visitor. "A lot of people be sitting here, just chilling," he said. The renewed pleasure that residents such as Geraod take in their surroundings buoy the program's advocates even as they are wary about rainfall trends. Philadelphia gets about 42 inches of rain a year, according to the National Weather Service. But the past decade was the wettest on record, and in 2018, the city was drenched by more than 62 inches of rain. "We design with climate change in mind," said Howard Neukrug, a former water commissioner who said the partnership deal he helped cut almost a decade ago with the EPA is more malleable than the consent decrees many cities entered into to meet federal pollution standards. "The reality is that things change; you need to adapt," he said, sitting in a coffee shop at the University of Pennsylvania, where he has started a water center to study sustainable urban water systems. The model was cheaper than trying to separate the extensive sewer and storm water systems - a way for the city to work with the EPA on a shared solution that has inspired support from environmental nonprofits including the William Penn Foundation, which gives grants of about $2 million annually to support the greening and provide related job training. GCCW is now built into the way the city works, with discounts on stormwater fees for non-residential owners who retrofit their properties and requirements for new development to manage its own runoff. Any attempt to defund it, Neukrug said, would be met by a "a much more educated and vocal group of advocates - as well as the EPA." The long-term project has also brought into relief shifting concerns, including whether the environmental improvements will force up house prices in some neighborhoods and drive out longtime residents. Ryan Miller, stopped at a bench right above T-14, the biggest of the city's outfalls where the stench wafts up in hot weather. He's watched the rain gardens being installed along with a new spray pad to provide an alternative to the creek for kids seeing relief from the summer heat. But he worries change isn't coming quickly enough. "I went down there when I was a kid," Miller said. "It's pretty bad."

 Tribune News Services ST. JOHNS – The buckets of water were lined up in a row, spaced about 20 feet apart, each taken from a different river or stream in Clinton County. Then up strolled Crush, a perky Jack Russell terrier-Australian Cattle dog mix, on a leash ahead of her trainer, Aryn Hervel. The dog briefly sniffed each water bucket, lying down alongside most — the signal to her trainer that the bucket was a “hit” for the presence of the substance she’s trained to detect: human waste. As detection dog jobs go, sniffing out human poop seems far less glamorous than those pooches seeking bombs or drugs in an airport. But Crush and the seven other dogs working for Environmental Canine Services are playing a unique and valuable role for local governments, as detectives helping protect public health and the environment. Karen and Scott Reynolds, both dog trainers, started their business in 2009 in Lansing. Scott Reynolds also worked as an environmental scientist at the time, and often was tasked with tedious, time-consuming storm water testing for bacteria such as E. coli, which is derived from human waste and can seriously sicken people when they contact or drink it at certain concentrations. It was Scott’s boss who suggested they train a dog to sniff out human waste in rivers, streams or other water, Karen Reynolds said. The couple tried with one of their dogs, and it worked. “It’s similar to training any scenting dog — a narcotics dog; a search-and-rescue dog,” she said. “It’s the same principle, just a different scent.” As word got around about the service, demand grew. Scott Reynolds’ employer wasn’t interested in taking on more such work, so the couple branched out on their own, Karen Reynolds said. “We’re the only company in the world that does this, that we know of,” she said. Now based out of their home in Turner, Maine, the company operates waste-detecting dogs there, as well as with the help of handlers and dogs in Lansing and San Francisco. They’ve worked on 75 projects in nine different states and will add two more states to the list with jobs in Vermont and Connecticut next month, Karen Reynolds said. What the dogs provide to a local government is a time- and money-saving process of elimination, Reynolds said. Agencies such as the Clinton Conservation District may in the past have sent in hundreds of water samples to a laboratory, at a cost of $25 to $50 per sample, to try to narrow down the location of pollution problems. And those bacterial tests often don’t indicate whether the problem is from human or animal waste, she said. Her dogs can do the detection work on the spot; usually first with bucket samples and then heading out into the field, moving up streams and rivers to find the source of a problem, she said. The dogs are trained only to hit on human waste — not animal — she added. “What might take people several months to track sources, sometimes the dogs can get close to the source in a day,” she said. The City of Santa Barbara, Calif., was having significant E. coli water contamination problems in 2010 and couldn’t pinpoint a source. Officials called in two of the Reynoldses’ dogs, using a special environmental grant. Working manhole cover to manhole cover in a shopping mall parking lot, the dog within two hours hit on a spot that ultimately revealed a broken sewer line under the street, leaking next to a storm drain that also was cracked, Karen Reynolds said. The city had the problem fixed within a day, she said. The company has six working dogs and two in training, which takes about a year for certification. “The dogs love it — it’s like a puzzle for them to work out,” Hervel said. “For them, it’s a video game.” Crush came with Hervel from California to Clinton County, because the company’s Lansing-based dogs already had worked in another area recently and are rested at least weekly between jobs. The diminutive Crush is one of the company’s most-traveled dogs because she can fly in an airplane cabin, Reynolds said. They don’t allow their dogs in airplane cargo holds out of concerns for the animals’ safety, she said. Prior to her adoption by Hervel and training, Crush was returned to the animal shelter three times, Hervel said. Too rambunctious, they said. Always climbing on the furniture. Out of control. “Nobody wanted her,” she said. “She just needed a job.” As Clinton County’s water samples were laid out Thursday, a blank sample bucket with distilled water was added to the row. Crush laid down next to each bucket, signifying they had human waste contamination — but passed the blank bucket by after a quick poke in the top of the bucket with her snout. The hits only signify the yes-or-no presence of human waste bacteria; not whether it’s at levels that prompt health concerns, Karen Reynolds said. “We’ve been having a lot of conversations with our county commissioners,” said Clinton Conservation District Executive Director John Switzer. “We’re talking about septic systems and septic maintenance and they are saying, ‘Isn’t it all coming from the farms?’ ” Using Environmental Canine Services, “we’re able to say the human sources are having an impact in our watershed, too.” The district plans outreach and education efforts in any areas identified by the dogs as having failed septic systems, district watershed coordinator Paige Filice said. “It’s going to be a lot easier to send out 500 postcards saying, ‘Pump your septic’ than thousands,” she said. Environmental Canine Services also offers “ship-and-sniff” services, where samples can be mailed to the company for the dogs to check before any on-site services. The Saginaw Chippewa Indian tribe recently utilized the service, enabling them to narrow 30 samples down to seven for more extensive upstream testing, Reynolds said. All told, Crush “hit” for some level of human sewage contamination on 22 of 25 water containers from district waterways. “Sorry,” Reynolds said sheepishly to Switzer and Filice. “Well, we have more work to do, right?” replied Switzer. “We’re no longer just suspicious,” added Filice. The company and district officials planned to use the bucket tests to determine where to send Crush out into the field for further testing Friday.

 LCS Staff Caption Close By Ryan Coffey Michigan State University Extension For many the arrival of spring brings “spring cleaning” — household projects such as tidying up the yard, attic, basement or garage. These projects often involve the removal and disposal of many unsightly and even potentially dangerous materials. Unfortunately, too often these items are allowed to accumulate in yards. Junk has become such a nuisance in rural Michigan communities that it has been identified as one of the top problems in many recent public surveys. In Newaygo County, for example, several community surveys have consistently identified junk as a primary concern by many residents and local officials. Accumulated junk is more than a mere annoyance, it can pose serious hazards for a community. Junk is not only visually repulsive, it can also harbor vermin such as rats and provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes, both of which can carry disease. Leached toxic chemicals, oils and paints into the ground can cause pollution and damage groundwater (the source of many rural Michigander’s drinking water) and even make it into our lakes and streams. These problems can also negatively affect neighboring property values. Local officials can address junk at the township, city and village level (under the auspices of providing for the health, safety and welfare of its residents) by adopting a junk ordinance that prohibits its build-up and requires the removal of existing junk. These ordinances also provide for ordinance enforcement through citation and fines. Michigan State University Extension provides a guide entitled “How to Deal with Accumulated Junk Problems” that includes a sample junk ordinance for communities looking to address and regulate the accumulation of junk. While this method can be effective by relying on complaints and policing to identify existing problem properties, additional proactive steps can also be taken to clean up communities. In recent years, several innovative communities have taken a comprehensive and coordinated “carrot-and-stick” approach to address accumulated junk. In addition to using the “stick” of ordinance adoption and enforcement, local communities offer “carrots” to their residents through local programs. For example, many cities and townships now offer clean-up days where residents can bring in junk (including large items such as appliances and furniture) to transfer stations free-of-charge. In addition, many municipalities have partnered with local recycling programs to offer drop-off locations where residents can bring cardboard, plastic, glass and metal. You can do your part as well. In addition to participating in clean-up days and recycling programs, you can also invite others who could benefit from taking part in these programs. Keep an eye out for special collections in your community. There are often programs that will take specialized items such as tires, batteries and electronics.

 HONOLULU (AP) — A pair of environmental advocates has launched an organization to help rid Hawaii of cesspools that threaten public health and the marine environment. Wastewater Alternatives and Innovations plans to help the state address sewage pollution by finding ways to convert cesspools to effective treatment systems, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Sunday. Stuart Coleman left his position as Hawaii manager of the Surfrider Foundation to devote his efforts to assist the state and homeowners with cesspool conversion. He teamed with John Anner of the Coral Reef Alliance to start the nonprofit organization. Anner previously operated an international nonprofit group that sought solutions to wastewater issues in Southeast Asian countries. Coleman was first alerted to the state’s sewage pollution problem when Honolulu diverted 48 million gallons (181.6 million liters) of raw sewage into the Ala Wai Canal after a sewage line ruptured. The spill forced the city to temporarily close beaches in Waikiki. There are about 88,000 cesspools across the state releasing 53 million gallons (200.6 million liters) of raw sewage into the groundwater daily. About 90% of Hawaii’s drinking water comes from groundwater, state officials said. Untreated wastewater from cesspools contains pathogens that can cause gastroenteritis, hepatitis A, conjunctivitis, leptospirosis, salmonella, and cholera. The cost of cesspool upgrades can range from $20,000 to $30,000, officials said. “I think people recognize this is an important issue and we’re one of the only organizations that’s dedicated to it exclusively in helping to solve the problem,” Coleman said. The state passed a 2016 statewide cesspool ban and legislation to provide tax credits to assist homeowners with cesspool upgrades. “The bottom line is our state depends on tourism and we just can’t afford to have dirty water because it affects our health, our environment and our basic economy,” Coleman said. Coleman also serves as a member of the state’s cesspool conversion working group tasked with developing a long-range, comprehensive plan to replace all cesspools of any size by 2050. Several bills have been introduced in the current legislative session to help the state reach the 2050 deadline. “The goal is to get rid of all the cesspools," Anner said. "There’s no one solution that will work for everybody.”

 By Jennifer A. Dlouhy WASHINGTON — Giving into energy industry complaints, the federal government said Wednesday that companies will get extra time to install equipment to capture pollution from natural gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations nationwide. Companies now will have until Jan. 1, 2015, to begin using “green completion” equipment that can pare emissions at natural gas wells under a first-of-its-kind air pollution rule the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled Wednesday. The EPA originally had planned to impose those requirements within 60 days of rolling out the measure, which represents the first federal mandate governing pollution from the hydraulic fracturing operations credited with unlocking a 100-year supply of the fossil fuel. The concession to the energy industry comes as the Obama administration seeks to demonstrate its support for domestic natural gas production while still pledging environmental protections. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a mixture of water, sand and chemicals deep underground to release trapped oil and natural gas. For a period of days after a well is fractured and before natural gas production begins, smog-forming volatile organic compounds and other substances can escape at the surface. Last March, pollution from natural gas drilling in the Upper Green River Basin in western Wyoming triggered levels of ground-level ozone, the main ingredient in smog, worse than those recorded in Los Angeles, one of the smoggiest cities in the U.S. The EPA mandate is aimed at reining in emissions from a range of natural gas operations, including the initial drilling of wells, production at the sites and transportation of the product. The EPA has said complying with the mandates would reduce methane emissions by 26 percent and toxic air emissions by 30 percent. Leading industry trade groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said there wasn't enough of the emission-cutting equipment to go around. An estimated 25,000 new and existing natural gas wells are fractured or refractured each year. But API President Jack Gerard warned last week that just 300 sets of the emissions-reducing equipment are available in the U.S. EPA Assistant Administrator Gina McCarthy said moving back the deadline will “provide time for industry to order and manufacture enough equipment as well as train personnel to conduct green completions.” Until they install the new equipment, companies will have to rely on flaring to burn off excess gas, which McCarthy said will itself reduce 90 percent of volatile organic compounds emitted. In a conference call with reporters, McCarthy pitched the delay as a common-sense approach and rejected notions that the EPA had caved to the oil industry, which has been lobbying for changes. “It's just as stringent as we originally proposed, but it's been adjusted based on data we've seen,” McCarthy said. Some energy companies already use green completions on most of their wells. Because the emissions-reducing equipment captures natural gas and other compounds that can be sold, the EPA estimates that the industry stands to save $11 million to $19 million annually using the technology. The EPA also decided to extend the deadline for other pollution-cutting mandates, including requirements governing storage tanks and other natural gas infrastructure. But the agency rebuffed industry's argument to exempt facilities at which 10 percent or less of emissions are from volatile organic compounds. David McCabe, a senior scientist with the Clean Air Task Force, called the rule “a solid start” toward protecting the public from high ozone levels amid a surge in hydraulic fracturing. But David Doniger, policy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's climate and clean air program, said the group was disappointed by the more-than-two-year delay. “It should not take that long to build more of the truck-mounted rigs that can capture these gases and put them into the pipelines to be sold at a profit instead of leaked into our air,” Doniger said.

 Brady Dennis and Chris Mooney, The Washington Post The United Nations plans to postpone a pivotal climate conference scheduled for November amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, delaying an international effort to head off the worst consequences of climate change. The gathering, scheduled to be hosted by the United Kingdom in November in Glasgow, Scotland, was envisioned as a moment for nations to offer more ambitious plans to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and transition away from reliance on fossil fuels. The arena where the massive event was to take place, the SEC Centre, is being converted into a field hospital for patients with covid-19, the disease caused by the novel virus, the Scottish government said this week. Alok Sharma, a British official who had been tapped as president of the climate conference, tweeted the news on Wednesday afternoon. "We will continue working with partners to deliver the ambition needed to tackle the climate crisis & agree a new date," he wrote. Separately, Finland's Minister of Environment and CLimate Change, Krista Mikkonen, tweeted to say the gathering had been postponed. The postponement of the meeting comes as global emissions have continued to rise, although many experts now think that trend will temporarily reverse due to the pandemic and its impact on global travel, energy use and the economy. In 2019, emissions are estimated to have set a new all time high of 36.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide. To limit the planet's warming to the most stringent target of just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, emissions must fall by nearly 50 percent by the year 2030, scientists say. According to the United Nations' Environment Programme, reaching that goal means average annual cuts of 7.6 percent starting in 2020. Average temperatures on the planet have already increased more than 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) and triggered increasingly severe consequences, including global dieoffs of coral reefs and rapid ice loss in Greenland and Antarctica, which in turn has accelerated sea level rise. The Earth is currently on course to see more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4. degrees Fahrenheit) of warming by the end of the century unless stronger action is taken, according to the U.N. Such continued warming could kill virtually all coral reefs, cause catastrophic flooding along coastlines and in cities, and result in more extreme weather, among other problems. The world has pledged to hold warming to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius, but it remains far off track. Altering the globe's troubling trajectory of emissions was to be the primary focus of the Scotland meeting that is now postponed. The coronavirus has amplified the uncertainty about the world's resolve to tackle climate change. While the outbreak has appeared to temporarily reduce pollution and damage the oil industry, it has shifted attention away from climate change and is now upending international meetings and negotiations. It is also unclear whether the economic strain of the pandemic will affect plans by countries to pour additional resources and focus into tackling climate change. Officials said the U.N. gathering is likely to be rescheduled for the middle of 2021, although no date has been set.

 RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Dominion Energy will pay $1.4 million to the state of Virginia and the United States as part of a settlement to address alleged violations that involved coal ash and groundwater seepage. Coal ash is heavy metal-laden waste leftover from burning the fossil fuel to produce electricity. The office of Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring announced the agreement in a statement on Friday. The settlement stems from a complaint that was filed against Dominion. It said the company violated a pollution discharge permit when it released more than 27 million gallons of water from a coal ash impoundment at its Possum River Power Station without providing required specific advance notice. The complaint also alleged that groundwater seepage was observed along the shoreline of the James River near Dominion’s Chesterfield Power Station. As part of the agreement, the company will conduct multiple environmental compliance audits at numerous facilities and put a comprehensive environmental management system in place, Herring's office said. Dominion did not admit to any liability or facts alleged in the complaint, according to the agreement.

 By JANE DALE OWEN I've spent a good part of my life in Houston, where oil is king. My family certainly has benefited from the prosperity this industry has afforded. My grandfather, Robert Lee Blaffer, was one of the founders of Humble Oil and Refining Company, parent company of ExxonMobil. My mother, Jane Blaffer Owen, married Kenneth Dale Owen, renowned geologist and founder of Gulf Shore Oil Company. I am a shareholder in ExxonMobil who votes for change that helps protect the environment and public health. For many years, I have supported efforts such as Campaign ExxonMobil to educate shareholders about the power they hold by voting to press the company to make environmentally responsible decisions. In the early days of new oil wells and the discovery of all that this energy source could do for our country, no one could predict the environmental and health consequences of drilling and processing fossil fuel we are facing today. "Like every benefit, it can turn on itself and, in time, turn on us. Oil is beneficial - the greed and power that come with the production and selling of this energy source is out of hand," my mother said in a 2006 interview for Citizens League for Environmental Action Now. "I was born into a conservative family. My father was a president and treasurer of an oil company. He would be appalled at the squandering of money and resources today." My mother, who died a year ago last June, also believed that this country, once a republic with "one spirit, one body, many limbs" had become a "depersonalized empire." Texas Gov. Rick Perry has turned a blind eye to the damage this industry is causing to the environment and public health. He brags about the lack of industry regulations that could help reduce toxic emissions from oil refineries, protect our children from mercury emissions spewing out of coal-fired power plant smoke stacks and prevent contamination of our precious aquifers. In all his wisdom, he has even sued the Environmental Protection Agency over new rules that would help reduce air pollution, and he has slammed the EPA for the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule that requires 27 states including Texas to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that contribute to ozone and/or fine-particle pollution in other states. Perry seems unaware that our state is at the top of the worst list in a number of categories, including No. 1 in the United States for carbon dioxide emissions. If Texas were a nation, it would rank 8th in the world for CO2 emissions. Texas also leads the nation in generating hazardous waste and is well known as a hazardous waste dump for our country. Our Texas Gulf Coast city of Port Arthur has received the Army's VX nerve gas waste product and incinerated it at the Veolia waste treatment facility. A paper company's waste pits, hidden in sand dunes under water for many years, contaminated the San Jacinto River and much of Galveston Bay with high levels of dioxin before anyone knew it was there. With Perry's support, the dumping gets more dangerous. The Texas Legislature this year approved a radioactive waste facility that will receive nuclear waste from all across the nation. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) is building the facility in Andrews County, dangerously close to the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest aquifer in the world. By the way, WCS happens to be owned by Harold Simmons, who donated $1.12 million to Perry's campaign, according to a 2010 report by Texans for Public Justice. Perry ignores reality. Texas has literally been on fire in a summer of extreme drought and record-breaking heat, yet our governor continues to deny that global warming exists. He criticizes the EPA and suggests that we pray for rain. The governor loudly boasts about jobs in Texas. Does he know anything about solutions that could really help the environment and our economy, like green jobs? Does he know or care that more than 60 percent of Americans think that public investment should go to create clean energy jobs? If we continue business as usual under people like Rick Perry, we will not be able to protect the health of citizens, the environment or the economy. Please, do your research. Get to know the records and platforms of presidential candidates. Look at how the real issues like health, the environment, education, as well as the economy, affect your life. And please get involved in the American political system before it is too late. Owen is president and founder of Houston-based Citizens League for Environmental Action Now (CLEAN) www.cleanhouston.org, an organization that works to educate the public about solutions to environmental issues.

Traffic is up along most of the roads in the South Texas Eagle Ford Shale play. The demand for water to supply frack wells in South Texas is so great some companies have looked at using treated sewage from San Antonio. With the oil and gas play generating $25 billion in 2011, according to a University of Texas at San Antonio study, water costs have not been a major hurdle — yet. But while the new drain on water supplies and the ability of the drilling companies to pay almost any price concern those dependent on currently inexpensive ground water, the total water used for fracking is dwarfed by agricultural use, explained Mike Mahoney, general manager of the Evergreen Underground Water Districts, which manages the groundwater below four counties south of San Antonio and in the center of the Eagle Ford play. Late summer is the prime peanut growing season in South Texas. If the region does not receive decent rains, farmers will be dependent on groundwater sources, which is the same source of water for the fracking wells. Just a couple of good rainstorms that would allow farmers to stop irrigation for a week would more than offset the pumping done for fracking, Mahoney said. So the bigger concern about water supply for Mahoney is when the current two-year-long drought is going to end. The issue with fracking and protecting water supply is making sure there is safe disposal of the dangerous chemicals the companies use. “Where they are fracking is close to a mile below any freshwater, and any chance of that frack water coming is about nil,” Mahoney said. “But surface contamination is always a different story. You never know what can happen there.” So far, the drought has not limited fracking, and San Antonio has not sold sewage. But droughts in Texas have lasted for decades or more, and this is only year two. cmcdonald@express-news.net

url: https://www.lakecountystar.com/news/article/Mystery-of-how-a-tiger-caught-covid-19-has-15187664.php
 Darryl Fears, The Washington Post It's been a vexing question since the day Nadia the tiger was spotted dry coughing and wheezing in her enclosure at the Bronx Zoo. How in the world did the 4-year-old Malayan tiger contract covid-19, the virus that has infected about 1.4 million humans? Nadia is terribly unlucky - the first confirmed case of a wild or domestic animal to come down with the disease. Her unlikely infection raised questions about whether humans can pass coronavirus to their house pets. Zookeepers think Nadia got it from a human. But that's an educated guess. In an interview Tuesday, Paul Calle, the zoo's chief veterinarian, said they have no idea which human might have done it. "No one who has worked with these cats has been tested and is positive," Calle said. As experts scratched their heads in New York, a study released Tuesday by the University of California at Davis explored a broader problem related to human contact with wildlife. Manipulation of the environment by humankind, the study said, has made deadly pandemics inevitable. Hunting and domesticating wildlife, and also invading their habitats, allows the viruses animals carry to spill over, and - as Nadia's infection suggests - vice versa. Gaming and farming brings people in direct contact with disease, while the destruction of wild habitats through urban and agricultural development sends wild mammals scurrying to areas where humans live, according to the study published in Royal Society Proceedings B. "Deforestation, open crop fields - what we're doing is causing wildlife to adapt to that," said Christine Kreuder Johnson, a professor of epidemiology at UC-Davis and the study's lead author. Typically wildlife populations decline because of human activity, but a few of them actually grow. Out of thousands of mammals studied, the report found 58 species that increased their populations when humans altered their environments. "It's mostly rodents," Johnson said. "Some species of bats." It was a key finding when it comes to coronavirus. Scientists still don't know what animal the novel coronavirus occupied before it made the jump into its first human victim in Wuhan, China. The "reservoir" population, where the virus is endemic, is almost certainly some kind of bat. Scientists have identified more than 200 coronaviruses in more than 1,000 bat species. Wet markets are where a wide variety of live animals are sold and consumed, and some in Wuhan consider bats a delicacy. Genetic analyses suggest the coronavirus, officially SARS-CoV-2, is most genetically similar to a germ found in an endangered scaly anteater called a pangolin. Some scientists have theorized pangolins traded on the illegal wildlife market were an intermediate host that allowed the virus to infect humans. "Until we find a virus in a host that pretty unambiguously looks like a recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, we may never know for sure," said Tom Friedrich, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin. "There may even be more than one." The animal world is rife with viruses - at least 320,000 kinds are known to infect mammals alone. Through habitat fragmentation, pollution and climate change, humans have created the conditions for those viruses to flourish. In a study published Wednesday in the journal Science, a team of researchers from China reported that domestic cats can become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and can even contract the virus through the air. The virus settles in cats' nasal passages, trachea and lungs. "Surveillance . . . in cats should be considered as an adjunct to elimination of covid-19 in humans," the researchers wrote. They also studied ferrets, dogs, picks, chickens and ducks. Of those, only ferrets were susceptible to the disease. It's still rare, and a bit weird, that the coronavirus spilled from an animal to a human and then somehow back to a third animal. On March 27, Nadia was seen coughing in her exhibit for the first time. By then the zoo had been closed 11 days. The next week her sister, Azul, two Amur tigers, and three African lions in a different facility looked sick. In a city that has become the epicenter of the outbreak in America, staff immediately suspected the coronavirus. But they had to prove it. Nadia was tranquilized with a low-weight dart on Thursday at her exhibit to allow a team of about six veterinarians and staff to gather around her. They conducted an ultrasound and extracted blood for tests. "We wanted to rule out all the obvious causes," Calle said. "With what's going on in New York City with covid, we wanted that examination as well." Because so many sick humans are waiting to be tested amid an equipment shortage in New York, Calle felt obligated to explain that Nadia's test was specifically designed for felines. "There's no competition for tests," he said. Nadia's samples were sent to two veterinarian schools, at Cornell University and the University of Illinois, and also to the Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories, which confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19 in humans. "This is the first instance of a tiger being infected with covid-19," the lab said in a statement. The zoo's other big cats weren't tested because tranquilizing animals involves risk. Based on Nadia's test, Calle said it's assumed they too have the coronavirus. In addition to tigers in public zoos, humans operate private zoos and wildlife sanctuaries with large cats, such as the free wheeling Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park of Oklahoma featured in the popular Netflix show, "Tiger King." There have been no reports of feline covid infection at private zoos and sanctuaries. The cats infected at the Bronx Zoo are expected to recover. But a question remains: If a zookeeper or some other employee can infect a tiger, can people infect their house cats? "I'm very suspicious this virus can be transmitted to cats from infected people," Johnson said. "It's a concern. It's not a concern from a human risk perspective. . . . We need to be careful not to transmit disease to animals." To jump between species, the virus has to find a way to attach to the cell of a new host. It does that by binding to the receptors in cells. Receptors the coronavirus uses to attach to human cells are similar to the receptors it uses to attach to cat cells, Johnson said. Nadia's infection was concerning enough for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians to issue joint guidance for zoos to consider giving more personal protection equipment to animal care staffers who work with cats, "including coveralls, surgical masks, eye protection and gloves." It also asked zoos to consider limiting access to enclosures and "immediately report anything that is unusual in the health of any of the animals." News of Nadia's infection just happened to coincide with the release of the study. Johnson and her co-authors, including Tierra Smiley Evans and Pranav S. Pandit at UC-Davis, set out to advance the understanding of how people can reduce their risk of disease emergence five years ago. Previous research didn't ask an important question. "People show up with zoonotic diseases, and they're not asked, 'how did you get this?' There was a concern about how little is reported out in the literature," Johnson said. "This is an unprecedented situation we're in, and I think we have to take unprecedented measures to head this off." The researchers concluded that humans need to find a better way to coexist with nature and reconsider the explosion of development that began in the 1940s. The coronavirus outbreak is an indication of the risks people are taking, the study said. "It could be worse," Johnson said. "Nature is going to determine how long we exist here. We need to understand the implications of this for our own survival." - - - The Washington Post's Sarah Kaplan contributed to this report Read More Coughing tiger at the Bronx Zoo tests positive for coronavirus, a 'first case of its kind' in U.S. Next pandemic is already coming unless humans change how we interact with wildlife, scientists say The coronavirus pandemic has halted tourism, and animals are benefiting from it Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.

url: https://www.lakecountystar.com/seattlenews/article/Criminal-investigation-into-Duwamish-River-5783760.php
 By Levi Pulkkinen, SeattlePI An eight-year investigation that saw divers sneak water monitoring equipment into the drain of a South Seattle cement plant quietly ended with a fine and no criminal prosecution. Workers at the investigation’s target – a cement plant on the Duwamish River – were suspected of illegally pouring waste into the river, which runs through Seattle's Industrial District separating West Seattle from the rest of the city. Criminal investigators with the Environmental Protection Agency took the unusual step of hiding water quality sampling equipment inside a 32-inch drainpipe thought at the Lafarge North America plant. Agents obtained a warrant similar to those required to wiretap suspects and discovered “spikes” in pollution emanating for the facility, which wasn’t supposed to be dumping anything at all. Ultimately, Lafarge North America managers and the EPA resolved the claims through a $300,000 fine for dumping water soiled at the plant into the Duwamish, violating federal law and further polluting the already tainted river. That settlement, brought about following out-of-court negotiations between EPA and the cement maker, is currently being reviewed by a federal judge in Seattle. The cement kiln and some operations at Lafarge’s West Marginal Way facility have been curtailed since the investigation began, though cement processing continues at the site. Jonathan Hall, operations manager at the facility, said water handling at the facility has been improved since the violations were discovered. “Managing stormwater is an evolution,” Hall said. “One of the things we strive for is being a facility that the regulators are impressed with” while staying financially viable, he continued. “We want to continue to develop our green footprint.” Investigators’ interest in the Lafarge plant dates to 2006, when a tipster reported workers there were secretly dumping “chemical waste” into the Duwamish. EPA divers working as part of a criminal investigation inserted monitoring equipment into an outfall pipe at the facility three years later in an effort to corroborate that claim. It’s unclear whether those allegations proved out. No criminal prosecutions followed the investigation, and the pending settlement between EPA and Lafarge likely means none are planned. The $300,000 fine “was determined to be an appropriate penalty based on … the EPA’s long-standing settlement policy,” EPA spokesman Mark MacIntyre said Friday. MacIntyre declined to comment on the criminal investigation or elaborate on its outcome. Lafarge was found to have been illegally dumping soiled water into the Duwamish at the facility, located just more than 2 miles from the heavily polluted river’s outlet into Puget Sound. The Duwamish itself is a Superfund site due to pollution left behind generations of industrial activity near the heavily managed river’s mouth. EPA investigators concluded that Lafarge had been violating the Clean Water Act, which regulates polluting discharges into American waters. High among the pollution sources regulated by the Clean Water Act is runoff from industrial facilities. Such discharges flowed through the Lafarge plant into the Duwamish without treatment, contrary to permits issued to the plant. The 22-acre waterfront facility, located at 5400 W. Marginal Way S.W., had manufactured Portland cement since 1967. Until recently, workers made cement clinker by melting limestone, sand, iron and clay in a large kiln at the plant, which was built to produce 490,000 tons of cement annually. Lafarge bought the plant in 1998 and has run it since. Now employing about 30 workers, the plant’s workforce was halved four years ago when the kiln was shutdown. Hall said the down economy, new air pollution regulations and other factors prompted the kiln closure. The facility was built with a stormwater catch system designed to collect any rain or wastewater; the water was then used in cement production, during which some is steamed away. The closed system was made to hold more than 2 million gallons of water. When that ran low, Lafarge bought more from the city of Seattle. Rain passing through the site was only to be poured into the Duwamish during unusually heavy storms. Even then, Lafarge was only permitted to dump treated stormwater into the Duwamish. Water used in cement making was not to be discharged under any circumstance. As it turned out, investigators found the plant regularly dumped both substances – potentially tainted rainwater, and certainly tainted wastewater – into the Duwamish for years. As early as May 2006, a joint inspection of the site by Washington Department of Ecology and Seattle Public Utilities revealed that a variety of violations related to discharges from the site. “Inspectors documented significant sediment accumulation in catch basins, material spilled around the dock, and uncovered fuel drums stored outdoors without containment,” EPA attorney Deanna Chang said in court papers. Most concerning, inspectors found untreated stormwater was gushing into the Duwamish from one of the facility’s three large outfall pipes, continued Chang, an attorney assigned to the Department of Justice’s environmental division. Three years later, untreated water – some of which had been used to clean a large slurry tank – was still spewing from the plant. Pumps meant to handle the water were clogged with sediment, and alarms meant to sound when discharges occurred stayed silent. At the time, the plant received barge loads of coal, which were hoisted onto a dock at the facility for use in cement making. In visits to the facility, inspectors also saw coal spilled on the facility dock and into the river, sheen on the Duwamish emanating from the plant, iron slag spilling onto a river bank, and a leaking oil tank spilling freely. Lafarge was cited by the Department of Ecology in September 2009 for dumping polluted water, as well as failing to store chemicals or handle wastewater properly. The following month, a special agent with the EPA’s criminal investigations division swore an affidavit detailing reports that chemical waste brought to the facility was being dumped through the stormwater system. According to special agent’s statement, the criminal investigation had been launched in July 2009 following reports from inspectors of unauthorized dumping into the Duwamish. Questioned by inspectors, a Lafarge environmental engineer couldn’t explain why the dumping was occurring. Inspectors saw Lafarge employees washing large slurry tanks with fire hoses, breaking off pieces of cement waste stuck to the sides of the tanks, the special agent said in court papers. Water from the tanks appeared to be making its way to the Duwamish – entirely untreated – through the plant’s water system. The EPA special agent noted Lafarge had promised to fix problems with the waste system when first confronted by Department of Ecology inspectors in 2006. That same year, an EPA hotline received an anonymous complaint that chemical waste was being stored in the Lafarge retention pond now dumping into the Duwamish. The informant claimed “most of the releases occur during the night” so that no oily sheen would be seen on the water, according to the special agent’s 2009 affidavit. “This practice has been ongoing for at least seven months and has been kept quiet among the workers,” the informant told investigators. Those claims have not resulted in criminal prosecution, nor are they mentioned in the civil lawsuit filed earlier in September by EPA. EPA special agents began staking out the facility in August 2009, watching intermittently from a boat moored in the Duwamish. Investigators soon realized they wouldn’t be able to see all discharges because the outfall pipe at issue is underwater at high tide. Having obtained a warrant authorizing the secret monitoring, EPA divers placed the equipment in the drain pipe on Oct. 14, 2009. Writing the court, the special agent that secrecy might require “night operations.” Investigators returned in mid-November to collect the monitoring equipment, which had been taking water samples every 30 seconds for 27 days. They found “spikes” in pollution corresponding with high tides, during which the pipe was submerged. The pollution found in the pipe was uncharacteristic for the Duwamish River, the special agent said, and could be evidence of illegal discharges from the Lafarge plant. Lafarge managers weren’t told of the intrusion by EPA for two months due to concerns held by investigators that doing so might spoil their work. “Personnel and contractors working at the Lafarge facility could destroy and/or tamper with … records and data storage devices if notification of the warrant authorizing placement and use of the sampling device is required immediately,” the special agent said in court papers. A year after the surreptitious monitoring, Lafarge stopped making cement at the facility and shuttered the cement kiln. Cement from elsewhere is still processed and packed at the facility, which earlier this year sprinkled neighbors with cement dust after a containment system failed. Due to the change in operations the plant uses much less water, and the restrictions on how water is handled at the site have been relaxed. The facility is now among the region’s top sources for low-CO2 cement, a material that requires less energy to produce, Hall said. Most of the cement produced at the plant now is made of recycled ingredients or leftovers from iron manufacturing. Hall described his facility’s more ecologically friendly products as being a key piece of the “green building” movement. “We’re proud to be part of that, and proud to be part of a facility that allows us to do that,” said Hall, who went to work at the site 3 ½ years ago, after most of the dumping at issue in the EPA action occurred. EPA and Lafarge ultimately agreed the company would pay $300,000 to settle the allegations. The settlement agreement was filed last week in U.S. District Court in Seattle, and will become final if District Judge John Cougenour signs off on it in coming days as expected.
