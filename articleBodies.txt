 Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. A couple hundred Madison Heights area residents applauded several times Monday night as they learned of actions taken since a green ooze on I-696 revealed toxic contamination leaking from the former Electro-Plating Services site on 10 Mile Road. But some still have questions with no quick answers, including about whether the pollution will affect their property values. No contamination in Warren drains from green ooze, mayor says Whitmer considers more criminal charges in 'green ooze' pollution case One of the most surprising facts to come out Monday is that Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has an annual budget of only $15 million and there are 9,000 contaminated sites in southeast Michigan. The cleanup in Madison Heights is expected to cost in “the low millions” of dollars, said Tracy Keoskemeti EGLE, and the agency doesn’t have the money. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter said he was shocked to learn of the low funding level. Money is needed to tear down the three Electro-Plating Services buildings and clean up the site. Madison Heights awaits EPA timeline for cleanup of contaminated site near I-696 David Coulter calls green ooze situation a 'catastrophe' in testimony to lawmakers “I’ve promised the county will help provide the resources to tear down that building,” Coulter said. “We’re not going to let demolition costs be an impediment to the cleanup.” Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. U.S. Rep. Andy Levin said reform laws are needed so that polluters have to pay for their actions. “We have to fully fund EPA to go after corporate polluters,” he said. “We’ve got to do better.” Soil, groundwater and vapor samples thus far have not indicated contamination spreading beyond the site and immediate surroundings, according to the Environmental Protection Agency and EGLE. Testing and test results are continuing, Keoskemeti said. The ooze that spread onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20 did get into the stormwater system and Bear Creek, both of which ultimately reach Lake St. Clair. Oakland County identifies seven contaminated sites in need of assessment Testing for toxic waste from Madison Heights site expands to Hazel Park State says "green ooze" not impacting drinking water However, the contaminants were diluted enough by the time they reached the lake that it is not expected to impact water quality, Keoskemeti said, adding samplings done at seven water plants on the lake and St. Clair River have shown no effect. City, county and state elected officials were on hand at Madison High School as representatives from the EPA, EGLE and the state Department of Health and Human Services updated residents with a briefing and answered written questions. “It was like a chemical hoarding situation,” Keoskemeti said, describing conditions inside the plant where over 5,000 chemical containers, a number of them leaking or degrading, were found inside the facility in 2017 during an initial EPA cleanup and criminal investigation. The site failed to qualify for EPA Superfund status and funding because there was no threat to drinking water and it was estimated there was a low risk of contaminates spreading from the site. The EPA cleanup nearly three years ago was done to remove the immediate hazard, Keoskemeti said, and no soil or groundwater testing was done. The site was then turned over to EGLE. EPA, other officials to brief area residents on toxic Madison Heights site Monday Owner Gary Sayers is serving a one-year federal prison sentence and has to pay $1.5 million for demolition of his three buildings at 945 E. 10 Mile Road. The city is suing him for the costs to tear down the derelict structures on his site in a civil trial that is continuing this week in Oakland County Circuit Court. State Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office and the environmental agencies are looking to see whether there are more actions they can take against Sayers. City and state officials said drinking water is unaffected and there appears to be no soil pollution beyond the former plating company site. “There’s no reason to believe contaminated groundwater has moved to the neighborhoods,” Keoskemeti said. “It’s really localized around that site.” Green liquid that leaked from a pit Sayers had dug beneath the basement was found to include toxins such as hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent, cyanide, trichloroethylene, and PFAS. Two Madison Heights residents – Jennifer Zmarzlik and Amy Lewis – have started a Facebook group called Madison Heights Clean-up, and a website, madisonheightscleanup.eco. They have researched available EPA, EGLE and other public information to inform fellow residents. Zmarzlik credited city officials with successfully pushing for action. She acknowledged being angry when she first learned of the pollution. “I feel as if we are being heard,” she said. “Fear of the unknown can create an atmosphere of negativity. We wanted to give people empowerment” with quick access to information. Three sump pumps run around the clock in the pit of the former plating building, an interceptor trench outside the building, and on the embankment to I-696, said Tricia Edwards of the EPA. More than 63,000 gallons of contaminated water has been pumped into massive frac tanks for disposal. Information on environmental remediation and updates is available online at the EPA’s website at epa.gov/mi/electro-plating-services-i696-release-site, and EGLE’s site at electro-plating services/ I-696 incident.

 As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA worked to clean up chemicals that leaked from a former Electro-Plating Service building onto the eastbound shoulder in Madison Heights several days before Christmas. The cleanup work and analysis continues and EPA and state EGLE officials are updating area residents at a public meeting Monday. As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA worked to clean up chemicals that leaked from a former Electro-Plating Service building onto the eastbound shoulder in Madison Heights several days before Christmas. The cleanup work and analysis continues and EPA and state EGLE officials are updating area residents at a public meeting Monday. Experts from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy are set to meet with Madison Heights area residents to answer questions about the contaminated Electro-Plating Services site. The meeting is at 6 p.m. Monday at the Madison Heights High School, 915 E. 11 Mile Road. State Rep. Jim Ellison and other city, county, state and national officials, including U.S Rep. Andy Levin, said they are attending the meeting. “People from the EPA and EGLE are going to update the community on what they’ve found at the site and how long it’s going to take to clean it up,” Ellison said. “There are a lot of fingers being pointed now, which is counterproductive. We’ll have plenty of time to find the cause and who did what, but we want the cleanup first.” Gary Sayers, owner of the plating company that included three rundown buildings at 945. E. 10 Mile, began serving a one-year federal prison term last month. He was also fined $1.5 million to pay EPA costs at his buildings incurred before a toxic green substance leaked onto I-696 near his building Dec. 20, requiring more cleanup efforts. Meantime, Madison Heights is suing Sayers in Oakland County Circuit Court to pay demolition and cleanup costs for his three buildings. “People are angry, and understandably so,” Ellison said. “This is just one of 7,000 contaminated sites in the state. The primary task is to get it cleaned up and get the money to pay for it.” The state Legislature is set to introduce legislation Monday aimed at making it easier to enforce cleanup fines and penalties against environmental polluters. Ellison and Madison Heights Mayor Brian Hartwell said EGLE and EPA officials have been responsive and updated elected and other officials with weekly meetings since Dec. 20. The green viscous liquid from the site that oozed I-696 was found to contain hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent, cyanide, and trichloroethylene. “I have a lot of trust in the state officials because they are being honest and have worked with us since this problem bubbled up, so to speak,” Hartwell said. The mayor’s campaign committee recently paid to mail EPA and EGLE updates on the contaminated site to a couple thousand residents who live in the area. The EPA several days ago said it has taken 29 soil samples and 33 groundwater samples from temporary monitoring wells. No traces of pollutants exceeding metrics for safe levels were found in the groundwater samples. Data on soil samples is pending, according to the EPA. The contaminants have no effect on local drinking water or soil beyond the site area, city officials said. EPA workers have collected more than 48,000 gallons of liquid from storm drains, anon-site monitoring well and the basement of the former plating company. Funding for cleaning up polluted sites like the former Electro-Plating location is a major hurdle, Harwell added. “Even if they hired 100 new site inspectors today there would still be a backlog,” he said. Records show Sayers received 15 warnings or violations from environmental officials for operations at his plant starting over two decades ago. There were also subsequent court orders against him and several informant complaints before he was finally charged and convicted in U.S District Court in Detroit last year. Federal prosecutors said Sayers illegally stored thousands of containers of hazardous waste rather than disposing of them legally. He also stored toxic waste in a five-foot-deep pit dug beneath the floor of the basement, prosecutors said. Pollutants from that pit are what mixed with rain and ground water before seeping out onto the shoulder of eastbound I-696 shortly before Christmas. The property was declared a Superfund site by the EPA and a first cleanup was completed in early 2018. Other officials at Monday’s meeting will include State Sen. Jeremy Moss, Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter, county Water Resources Commissioner Jim Nash, Oakland County Commissioner Gary McGillivray of Madison Heights, and representatives from the state Department of Health and Human Services. EPA and EGLE representatives will answer questions from residents after their presentation. “I think the majority of questions will be about exposure to chemicals and soil contamination, said Madison Heights City Manager Melissa Marsh. “Residents have asked the city those questions and also about the EPA and EGLE and why (the site) wasn't inspected more. This meeting is a chance for residents to turn out in a united front and show that we want this site cleaned up.” Here is a look at some of the stories you may have missed from the past week:

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) FILE - In this Jan. 22, 2020, file photo, President Donald Trump leaves after a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It's been a week packed with rhetoric from President Donald Trump. This, as his Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, played out. An AP Fact Check put his statements under scrutiny and found distortions on a range of topics. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON>> Abroad, at home and in Twitter's ether, President Donald Trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the Davos economic forum played out in Switzerland. On impeachment, the state of the country, abortion, pollution and more, Trump didn't tell the story straight. A week in review: MISSILE ATTACK TRUMP, on U.S. troops targeted by the Iranian missile attack in Iraq this month: "I heard they had headaches and a couple of other things ... and I can report it is not very serious. ... No, I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I've seen. ... No, I do not consider that to be bad injuries, no." — news conference Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland. THE FACTS: That assurance is misleading at best. The Pentagon said Friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to Germany or back to the U.S. for further observation and treatment. Traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life-long debilitation or death. The severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the Pentagon; evaluation of the wounded troops continues. In the first few days after the attacks, Trump inaccurately told the nation that no American service members were hurt. ___ ABORTION TRUMP on Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va.: "The governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth." — remarks at anti-abortion rally Friday. THE FACTS: No, Northam he didn't. Trump routinely twists Northam's words, which were convoluted to begin with. Noting that late-term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive, Northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered. Then, he said, the baby would be "resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue" between doctors and the mother about what to do. In extremely rare instances, babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion. "Execution" is not an option. When a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth, a family may choose what's known as palliative care or comfort care. This might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention. Providing comfort without life-extending treatment is not specific to newborns. It may happen with fatally ill patients of any age. ___ BLUE-COLLAR 'BOOM' TRUMP: "This is a blue-collar boom. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus-47% -- three times faster than the increase for the top 1%." — remarks in Davos on Tuesday. THE FACTS: It isn't a boom for blue-collar workers. They haven't done much better than everyone else, and some of their gains under Trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing. The mining and logging industry, for example, which includes oil and gas workers, lost 21,000 jobs last year. Manufacturers have added just 9,000 jobs in the past six months, while the economy as a whole gained more than 1.1 million jobs during that period. The U.S. economy is still heavily oriented toward services. While factory jobs have grown, other jobs have grown faster, so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since Trump took office. He's right that net worth among the bottom half has risen, but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed. The Federal Reserve says the bottom half has just 1.6% of the nation's wealth, compared with 1.1% when Trump took office. It was 2.1% in 2006. ___ TRUMP: "For the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. We are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: That's not true. Wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few: The richest 1% of Americans own 32% of the nation's wealth, about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated. The middle-class share — defined by the Fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10% — remains at about 29%. This, despite the slight gains of the bottom half. The percentage of Americans who own their own homes, a key source of wealth-building, has improved modestly under Trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013. ___ OCEAN DEBRIS TRUMP: "We have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. ... We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean, where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us, and that's put there by other countries." — Davos news conference Wednesday. THE FACTS: He's right that garbage from abroad has come to U.S. shores by sea. What he does not say is that garbage from the U.S. also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that Americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores. Debris from Asia was most noticeable after the 2011 Japanese tsunami, said marine debris expert Kara Lavender Law of the Sea Education Association, "but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the U.S. and washing ashore in Asia." In fact, she said, most debris is not tracked to the country of origin. The United States produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight, Law said. "Most debris we find on the coast of the U.S. is likely from the U.S.," Denise Hardesty, a scientist who researches ocean trash for Australia's federal science organization, said by email. ___ IMPEACHMENT and UKRAINE TRUMP, on military aid to Ukraine: "Remember this, they got their money and they got it early." — interview Wednesday with Fox Business Network. TRUMP: "They got their money long before schedule." — Davos news conference. THE FACTS: They got the money months late. Congress approved nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in the early months of 2019. U.S. officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that Trump had ordered the assistance to held back, as he pressed Ukraine to announce an investigation of Democrats. It was released Sept. 11, only after a whistleblower's complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine had surfaced and a few days after Democrats in Congress opened the investigation. Previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted. ___ TRUMP, on Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the lead impeachment manager for the Senate trial: "He makes a statement that I made, and it was a total fraud. I never made it. That's why I released the conversation, because if I didn't release it, people would have said that I made the statement that he made. This guy is a fraud." — Fox interview Wednesday. THE FACTS: No, Schiff spoke after Trump released the rough transcript of his July phone call, not before. Trump's claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue. The White House released the account of the conversation on Sept. 25. Schiff gave his account on Sept. 26, while leading a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the matter, as the committee chairman. Trump has made much of Schiff's account, seizing on how the Democrat put words in Trump's mouth in describing the president's conversation with Ukraine's leader. Schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally. He said he was characterizing Trump's conversation "in not so many words," attempting to describe "the essence" of it, and doing something of a "parody." Schiff based his account on the rough transcript. He did not cause it to be released. ___ TRUMP LAWYER JAY SEKULOW, on special counsel Robert Mueller: "We had the invocation of the ghost of the Mueller report. I know something about that report. It came up empty on the issue of collusion with Russia. There was no obstruction, in fact." — impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: He's wrong to suggest that Mueller's report cleared the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia. Nor did the report exonerate Trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice. Instead, the report factually laid out instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, leaving it open for Congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once Trump leaves office. "If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so," Mueller said after the report was released. Mueller's two-year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with Russians. Among them: Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. On collusion, Mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term. He looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front. ___ SEKULOW: "During the proceedings that took place before the Judiciary Committee, the president was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses. The president was denied the right to access evidence. And the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings." — impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's false. The committee, which produced the articles of impeachment, invited Trump or his legal team to come. He declined. Absent White House representation, the hearings proceeded as things in Congress routinely do. Time was split between Democratic and Republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate. Lawyers for Democrats and Republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses, among them an academic called forward by Republicans. The first round of hearings was by the House Intelligence Committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases, conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation. Trump cried foul then at the lack of representation, then rejected representation when the next committee offered it. ___ BLACK COLLEGES TRUMP, on historically black colleges and universities: "I saved HBCUs. We saved them. They were going out and we saved them." — Davos remarks Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's a big stretch. Trump signed a law in December restoring money that lapsed for several months when Congress failed to reauthorize some $255 million in financing on time. The money came back because Senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools. Neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the Trump administration. The administration generally has supported historically black colleges, as previous administrations have done, and it's true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed. The Trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes. But this segment of university education was not vanishing. ___ AIR & WATER TRUMP: "I'm proud to report the United States has among the cleanest air and drinking water on Earth -- and we're going to keep it that way. And we just came out with a report that, at this moment, it's the cleanest it's been in the last 40 years." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, air quality has worsened under his administration. And it's a stretch to say the U.S. is among the countries with the cleanest air. Dozens of nations have less smoggy air. In the U.S. and other countries, air is better than it was during the days of full-on coal power, leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks, before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago. But by multiple measures, air quality has deteriorated in the last few years. Trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean-up of U.S. air and water a half-century ago. As to water quality, one measure, Yale University's global Environmental Performance Index, finds the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water. But after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled. There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, according to an Associated Press analysis of EPA data. And deadly air particle pollution increased 5.5% in the U.S. between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24% from 2009 to 2016, says a Carnegie Mellon University study. The Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days. ___ ECONOMY TRUMP: "We have the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country. And I'm in Europe today because we're bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs -- millions of jobs, in many cases. " — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: His persistent depiction of the U.S. economy as the greatest ever is false. As for jobs pouring into the country, investment by foreign companies has slumped under Trump, according to a report by the Organization for International Investment, a Washington-based association that represents foreign businesses. Foreign companies directly invested $268 billion into the U.S. economy in 2018, a decrease of nearly $220 billion from its record-breaking level in 2016 when Democrat Barack Obama was still president. On the broader picture, economic growth under Trump is not nearly the greatest ever. In the late 1990s, growth topped 4% for four straight years, a level it has not reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth reached 7.2% in 1984. The economy grew 2.9% in 2018 — the same pace it reached in 2015 under Obama — and hasn't hit historically high growth rates. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low of 3.5%, but the proportion of Americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s. Wages were rising at a faster pace back then, too. This much is true: The Obama-Trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. But not the greatest. ___ TRUMP: "The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any U.S. president in recorded history. We started off with a reasonably high rate." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Actually, Trump started with a rate that, if anything, was reasonably low, not "reasonably high." The unemployment rate was 4.7% when Trump replaced Obama in the White House. That is below the long-term U.S. average unemployment of 5.7% since the Labor Department began compiling the data in 1948. Obama inherited a rate of 7.8%. It remained high for years -- topping 8% for a record length of time -- but gradually fell to the below-average level Trump inherited. ___ TRADE TRUMP: "Just last week alone, the United States concluded two extraordinary trade deals — the agreement with China and the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement — the two biggest trade deals ever made." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, there have been larger trade deals. For instance, 123 countries signed the Uruguay Round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the World Trade Organization in 1994. The organization's initial membership accounted for more than 90% of global economic output, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found, and that was before China joined the organization. Also bigger: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have joined North America with Pacific Rim countries in freer trade. Trump took the U.S. out after the deal was negotiated and before the U.S. ratified it. The European Union, with its liberalized trade regimen, was itself formed from a giant deal. The China deal leaves tariffs in place on about $360 billion in imports from China and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations. Trump's U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement is much larger, though it's an update of the long-standing North American Free Trade Agreement worked out by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. ___ HOUSEHOLD INCOME TRUMP: "Real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Not really, but it would be misleading even if it were true. Real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of $63,200 first reached in 1999. That's according to adjusted figures the Census Bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time. Trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record. Either way, what the data show is that income for the median household — the one at the exact middle of the income distribution — essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years. The Census data also show that household income fell sharply after the Great Recession, then began rebounding in 2015, before Trump took office. WASHINGTON>> President Donald Trump systematically fabricated his record before boisterous supporters and the eyes of the world this past week.

 The Oakland County Brownfield Consortium has identified this property, located at 30250 Grand River Avenue, in Farmington Hills, as one of seven that needs to be assessed for potential contamination in the current fiscal year. Environmental concerns include petroleum products from a leaking underground storage tank and hazardous substances from former auto repair use. @MarkCavitt on Twitter The Oakland County Brownfield Consortium has identified this property, located at 30250 Grand River Avenue, in Farmington Hills, as one of seven that needs to be assessed for potential contamination in the current fiscal year. Environmental concerns include petroleum products from a leaking underground storage tank and hazardous substances from former auto repair use. The Oakland County Brownfield Consortium is seeking $600,000 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to help assess contaminated properties. The Fiscal Year 2020 EPA Assessment Coalition grant would be used to conduct assessments of some of the county's most polluted properties, often referred to as brownfields. More than 1,000 of these properties are located within the county with many of them located along three corridors including 8 Mile, John R., and Telegraph roads. Some of these vacant sites include remnants of manufacturing facilities that were once reliant on the automotive industry, but closed during the recession. Other sites, which housed gas stations, auto repair shops, and car dealerships have challenged local governments to find creative uses that will foster economic growth. Brad Hansen, the county's brownfield program manager, said the grant funding is used to conduct environmental site investigations and baseline environmental assessments. "These dollars are used for environmental testing, not remediation, to determine what contaminants are on the sites, if any," he said. "The grant will also be used to look into the history of the property and its neighbors to see if there any reason to be concerned. We target these three areas because, historically, they've had some contamination. We have a pretty good belief that many of the properties are contaminated." In 2009, Oakland County created the consortium to attract federal dollars to help communities assess and clean up the polluted sites while fostering economic growth. The consortium is comprised of the county and six communities including Farmington Hills, Pontiac, Ferndale, Hazel Park, Southfield, and Farmington Hills. Oakland County Executive David Coulter said all legal remedies should be used against a local business owner cited for causing an environmenta… FY 2020 Oakland County EPA Assessment Coalition Grant The county's target areas for assessment include: In November, the coalition met to discuss the county's current inventory of brownfield properties, evaluate additional properties for inclusion, and prioritize the sites for assessment. As part of this process, Hansen said each of the six coalition communities nominate a brownfield property that may be of concern to residents. "These sites are an idea of what the money could be used for," he said. "Just because these sites are identified on the grant application, that doesn't mean we have to spend money on them. If there isn't a prime reason to spend money on a site, we may not do it. If a community definitely wants to get a site taken care of, it's going to be a top priority for us here at the county." Here's a list of the priority brownfield sites identified by the coalition for Fiscal Year 2020: Last week, Oakland County Executive David Coulter testified before the House Appropriations Committee in Lansing. The testimony was focused on how the county will work with local, state, and federal officials to comprehensively remediate the "green ooze" chemical spill originating from defunct Electro-Plating Services, located in Madison Heights along 10 Mile just south of I-696. Local, state, and federal officials will host a public briefing to discuss the "green ooze" spill from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 5, at Madison High School, 915 E. 11 Mile Road.

Contamination from the "green ooze" spill is not impacting drinking water. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) reported that preliminary test results indicate that contamination from the polluted Madison Heights Electro-Plating Services facility are neither impacting groundwater nor moving southward from the site. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tested groundwater from south of E. 10 Mile Road in Hazel Park, the opposite direction from the I-696 freeway embankment where contaminants were discovered seeping onto the shoulder Dec. 20. Those tests detected no trichlorethylene (TCE) and no hexavalent chromium, the chemicals found in the "green ooze." Results of soil samples taken from the same locations are pending.

Testing from the toxic Electro-Plating Services site in Madison Height expanded into Hazel Park this week. Additionally, water systems that draw their water from Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River, downstream from the contamination, have tested their water as a precaution. They show levels of hexavalent chromium, the chemical that gave the highway liquid its green color, less than 1/1,000th of the drinking water standard. On Friday morning, test results from the Madison Heights municipal water system showed no contaminants exceeding drinking water standards, a consultant for the city reported. Tests from other water systems are pending. The EPA has launched an interactive map that displays preliminary test results for trichlorethylene (TCE), hexavalent chromium, and cyanide. The map will continue to be updated as new sampling becomes available. The public is invited to attend a community briefing, being held from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Madison High School, 915 E. 11 Mile Rd, on Monday, Feb. 3. Local, state, and federal officials will update residents on the "green ooze" situation. The event is hosted by Oakland County Executive David Coulter, Congressman Andy Levin, State Rep. Jim Ellison, State Sen. Jeremy Moss.

He spoke about the toxic chemical spill in Madison Heights that has prompted local, state, and federal officials to respond. Oakland County Executive David Coulter said all legal remedies should be used against a local business owner cited for causing an environmental mess. On Wednesday, Coulter testified before the House Appropriations Committee in Lansing focusing on how the county will work with local, state, and federal officials to comprehensively remediate the "green ooze" chemical spill originating from defunct Electro-Plating Services, located in Madison Heights along 10 Mile just south of I-696. Coulter was joined by Kathy Forzley, the county's director of health and human services. He spoke about putting the public's safety first, emphasizing that more tests need to be done, passing state polluter laws to hold those accountable who cause toxic spills, and how the county will work with Madison Heights to demolish the building in order to fully clean up the property. “Oakland County stands ready to work with the City of Madison Heights on options for the demolition that must occur before the site can be fully cleaned up,” he said. "Additional evaluation is helpful as a comprehensive remediation plan is developed."

Madison Heights officials are hoping to soon get an idea from the Environmental Protection Agency on how long it will take to cleanup up a contaminated site that caused a toxic green substance to ooze onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 two weeks ago. House Appropriations Committee Coulter Testimony on Contamination Last month, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) was made aware of toxic chemicals pouring out onto the shoulder of eastbound I-696. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently conducted soil and groundwater tests, with results pending, to understand how far the toxic chemicals have traveled and to prevent future leaks. Local and state officials have reassured residents living nearby that drinking water quality has not been impacted by the chemical spill, which will eventually end up in Lake St. Clair, according to the EPA. Tests on the chemicals showed levels of hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium 6, a cancer-causing chemical. Coulter said he would like to see deeper soil and aquifer testing conducted to ensure the contamination has not reached below the ground's clay layer. He also called for deeper monitoring wells so that the groundwater flow direction of the deeper aquifers could be determined. "Testing is needed for a significant distance along service lines such as sewers, electrical chases, natural gas runs, and any area such as these where the groundwater will follow because of disturbances in the natural soil," he said. EGLE also took water samples from nearby storm sewers and from Bear Creek, where the sewer water emerges and becomes surface water. Results, including for PFAS, should be available this week. In February 2019, Gary Sayers, the owner of Electro-Plating Services, was sentenced to one year in federal prison for storing hazardous waste at his business. He's now being sued by the City of Madison Heights to have him demolish the building. The city also is seeking the rights to demolish the building if Sayers does not comply with a court order to do so. Coulter said it's vital that Sayers is held accountable for this "chemical catastrophe." "It is outrageous that Mr. Sayers, the business owner, for decades operated an electroplating business in such an irresponsible nearly unbelievable manner including initiating the disposal of dangerous chemicals in a dirt pit," he said. "The fact that he is in prison is small comfort given the long and expensive road ahead to address his criminal behavior." Earlier this month, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for the State Legislature to draft and pass polluter laws that would force individuals and businesses causing hazardous spills to pay for the clean up. In addition, Whitmer said her administration is actively reviewing further criminal charges against Sayers.

 The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has collected about 11,000 gallons of contaminated water from the site of a condemned plating company near I-696 in Madison Heights. Groundwater and soil samples were taken Friday from the Electro-Plating Services property on 10 Mile Road. Two weeks ago a toxic green substance seeped from site onto the freeway, alarming people throughout the region and state. The EPA reported that two sump wells installed just before Christmas have collected almost 11,000 gallons of contaminated groundwater from beneath the facility and on the highway embankment where the contamination was discovered on Dec. 20. Most of the contaminated water collected has come from a pit Electro-Plating’s owner dug in the basement to illegally store hazardous materials. Madison Heights has been dealing with the issue through the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) and the EPA. Twenty-five wells for testing were drilled on and near the site. Test results will help analysts evaluate the contamination. That work will help investigators find the extent and levels of contamination and seek a more permanent solution to protect the environment and human health, according to a news release from EGLE. Test results are expected within a week or two. More testing and investigation are likely to be based on the results of the initial analyses. EGLE on Thursday sampled water at the point where the affected sewer system surfaces at Bear Creek to determine levels of contaminants entering the creek. That water eventually flows into the Clinton River and then Lake St. Clair. Officials said those results from those sample should be available late next week. Chemicals tested for include hexavalent chromium and other heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and cyanide. Though no nearby homes or business use well water and are on the Great Lakes Water Authority system, EGLE is to test drinking water as a precaution. EGLE Director Liesl Clark said the Electro-Plating site is one of thousands of contaminated sites that need to be more fully addressed and that a formal review of EGLE’s pollution inspection procedures is underway, as requested by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. “This situation highlights a long-term challenge that we must meet,” said Clark said in a statement. “Thousands of contaminated properties exist in Michigan, many having languished for decades without appropriate assessment or cleanup. That’s unacceptable in a state surrounded by almost 20 percent of the world’s fresh surface water.” She said contaminated sites have to be cleaned up sooner. “We will start 2020 by analyzing how best to accomplish this,” Clark said. “I look forward to working with EGLE, local communities, our federal partners, and our Michigan Legislature to put measures in place to aggressively attack these problems.” The heavy green toxic liquid in Madison Heights first showed up outside the condemned site on the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. Gary Sayers, owner of the company that caused the contamination, was sentenced in November to a year in prison and to pay $1.5 million to the EPA to cover the agency’s emergency cleanup of the site a couple of years ago. Sayers over decades failed to comply with orders to legally dispose of toxic waste at the plant, illegally storing it inside thousands of containers. Over time many of them corroded and leaked. Here is a look back at the news you may missed from the past week:

Macomb Daily file photo In this 2015 file photo, a pipe carrying PCB-tainted oil that is being sucked out of a manhole vault on Bon Brae Street is shown. Macomb Daily file photo WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has built up the biggest backlog of unfunded toxic Superfund clean-up projects in at least 15 years, nearly triple the number that were stalled for lack of money in the Obama era, according to 2019 figures quietly released by the Environmental Protection Agency over the winter holidays. The accumulation of Superfund projects that are ready to go except for money comes as the Trump administration routinely proposes funding cuts for Superfund and for the EPA in general. The four-decade-old Superfund program is meant to tackle some of the most heavily contaminated sites in the U.S. and Trump has declared it a priority even while seeking to shrink its budget. "There hasn't been a sense of urgency," said Violet Donoghue, who has lived for 31 years on Bon Brae Street in St. Clair Shores. Toxic PCBs have poisoned some local soil, water and fish at nearby Lake St. Clair, and the neighborhood is one of the 34 Superfund sites where clean-up projects languished for lack of money in 2019. "I feel many people have been harmed, but that's only my opinion," Donoghue said. She said the last word from the EPA was that soil would be removed from the front of her house. "Now when they say they're cleaning it, I say, 'OK, give me the date,'" she said. The unfunded projects are in 17 states and Puerto Rico. They range from abandoned mines that discharged heavy metals and arsenic in the West to an old wood pulp site in Mississippi and a defunct dry cleaner that released toxic solvents in North Carolina. Congress created the Superfund program in 1980 after the Love Canal episode and other notorious pollution cases. Its intent is to hold polluters responsible for cleanup costs or provide taxpayer money when no responsible party can be identified. Trump "is focused on putting Americans first," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told a Senate environment committee early 2019. "There may be no better example than our success in the Superfund program." "We are in the process of cleaning up some of the nation's largest, most complex sites and returning them to productive use," Wheeler said then. But two former EPA officials whose work dealt with Superfund oversight said the growing backlog of stalled Superfund projects under the Trump administration, and steady or ebbing numbers of clean-up construction projects completed, point to a different picture. "They're misleading Congress and the public about the funds that are needed to really protect the public from exposure to the toxic chemicals," said Elizabeth Southerland, who worked for 30 years at EPA, including as director of science and technology in the water office, before retiring in 2017. ''It's detrimental." This is a "regulatory failure," said Judith Enck, who served as the EPA's regional northeastern U.S. administrator under President Barack Obama. Given the growing numbers of unfunded clean-up projects, "EPA should be knocking on the door of Congress and saying, give us more money to deal with the sites,'' Enck said. Asked what the EPA spent money on instead, and why the agency didn't ask Congress for more to deal with the growing backlog, EPA spokeswoman Maggie Sauerhage offered few specifics Thursday. The EPA's Superfund program "will continue to prioritize new construction projects based on which sites present the greatest risk to human health and the environment," Sauerhage said in an email. "Further, the agency maintains the authority to respond to and fund emergencies at these sites if there is an imminent threat to human health and the environment." She pointed to some areas where Trump's Superfund effort was more on par with that of his predecessors. Long-term remedial efforts to make sure contamination didn't rebound at existing Superfund sites, for example, averaged 64 a year under Trump. That compares with an average of 60 a year in Obama's last five years. But overall, the backlog of 34 unfunded projects is up from only 12 in 2016, Obama's last year. At the site of another of 2019's unfunded Superfund projects, Montana's Upper Tenmile mining region, which includes the community of Rimini and a subdivision downstream, the EPA has been providing bottled water to residents for the past decade in response to water supplies polluted by about 150 abandoned gold, lead and copper mines. Pollution still flows from the mines and into Upper Tenmile Creek more than 20 years after the area was added to the Superfund list. About 6 miles from Rimini in the rural Landmark subdivision is a huge pile of contaminated soil that was removed from residential yards. It was supposed to be hauled away but now has weeds growing over it after sitting untouched for several years, said Patrick Keim, who lives nearby. "It's a sword of Damocles hanging over us," Keim said. "It just seems counterproductive they would spend two or three million dollars re-mediating this piece of property, haul it off and stockpile it across the road and then run out of money and leave this big pile for everybody to look at." Montana environmental regulators also are involved in the cleanup but say they need the EPA to come through with money for the work to resume, since the federal agency is providing 90 percent of funding. Under Trump, the EPA has pointed to a different yardstick in declaring it was making progress on Superfund clean-ups — the number of cleaned-up sites officially deleted from the roster of more than 1,300 Superfund sites. In 2019, for instance, the EPA said it had deleted all or part of 27 sites from the official Superfund list, saying that was the most deletions since the George W. Bush administration. But deletions from the list typically reflect clean-up work done over decades and often completed on the ground years ago, meaning Trump is sometimes taking credit for work done under his predecessors. In 2018, for example, the EPA cited the seven Superfund sites fully or partially removed from the list in the previous year as a signature accomplishment of the Trump administration. Records showed the physical work was completed before Trump took office, The Associated Press reported at the time. Sauerhage, the EPA spokeswoman, did not directly respond to questions about the backlog of 34 unfunded Superfund clean-up projects. The EPA posted the total on its website without fanfare the day after Christmas. Some of the projects that are ready to start have languished for lack of money since Trump's first year in office. EPA has been one of the main focuses of Trump's efforts to cut federal regulations and oversight that he sees as burdening businesses. Trump each year has asked Congress for nearly one-third cuts in EPA's budget, and has sought much smaller cuts for Superfund. Congress has kept both levels of funding roughly even. ___ White contributed from St. Clair Shores, Michigan, and Brown from Billings, Montana.

DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA work to clean up chemicals leaching onto the eastbound lanes in Madison Heights. DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY Storm drains in Warren connected to Interstate 696 are not contaminated with a hazardous chemical related to the green substance which oozed from the embankment on the eastbound side of the freeway in neighboring Madison Heights, officials said. Warren Mayor Jim Fouts said inspectors assigned to the industrial pre-treatment program at the Warren Waste Water Treatment Plant checked all storm drains that potentially could have been contaminated with the green goo, and found no pollution from the spill. "Great news," Fouts said. "I emphasize they checked all drains in Warren connected to 696 and found no contamination. We also closely monitor four businesses that use hexavalent." Tests on the so-called green ooze showed levels of hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium 6, a cancer-causing chemical. It is used in industry for the chrome plating on vehicles. On Monday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced her administration is looking into additional criminal charges against the operators of the abandoned Electro-Plating Services, the industrial company in Madison Heights linked to the green ooze and chemicals leaking from the site and onto the freeway, between Dequindre Road and John R. "The ongoing situation in Madison Heights is very concerning, and further stresses the need to enforce protections that keep Michiganders safe," said Whitmer, noting that she also wants to toughen pollution inspection and enforcement efforts. She said the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has been ordered to review how the agency inspects industrial discharges. "My administration is actively reviewing all means of accountability, including further criminal charges against the polluter who caused this mess. Today I also directed EGLE to conduct a formal review of its pollution inspection procedures to strengthen enforcement and accountability," the governor said in a prepared statement. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel echoed support of Whitmer's actions, saying her office would do "everything in our power" to assist the governor's office. She also announced the formation of a new criminal unit for environmental cases. "I have recently added new resources to our Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division and am creating a Criminal Unit that will focus specifically on environmental prosecutions," she said. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led crews have been working to prevent further leaks after a flow of a green liquid substance was observed spilling through an embankment wall onto the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. They are trying to determine how much of the chemical may have leached through into groundwater, which eventually would reach Lake St. Clair. Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said Tuesday the results of testing by Warren officials is indeed good news, providing a degree of relief. “I feel very good. I certainly applaud the efforts of Mayor Fouts and his team and being extremely pro-active and doing the testing they did,” Miller said. “I think the citizens of Warren can feel a high degree of confidence that in Macomb County we take these things seriously.” Miller isn’t breathing a complete sigh of relief, however. She said the threat to waterways and Lake St. Clair continues because of chemicals that leached onto the surface and into soil. Noting the green ooze, Miller said she is troubled that EGLE told the EPA as late as last spring that chemicals weren’t migrating. “When in fact it was,” Miller said. The Macomb County public works boss believes the embankment along I-696 in the area of the ooze potentially would have to be excavated. Miller said environmental engineers from her department will continue to be on site at Electro-Plating Services as work there continues. “We are going to partner with EGLE and EPA to understand what their plan is,” she added. On Sunday, Miller expressed concern that both EGLE and the EPA "did not adequately follow through" in initial cleanup measures. She feels the property requires long-term remediation and wants to see it demolished. State officials three years ago ordered Electro-Plating Services to close after discovering hundreds of corroded drums and vats of hazardous waste on the site. The property underwent a $1.5 million environmental partial cleanup in 2017 after it was named a Superfund site. The company's owner, Gary Sayers of Bloomfield Township, pleaded guilty in February in federal court to illegal storage of hazardous waste and sentenced to serve one year in prison. He is expected to surrender to authorities in the first quarter of 2020. Sayers also was ordered to pay $1.5 million restitution. Hugh McDiarmid Jr., a spokesman for EGLE, said Monday the department is working with federal and local officials to review decades of decision-making and testing at the site. It's not known how long the fact gathering will take. "It is important to note that significant cleanup and enforcement actions have taken place over the last three years, including property condemnation, a cease-and-desist order that stopped the polluting process, a criminal conviction, and a $1.5 million-$2 million federal emergency cleanup of thousands of drums of waste and contaminated liquid," McDiarmid said in an email. The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO According to the EPA, the agency has dispatched personnel to respond to the site to remove contamination that is migrating off the property. Those actions include: • Removing contaminated water that had leaked onto I-696 and into the catch basins of the sewer system. • Installing two sumps. The first, in the basement pit of the Electro-Plating Services building, to collect and remove water from the basement into a portable tank to prevent water from migrating off-site. The second, a collection system along the embankment wall of I-696 which has been plumbed to discharge into a frac-tank that has been placed on the shoulder of the highway. Both sumps are operational 24 hours a day. • Collecting more than 7,000 gallons of liquid from storm drains, the on-site monitoring well and the basement of the former plating facility. • Beginning an expanded assessment to determine what further actions may be necessary, including drilling test wells to evaluate how far contamination has migrated through area soil. Madison Heights officials are seeking a court order to have Sayers demolish the abandoned building. A trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 13 in Oakland County Circuit Court. Fouts noted that many industries are starting to switch to a fake paint which gives the same appearance as the use of hexavalent chromium. “The state of Michigan should mandate that hexavalent be discontinued and the use of fake paint be used as a replacement,” the mayor said. “I'm also very impressed with the effort and expertise that Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller has demonstrated in her effort to protect Macomb County from this highly toxic ooze in Oakland County.” Fouts also commended Warren Waste Treatment Director Bryan Clor for his effort to get the inspections of the storm drains started. This report was updated at 12:40 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 31.

MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO Erin Brockovich PHOTO FROM FACEBOOK The old Electro-Plating Services' sign. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PHOTO Preliminary test results of soil and groundwater at and near the site of the “green ooze” on Interstate 696 show no risk to drinking water but high levels of multiple contaminants. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in a news release late Friday afternoon that complete data from the testing will be available after a quality control review is complete next week. Test of water in the storm sewers near the site showed levels of hexavalent chromium at 0.14 milligrams per liter. The standard for drinking water is 0.10 mg/L. Officials had previously indicated that chemical was found. The EGLE said drinking water intakes in Lake St. Clair have not been impacted. “The storm sewer eventually enters Lake St. Clair miles away,” EGLE said. “At that point, concentrations would be well below detectable levels although still a significant concern for incremental accumulation in the ecosystem.” The green liquid substance was found last Friday spilling onto the eastbound side of the freeway between John R and Dequindre roads in Madison Heights through an embankment wall. Officials learned it came from a nearby business, Electro-Plating Services on 10 Mile Road, that was shut down by the state three years ago "after inspectors discovered hundreds of corroded drums, vats and other containers of hazardous waste at the site," according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It was partially cleaned up by the EPA. Clean-up efforts at the site, near the Warren border, have begun. The EPA-conducted tests also showed high levels of contaminants in the groundwater between the building and the I-696 service drive, including chromium, trichloroethylene and cyanide – all chemicals previously used in the EPS facility, EGLE said. "Since 1967, the company used copper, tin, bronze, cadmium, nickel, chrome, gold, silver, zinc and lead for various electroplating operations, resulting in the contamination," the EPA said in 2017. Soil tests on the embankment where the green liquid appeared on the shoulder also showed hexavalent chromium, as well as multiple heavy metals and other contaminants at levels below the threshold for direct human contact, EGLE said Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller earlier Friday called the leak “life-threatening and terrifying.” Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller speaks at her office. MACOMB DAILY FILE PHOTO “The toxic waste coming from this business site in Madison Heights is life-threatening and terrifying,” Miller said in a prepared statement. “The current conditions in that business – conditions after a $1.5 million EPA-led cleanup – tells me that guidelines on how such cleanups are conducted are inadequate. The bare minimum was done on this clean up. This situation requires both immediate and long-term remediation. The building should be demolished and the surrounding soils tested and excavated. A strong advocate for clean water, Miller said the discovery “may have been a blessing in disguise as it led to the revelation of an incredibly dangerous situation at this abandoned business.” “This incident has shown that deadly chemicals from this site can leach out and have the potential of making their way all the way to Lake St. Clair and thereby entering our drinking water supply.” The incident has gained national attention. Hexavalent chromium is the same chemical found in groundwater in California that led Erin Brokovich to help a campaign building a case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in 1993 that inspired the 2000 movie, “Erin Brockovich." Brockovich posted about it Monday on her Facebook page. “Nothing like being thought of around the holiday season for 'Green Ooze,' Brockovich wrote. “We will be following up to insure the chromium doesn't contaminate any surface water bodies ... and that the ground water and soils are indeed thoroughly cleaned up.” The chemical is a carcinogen, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It is used in the industrial process to increase hardening-ability and corrosion resistance of steel. EPS and its owner, Gary Sayers, were charged with illegal operation of a hazardous waste facility by U.S. Attorneys. Sayers was sentenced in November in U.S. District Court in Detroit to one year and one day in prison. He is to begin serving early next year. The location was declared a Superfund site by the EPA. Since the spill, the grassy slope and shoulder have been fenced off, and the Couzens Road exit lane and a right lane have been closed and will remain closed indefinitely, said Diane Cross of the Michigan Department of Transportation. “There is no timetable (for the closures),” she said. “It will definitely go into January.” A pit in the basement of Electro-Plating Services in Madison Heights in December 2017. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PHOTO EGLE said the EPA conducted a cleanup of the site in 2017. It removed hazardous chemicals and pumping contaminated liquid from an earthen pit in the basement of the facility. “This clean-up addressed the immediate hazards on the site but was not intended to address all environmental impacts,” EGLE said. EGLE said that late next week the EPA will begin dozens of soil borings to help determine the extent and levels of contamination. Regulators continue to work on the site daily, including the following activities, according to EGLE: * Daily vacuuming of nearby catch basins. * Maintenance and inspection of sump pumps collecting contaminated water from both inside the facility and on the highway embankment. * Daily monitoring of air in the building using hand-held monitors. * Preparing for the impact of rain and freezing weather. EGLE said that gravel that partially filled a “basement pit at EPS following the EPA clean-up ... was saturated with green water and there was 2-3 inches of frozen water on top of the gravel. “A sump was dug into the gravel and a float-operated pump was installed. The water is being pumped into a 20,000-gallon portable tank on site,” EGLE said. “EPA contractors will continue to remove water from the basement at EPS while a long-term remedy is developed.” To report environmental emergencies, contact the Pollution Emergency Alerting System hotline 1-800-292-4706. EGLE will post updates at Electroplating Services / I-696 Incident.

STATE OF MICHIGAN PHOTO The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. FILE PHOTO A green liquid that leaked on to Interstate 696 in Madison Heights came from a company whose owner was recently sentenced to one year in prison for illegally operating a hazardous material facility. The liquid was found Friday afternoon oozing on to the eastbound side of the freeway near Couzens Road near the Warren border. It was determined the substance, which contained Hexavalent chromium, originated from Electro-Plating Services, 945 E. 10 Mile Road, which was shut down three years ago by what was known then as the state Department of Environmental Quality. It was later declared a Superfund site by the federal Environmental Protection Agency for illegal storage of hazardous material. The company and its owner, Gary Alfred Sayers, were charged with a crime and sentenced Nov. 5 to one year in prison in U.S. District Court in Detroit. Sayers and the company were ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution for the cost of the clean-up, which was completed in January 2018. Materials included cyanide, chromium, chloride and various acids as part of its plating process, and were stored in drums, containers and a pit dug in the ground. In the recent incident, the Michigan Department of Transportation reported a green liquid substance leaking from a retaining wall along the embankment. A liquid substance leaks on to Interstate 696 on Friday in Madison Heights. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO A HAZMAT team and local, state and federal officials responded and stopped the leak and have been conducting a clean-up and containment. Hexavalent chromium is a carcinogen that is harmful if inhaled or exposed to unprotected skin. The Couzens exit lane and ramp and the right thru-lane were closed and will remain closed until at least Friday while officials await the results of test samples to determine if other substances were also present. Jill Greenberg, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, said Monday that HAZMAT workers vacuumed storm sewers and catch basins in the area and placed a sump-pump in the business’ basement to prevent groundwater from spreading. A fence was erected on the embankment to prevent anyone from entering the contaminated area, she added. Greenberg said there has been no evidence that anyone has come into contact with the substance or that any drinking water was impacted. “There’s no imminent danger to drinking water,” she said. Some of the substance may have migrated from the area into a nearby drain and eventually into Lake St. Clair but that has not been determined. She said officials will decide the next phase of operation after the test results are learned Friday. A clean-up could involve removing the embankment in the area. State Rep. Lori Stone, D-Warren, vowed Monday to "remain vigilant" in monitoring and correcting the situation.

STATE OF MICHIGAN PHOTO “I am alarmed by the threat (Hexavalent chromium) poses for soil, groundwater and watershed contamination, putting the health and safety of our families at risk," she said. State Sen. Jeremy Moss, D-Southfield, and state Rep. Jim Ellison, D-Royal Oak, added in a joint statement: “Preventable situations such as this are why we must act with urgency to enforce stronger policies to hold polluters accountable and protect our residents." Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice S. Miller commended the quick response but said the incident points out the need for a coordinated monitoring plan to protect Great Lakes water quality. “Michigan EGLE and EPA were quickly on the job and engaged in this clean up on what was essentially a holiday weekend,” Miller said in a written statement. “This issue points out the need to monitor and have a means to capture the storm water off our major freeways – which amounts to millions of gallons of water per year directly entering into Lake St. Clair and the Great Lake system.” Whether Electro-Plating Services and the owner will face other sanctions has not been determined. Miller said her agency is “concerned” that the groundwater around the business was not tested, in light of the $1.5 million clean-up. “We cannot continue to operate the way that we have in the past," she said. "The Great Lakes are a world treasure, and we must work together to serve as their guardians. A single drop of this chromium 6 contamination that might enter the lake is one drop too much." Miller noted that this year Macomb County Public Works has responded to several instances of oil sheens, cement run-off and old paint entering into the county drains. MCPWO operates a 24-hour spill response emergency number, (877) 679-4337. Those who see an emergency situation may also call 911.
