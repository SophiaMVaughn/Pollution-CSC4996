 The Midland Daily News This column will be a little different than the usual approach that I take. I read an interesting commentary about an interview taken from Medcape Family Medicine, July 14, 2016, with Robert D. Brook, MD, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Michigan and Director of the Hypertension Center there. Dr. Brook is from Michigan and does research on the effects of air pollution. He said he was sitting on the beach in the late 1990s with his brother who is an atmospheric scientist. Dr. Brook thought the haze he saw on the horizon, while looking over Lake Michigan, was “sea haze.” His brother explained to him, however, that it was pollution causing the foggy atmosphere. It piqued Dr. Brook’s interest and so began his lifelong research into the effects of pollution on healthcare. As with most of us, Dr. Brook thought the major problem with air pollution was that it caused lung problems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other issues like these. Research has shown, however, that the majority of health effects from air pollution are adverse cardiovascular events. This includes heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and sudden death. Air pollution is the ninth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Air pollution in defined in terms of fine PM. A PM 2.5 means particles that are less than 2.5 µm in diameter. They result from fossil fuel combustion (coal, gas, etc.), mobile sources such as traffic, or the energy industry in the modern world. The PM for a particular size is then measured in weight/m3. In the United States, the average PM 2.5 is about 10 µg/m3. In comparison, PM levels in a smoky bar are about 500 µg/m3. A little bit confusing but just compare the numbers while reading below. For the last few years, the United States has gone down from levels of 25 to 30 µg/m3 in the 1970s and 1980s to an average level of 10 µg/m3 now. This dramatic reduction has translated into an improvement in all-cause mortality leading to a six- to seven-month increase in life expectancy on average in the United States. (I thought that was pretty impressive!) However, close to 25 percent of Americans are still exposed to levels above the World Health Organization standards of 10µg/m3. Many such areas are next to roadways or in urban industrial locations. People in Asia, particularly China and India, are exposed to far higher levels of pollution than we now are. These are also the areas where cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are escalating dramatically. It is interesting to note that second-hand smoke levels are around 500 µg/m3. One cigarette delivers well over 5000 to 10,000 µg/m3. One cigarette is comparable to a month’s worth of exposure to air pollution in Beijing, China! So how does air pollution trigger the cardiovascular/heart problems? Extensive research has shown different ways. Pollutants injure the lining of the blood vessels, they cause the blood vessels to constrict and narrow, and the platelets in the blood which are involved in clotting become more sensitized and clot more easily. This all leads to more clots in the vessels (strokes and heart attacks) and arrhythmias in the heart (sudden death). (I’m simplifying this significantly!) Then the next question is: How do the pollutants do these things? For those of you who have read this column regularly, you have learned that it appears that inflammation is the first step in the cascade of events that cause strokes, heart attacks, cancer and dementia. Reduce inflammation and you reduce all of these major killers. It turns out that when the lung inhales pollution particles, the lung tissue becomes inflamed. The inflammation isn’t just isolated to the lungs, but rather inflammatory chemicals throughout the body are increased. Subsequently, the inflammation causes vascular and cardiovascular tissue to be inflamed, causing constricting of the vessels, as well as the clotting and buildup of atheroscleratic plaques. Interesting! Inflammation is the culprit once again. Many of us have heard about inflammation around the gums (gingivitis) causing heart disease. It’s part of the same story. Gingivitis causes significant inflammation which generalizes throughout the body. It is the chemicals that cause inflammation that lead to the major problems of strokes, heart attacks, cancer, and dementia. A second way that air pollution leads to heart problems is that the lung can sense these foreign particles and promote rapid changes in the body’s chemistry. It’s sort of the “flight or fight” response. Our body surges with various hormonal chemicals when it feels “attacked” and that leads to an increase in blood pressure, constriction of blood vessels, and heart arrhythmias. The final way that the pollution affects the heart and blood vessels is that the very chemicals causing the pollution are toxic in themselves. Those chemicals are absorbed through the lungs and have a direct effect on various body tissues. There are thousands of very fine particles of organic chemicals and metals in pollution. Cigarette smoke is a convenient way to deliver nicotine into the body, but the air we breathe delivers many of those other chemicals also. If scientists can detect these bodily responses to short term exposures to pollutants, imagine what happens over the long term. Think of the adverse effects on the body’s systems. We must remember that pollution is not the only factor causing heart and lung problems. Diet, obesity and exercise all play a role. But when you add on pollution, the effects multiply. One final thing in the interview was discussion of the mask that you see many Asians wearing when they are in the major cities. Do they filter out pollution? Mostly the masks being worn are simple surgical masks that protect people from respiratory droplets. They aren’t made to protect us from the fine particles in air. China and the rest of Asia are often exposed to PM levels between 100 to 500 µg/m3 (10 to 50 times what the average level is in the United States). There is some evidence showing that home air filters or purifications systems with HEPA filters do reduce exposures and lead to improved health. Research is ongoing. So, as I noted, this is a little different approach to my usual column, but rather interesting stuff, isn’t it? Dr. John L. Pfenninger’s column appears on Sundays. His office, Medical Procedures Center, is located in Midland.

 By EMERY P. DALESIO RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina judge said Friday he wants to review a surprise deal settling decades of groundwater pollution at Duke Energy's coal ash pits because he questioned the motives behind the company's deal with state environmental regulators. The deal reduced the $25 million fine at a Wilmington power plant that state regulators had promoted as the largest penalty for environmental damage in state history. The agreement cut the fine to $7 million but also sought to resolve groundwater pollution claims at all 14 of the company's power plants storing toxic coal ash, not just one. The judge who signed off on the settlement last fall went too far with his order that seemed to close lawsuits involving conservation groups, Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway said. "It is a bit surprising that in a penalty case over one plant, it developed into as comprehensive a settlement as this," Ridgeway said. The Department of Environmental Quality could decide the appropriate fine for Duke Energy polluting the groundwater at its Sutton power plant, Ridgeway said. But because Administrative Law Judge Phil Berger Jr. wasn't asked to rewrite the scope of his order approving the deal, Ridgeway said he suspected the settlement's language was designed to close the courtroom door to environmental groups or others. "I have to suspect that there is some ulterior motive," he said. The parties later agreed to ask Berger to revise his order, Duke Energy spokeswoman Erin Culbert said. Berger is the son of state Senate leader Phil Berger. The Republican's district includes Eden, site of a 2014 spill of toxic coal ash that prompted a new law requiring Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash holding pits by 2029. State water quality officials knew for years about the contamination at Sutton's unlined ash pits but took no enforcement action until August 2013 — after a citizens groups tried to sue Duke Energy. Monitoring wells near Duke's dumps at Sutton showed readings exceeding state groundwater standards for chemicals including boron and thallium, which was used in rat poison until it was banned because it is highly toxic. The hearing came on the day DEQ signed off for the first time on plans to drain the water off the top of basins where coal ash is collected, a needed step to closing, excavating or covering them. The state permit for work at Duke Energy's Riverbend power plant in Mount Holly is intended to be a model for documents needed to close coal ash pits around the state. It allows water to be diverted to rivers and streams until 3 feet of water remains above the ash. Duke Energy will be required to test fish near the discharge site to see whether their bodies contain collected mercury or lead, and twice a year test the waterway for those heavy metals and arsenic, chromium and cadmium. ___ Follow Emery P.

 The Associated Press FREEPORT, Texas (AP) — Before Houston and its suburbs were built, a dense forest naturally purified the air along a stretch of the Texas Gulf Coast that grew thick with pecan, ash, live oak and hackberry trees. It was the kind of pristine woodland that was mostly wiped out by settlers in their rush to clear land and build communities. Now one of the nation’s largest chemical companies and one of its oldest conservation groups have forged an unlikely partnership that seeks to recreate some of that forest to curb pollution. The plan drafted by The Dow Chemical Co. and the Nature Conservancy is only in its infancy and faces many hurdles. But it envisions a day when expensive machines used to capture industrial pollutants might be at least partially replaced by restoring some of the groves of native trees that once filled the land. “It looks very promising at the early stage of the research,” said Mark Weick, director of sustainability programs for Dow. “But for this to become something that is an emission control, everyone needs to know it works.” Many plants, and especially trees, capture pollution naturally when it hits their leaves. Trees with the biggest leaves and the widest canopies capture the most pollutants, especially nitrogen oxide, a common byproduct of combustion that can irritate lungs and contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone. The reforestation proposal imagines emissions from Dow’s largest North American factory drifting downwind into the trees near Freeport, Texas. Dow and the Nature Conservancy began a six-year, $10 million collaboration in 2011, when they came together to look at ways natural resources could be used to save the company money. After reading an obscure notation by the federal Environmental Protection Agency that suggested reforestation could improve air quality, the two groups decided to research how the idea might work and whether it could be cost-effective. Scientists used a complex model from the U.S. Forest Service that considers everything from wind patterns to the size of tree leaves and the overall canopy to estimate the air-quality improvements that might come from 1,000 acres of forest. “The big discovery was that you could combine the traditional infrastructure with reforestation and still meet regulation,” said Laura Huffman, the conservancy’s director in Texas. The trees, Huffman said, may not completely replace traditional technology, but they could complement it, allowing factories to use smaller, cheaper equipment. The research found that over 30 years a 1,000-acre forest would remove 4 to 7 tons of nitrogen oxide annually, said Timm Kroeger, a senior environmental economist with the conservancy. A traditional mechanical “scrubber” removes about 50 to 70 tons annually. So a 10,000-acre forest equals one average industrial scrubber, he explained. And in this part of Texas, where open land is ample, reforestation is within reach. The cost of the project not including the land would be about the same as using traditional forms of pollution control, Weick said. Organizers hope to work with a landowner interested in reforesting, probably with help from conservation tax credits. Or the Nature Conservancy or the federal government would buy the land and give it to Dow free of charge. A recent progress report determined that the cost of cleaning a ton of nitrogen oxide through reforestation was $2,400 to $4,000, compared with $2,500 to $5,000 using traditional equipment. The research is still being reviewed by other scientists. And before any formal plan could be adopted, it would have to win approval from state and federal regulators, who would require any pollution-cleansing method to be quantifiable and enforceable. Trees may not fit the bill. Unlike machines, they are living organisms that are subject to diseases, droughts and other threats such as hurricanes or fires. Back in 2005, another scientific group researched a similar idea and decided it would not pay off. “The conclusion that we reached was that what they were trying to do was difficult and that the degree of uncertainty was larger than the benefits,” said Mark Estes, a senior air quality scientist with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Even if it wins broad support, the plan won’t be approved anytime soon. In Texas, it can take up to four years to change clean-air rules. And that’s before any proposal moves up to the EPA. As he looked out over land ripe for reforestation, Jeff Wiegel, the conservancy’s director of strategic initiatives in Texas, was realistic about the pace of progress. “It’s a long road toward that,” he said.
