The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy determined the An oily spill discovered in Pine River on Tuesday has been determined not to contain PCBs, which are a man-made chemical known to cause adverse health effects for humans. Nick Assendelft, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), said the spill was dielectric fluid, which is used as a coolant, that leaked from a transformer. A St. Louis area resident had obtained the transformer in the hopes of scrapping the metal and while transferring the liquid inside to three 55-gallon drums, some of it leaked out and made its way to the river. Other news outlets, such as the Morning Sun newspaper, have reported the property was located on East Jackson Road and the spill made its way to the river via Bush Creek. Wednesday afternoon, the spill had been determined not to contain PCBs, which is a good thing, Assendelft said, though the spill is still a concern for EGLE. PCB, polychlorinated biphenyls, are a group of man-made chemicals with no smell or taste used in industrial processes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, PCB is known to cause a variety of adverse health effects and are known to cause cancer in animals. “The fact that there are no PCBs makes it a lot better situation at this point,” Assendelft said. He said the spill has been contained and there is no further leakage at this time. Crews continue to work on cleaning up the spill. Tuesday afternoon, the City of Midland was made aware of a liquid sheen on the water surface that was four to five miles long. Midland County 911 issued a warning to residents that is still in effect, to avoid Pine River near Woodcock and Prairie roads, extending the warning to the Tittabawasse and Chippewa Rivers as well. EGLE has been working with local officials in Midland and Gratiot counties to investigate and capture the liquid using vacuum equipment. A couple hundred gallons of water has been captured, which partially contains the liquid. However, crews are currently trying to determine details, such as how much of the fluid was in the transformer to begin with, to understand how much is still left to capture and clean up. “Some of this might have been captured on site just because it spilled onto the ground so that’s another thing we need to determine, is how much conceivably spilled onto the ground and is contained in the soil, and if we need to do soil remediation,” Assendelft said Wednesday. “And then how much of this spilled into the river? So, that is something that we’re trying to determine today – the capacity of the transformer, how much was captured and then essentially what is left and what happens to that.” Assendelft said it’s not unusual for transformers to be purchased for scraping, however, there are strict rules and regulations that must be followed to dispose of the liquid inside them. “There are some strict things you need to do in terms of containing the liquid inside and making sure that doesn’t leak and also making sure that that liquid does not contain PCBs,” he said. “So, if you essentially get one of these transformers through maybe a demolition job, and you are able to get the liquids out and there is no PCB, then you certainly can take that transformer then to the scrap yard and with documentation, and scrap it.” In addition, officials will work to determine how the spill happened, and the intent associated with it to figure out the next steps and whether there will be implications for the person responsible. Assendelft said in the meantime, residents should stay out of the water until the spill is taken care of and to allow crews working on the spill to do their job.

Earlier Tuesday afternoon, the City of Midland was notified of a possible petroleum sheen about four to five miles long located upstream of Midland on the Pine River. After an onsite investigation, officials with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes & Energy (EGLE) have determined that the sheen is caused by motor oil leaking from heavy equipment at a residence in Saint Louis, Michigan. The sheen will be visible in the Pine and Tittabawassee rivers as it passes through Midland. Residents may contact the EGLE Pollution Emergency Alerting System (PEAS) Hotline at 800-292-4706 with questions or additional information regarding this incident.

 Ashley Schafer, Ashley.Schafer@hearstnp.com Crews continue testing and clean-up efforts in and along Bush Creek, after a spill was identified in the Pine River Tuesday night in Midland County. Currently, there is no concern of contamination to municipal or private drinking water supplies, according to Gratiot County Emergency Management. “(Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy) partners want to emphasize the source of the release has been located, no further release is occurring, mitigation/remediation efforts are in place, and it has been determined there are no PCBs involved,” the county’s report states. The source of the liquid was discovered to be from a transformer, which a St. Louis area resident had purchased with the intent of scrapping for metal. He had emptied the dielectric fluid from inside the transformer into three 55-gallon drums, however, in the process, the fluid had leaked and made its way to the river via Bush Creek. Nick Assendelft, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environmental, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) said they were concerned the liquid contained PCBs, which are man-made chemicals known to cause adverse health effects in humans and animals. However, Initial lab results showed the liquid did not contain PCBs and additional lab tests came back Thursday confirming the initial tests. Further testing of samples is taking place to determine if the dielectric fluid, which is similar to mineral oil, contains any other chemicals. According to the report from Gratiot County Emergency Management Detective Dan Kennedy, (DNR) Environmental Investigation Section conducted a site investigation and interviews at the scene of the incident. It states the property owner/responsible party is fully cooperating with all authorities. In addition, booms, which are floating devices meant to contain spills, have been placed along Buch Creek and will remain in place until there is no more sheen on the water. The booms are on Bush Creek in Bethany Township and at North Baldwin Road, M-46 and North Blair Road. As of Thursday, Bierlien Companies, which offers environmental remediation services, is on site doing soil remediation and cleaning the area. Other entities who have been involved in the efforts include EGLE, DNR, Gratiot County Emergency Management, St Louis Area Fire Department, AKT Peerless, Consumers Energy, Gratiot County Central Dispatch/911, Midland County Emergency Management, and Midland County Central Dispatch/911. Assendelft said local emergency managers will make the call as to when they feel it’s safe for people to come into contact with the water once again.

 LAS VEGAS (AP) — State officials who monitor chemical contaminations at 40 sites in southern Nevada are now preparing for a large-scale cleanup at one that stemmed from a spill at a dry-cleaning shop decades ago. The Las Vegas Sun reports (http://bit.ly/29F2AWA ) that more than 200 homes sit atop a plume created years ago at a dry-cleaning operation. The cancer-causing chemical bled into groundwater after a 1982 spill, and officials say the plume now stretches more than a mile long. State regulators hope to begin extracting the perchloroethylene, or PCE, by spring of 2017. Recently they have installed mitigating systems to keep the chemical out of homes. Regulators are in the process of finalizing that plan with the former owners of the Maryland Square property, who were found responsible to pay for the cleanup. ___ Information from: Las Vegas Sun, http://www.lasvegassun.com

Firefighters put down absorbent pads by a small lake of diesel fuel Monday morning in an effort to contain a leak from a tanker truck that overturned on the Homer Adams Parkway extension north of East Broadway. ALTON — An overturned tanker truck on Monday morning ruptured and spilled diesel fuel into Wood River Creek in Alton. Alton Fire Chief Jesse Jemison said that, at about 5:50 a.m. Monday, the Alton Fire Department received a call about a semi-tanker carrying diesel fuel which had run off the Homer Adams Parkway Extension northbound. The truck overturned into a ditch near Wood River Creek, near the Circle K gas station in the Alton jurisdiction, about a quater mile north of East Broadway. The tanker appeared to have overturned while negotiating a curve, rolling down an embankment and landing on the edge of Wood River Creek. The tanker also struck a number of large rocks, which ruptured the tanker in multiple places. Materials also appeared to be leaking from a top hatch of the tanker. Containment measures were undertaken by the Alton Fire Department, and officials from the Madison County Hazardous Materials Team responded to the site, as did a team from ConocoPhillips’ Wood River Refinery which sent several firefighters and a foam truck. Members of Heritage Environmental Services (HES) also were at the site to aid with the clean-up. “As of right now, they’ve collected about 3,000 gallons of fuel,” Jemison said shortly before 10 a.m. Monday. A large pool of diesel fuel was seen near the truck. Jemison said some of the material from the tanker leaked into the creek. Firefighters used absorbent pads and booms in an effort to contain the spilled fuel, which formed a sheen on the creek. A vacuum truck, often used for large volume spills, also was called to the site to extract the pooled fuel. Four-wheelers and four-wheel-drive trucks were brought in to track the spill as it headed downstream. Alton and East Alton firefighters gathered on both banks at the mouth of the creek where it feeds into the Mississippi River, with firefighters using a rope gun to launch a line across the creek. Alton East firefighters and HES members then pulled a boom across the creek to contain the spilled diesel fuel and prevent it from traveling downstream. Another tanker truck was brought to the scene to offload the remaining diesel fuel in the damaged semi-tanker. The driver of the truck, who has not been identified, appeared not to be injured Monday. The roadway was closed well into Monday afternoon because of the accident and ensuing cleanup. Jemison said the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency had not yet been contacted, but will “more than likely” be involved. No other information was immediately Monday on the accident.

 RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Dominion Virginia Power could face financial penalties and reimbursement costs for a mineral oil spill that fouled a portion of the Potomac River, state environmental officials said Friday. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued a notice of violation for the spill, a first step to ensure that the power company is held accountable for the spill. A transformer failure at a substation in Crystal City led to the release of 13,500 gallons of mineral oil. The DEQ reports of a sheen on the river on Feb. 3. A portion of the spill eventually ended up along the banks of the Potomac River and in the river itself. DEQ said 29 fish and waterfowl were found dead after the spill. In a statement, Dominion said it had accepted responsibility for the spill, adding that "more than 95" percent of the oil had been recovered. The DEQ said the state can assess civil penalties at the rate $100 per gallon and require corrective reaction involving any environmental damage.

 GILLETTE, Wyo. (AP) — Officials say a pipeline leak that caused between 1,200 and 1,700 gallons of crude oil to spill into a creek near Gillette has been clamped to prevent further leakage. The Gillette News Record reports (http://bit.ly/20FxCzB ) that the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality has blamed the leak that was reported Sunday on internal corrosion of the pipeline. A spokesman for Belle Fourche Pipeline, Bill Salvin, says the company is still investigating the leak to determine an official cause. The oil had covered about a quarter mile of Timber Creek in northern Campbell County and leaked under a railroad and through a culvert. Belle Fourche employees worked to burn most of the oil out of the water Monday. Salvin says the cleanup will last a couple more days. ___ Information from: The Gillette (Wyo.)

The Army Corps of Engineers said in a release that the lock and dam were closed Wednesday after the spill and reopened later Wednesday evening. The spill occurred at Lock and Dam 25, which is located about 45 miles north of St. Louis.

 CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Federal government scientists have released a final update of their study of the January 2014 chemical spill that temporarily fouled the drinking water supplies of 300,000 Charleston-area residents, reporting no significant new findings. The Charleston Gazette-Mail ( http://bit.ly/29uLXOS ) cited the report Friday as finding "most of the spilled chemicals had no effects in the studies that were performed" after the spill of coal-cleaning agent Crude MCHM at a Freedom Industries site near the Elk River that year. The work was conducted by the National Toxicology Program at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The newspaper said scientists found any potential for negative health effects would only occur at significantly higher doses than residents would have had in their water under a health advisory set up after the spill. One concern not addressed in the report is how dangerous inhalation of the chemical might be. Residents may have been exposed to airborne MCHM when they followed state-promoted guidelines for running hot and cold water to flush the chemical out of their pipes. Federal officials originally planned to study that and come up with a limit for how much MCHM is safe in the air, but they quickly abandoned the idea and no air sampling was done. John Bucher, associate director of the NTP, said in a phone interview, "We really had no clue about what kinds of levels of exposures were happening during the flushing." Bucher also said it's not clear why the federal study found skin irritation from the chemical only at very high exposure levels, while residents reported such effects as a common symptom when they sought medical help following the spill. NTP report also mentions a birth weight study performed by the state Department of Health and Human Resources. That report was posted on a state website but hasn't been widely publicized. It found no increase in the percentage of pre-term and low birth-weight babies born in the region affected by the spill.

 SUTHERLAND, Iowa (AP) — Authorities say thousands of fish have been killed in Berry Creek in northwest Iowa following a manure spill. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources says about 2,500 fish were killed along nearly two miles of the creek northeast of Sutherland. That discovery came after an estimated 5,000 gallons of liquid manure was spilled Thursday afternoon at a hog operation. Officials say the owner quickly stopped the spill between two manure tanks and dammed an area above the creek to contain the spill. Officials say the fish killed were smaller species, including minnows, shiners, stonerollers and chubs. Live fish were also found in the stream.

 By DAN ELLIOTT Caption Close DENVER (AP) — Construction crews will return this weekend to the scene of a massive mine-waste spill in southwestern Colorado to stabilize the mine opening with steel and concrete, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday. The EPA said the work is designed to keep rock and dirt from collapsing at the entrance to the Gold King Mine and to make sure it's safe to enter during future cleanup efforts. The stabilization work will last through October. An EPA-led contractor inadvertently triggered a spill of 3 million gallons of wastewater from the Gold King on Aug. 5 while doing preliminary cleanup work. The blowout tainted rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah with potentially toxic heavy metals, prompting utilities and farmers to stop drawing from the waterways. The water quality quickly returned to pre-spill levels, the EPA says. In an email to The Associated Press, the EPA said it is very unlikely the work being done at the mine this year would trigger another spill. "The EPA has taken precautions to prevent any unanticipated discharges," the agency said. The contractor hired to do this summer's work, Environmental Restoration LLC, was also on the scene at the time of the August blowout. But the EPA and outside investigators have said it was government officials, not the contractor, who made the decision to begin the work that led to the spill. The EPA pledged to alert downstream communities if anything goes wrong this summer, using a notification plan put in place after the August blowout. The agency was widely criticized for not alerting all the tribal, state and local governments affected by the spill. Wastewater is still running from the mine, and if the rate increases during this summer's work, a temporary treatment plant installed last fall can handle a higher flow, the EPA said. The $1.8 million plant went into operation in October. Officials said at the time it could handle 800 gallons per minute, while wastewater was flowing from the mine at about 560 gallons per minute. The plant is scheduled to run through November of this year. Colorado lawmakers have urged the EPA to keep it operating, and the agency said Friday it is looking into that. The August blowout triggered lawsuits and intense criticism of the EPA, both for causing the spill and for its handling of the aftermath. The agency has proposed using the federal Superfund program to fund a long-term cleanup of the Gold King and other nearby mining sites. ___ Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP.
