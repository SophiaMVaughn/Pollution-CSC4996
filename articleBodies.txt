Nick Assendelft, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), said the spill was dielectric fluid, which is used as a coolant, that leaked from a transformer. A St. Louis area resident had obtained the transformer in the hopes of scrapping the metal and while transferring the liquid inside to three 55-gallon drums, some of it leaked out and made its way to the river. Other news outlets, such as the Morning Sun newspaper, have reported the property was located on East Jackson Road and the spill made its way to the river via Bush Creek. Wednesday afternoon, the spill had been determined not to contain PCBs, which is a good thing, Assendelft said, though the spill is still a concern for EGLE. PCB, polychlorinated biphenyls, are a group of man-made chemicals with no smell or taste used in industrial processes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, PCB is known to cause a variety of adverse health effects and are known to cause cancer in animals. “The fact that there are no PCBs makes it a lot better situation at this point,” Assendelft said. He said the spill has been contained and there is no further leakage at this time. Crews continue to work on cleaning up the spill. Tuesday afternoon, the City of Midland was made aware of a liquid sheen on the water surface that was four to five miles long. Midland County 911 issued a warning to residents that is still in effect, to avoid Pine River near Woodcock and Prairie roads, extending the warning to the Tittabawasse and Chippewa Rivers as well. EGLE has been working with local officials in Midland and Gratiot counties to investigate and capture the liquid using vacuum equipment. A couple hundred gallons of water has been captured, which partially contains the liquid. However, crews are currently trying to determine details, such as how much of the fluid was in the transformer to begin with, to understand how much is still left to capture and clean up. “Some of this might have been captured on site just because it spilled onto the ground so that’s another thing we need to determine, is how much conceivably spilled onto the ground and is contained in the soil, and if we need to do soil remediation,” Assendelft said Wednesday. “And then how much of this spilled into the river? So, that is something that we’re trying to determine today – the capacity of the transformer, how much was captured and then essentially what is left and what happens to that.” Assendelft said it’s not unusual for transformers to be purchased for scraping, however, there are strict rules and regulations that must be followed to dispose of the liquid inside them. “There are some strict things you need to do in terms of containing the liquid inside and making sure that doesn’t leak and also making sure that that liquid does not contain PCBs,” he said. “So, if you essentially get one of these transformers through maybe a demolition job, and you are able to get the liquids out and there is no PCB, then you certainly can take that transformer then to the scrap yard and with documentation, and scrap it.” In addition, officials will work to determine how the spill happened, and the intent associated with it to figure out the next steps and whether there will be implications for the person responsible. Assendelft said in the meantime, residents should stay out of the water until the spill is taken care of and to allow crews working on the spill to do their job.

Earlier Tuesday afternoon, the City of Midland was notified of a possible petroleum sheen about four to five miles long located upstream of Midland on the Pine River. After an onsite investigation, officials with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes & Energy (EGLE) have determined that the sheen is caused by motor oil leaking from heavy equipment at a residence in Saint Louis, Michigan. The sheen will be visible in the Pine and Tittabawassee rivers as it passes through Midland.

 Ashley Schafer, Ashley.Schafer@hearstnp.com Crews continue testing and clean-up efforts in and along Bush Creek, after a spill was identified in the Pine River Tuesday night in Midland County. Currently, there is no concern of contamination to municipal or private drinking water supplies, according to Gratiot County Emergency Management. “(Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy) partners want to emphasize the source of the release has been located, no further release is occurring, mitigation/remediation efforts are in place, and it has been determined there are no PCBs involved,” the county’s report states. The source of the liquid was discovered to be from a transformer, which a St. Louis area resident had purchased with the intent of scrapping for metal. He had emptied the dielectric fluid from inside the transformer into three 55-gallon drums, however, in the process, the fluid had leaked and made its way to the river via Bush Creek. Nick Assendelft, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environmental, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) said they were concerned the liquid contained PCBs, which are man-made chemicals known to cause adverse health effects in humans and animals. However, Initial lab results showed the liquid did not contain PCBs and additional lab tests came back Thursday confirming the initial tests. Further testing of samples is taking place to determine if the dielectric fluid, which is similar to mineral oil, contains any other chemicals. According to the report from Gratiot County Emergency Management Detective Dan Kennedy, (DNR) Environmental Investigation Section conducted a site investigation and interviews at the scene of the incident. It states the property owner/responsible party is fully cooperating with all authorities. In addition, booms, which are floating devices meant to contain spills, have been placed along Buch Creek and will remain in place until there is no more sheen on the water. The booms are on Bush Creek in Bethany Township and at North Baldwin Road, M-46 and North Blair Road. As of Thursday, Bierlien Companies, which offers environmental remediation services, is on site doing soil remediation and cleaning the area. Other entities who have been involved in the efforts include EGLE, DNR, Gratiot County Emergency Management, St Louis Area Fire Department, AKT Peerless, Consumers Energy, Gratiot County Central Dispatch/911, Midland County Emergency Management, and Midland County Central Dispatch/911. Assendelft said local emergency managers will make the call as to when they feel it’s safe for people to come into contact with the water once again.

 LAS VEGAS (AP) — State officials who monitor chemical contaminations at 40 sites in southern Nevada are now preparing for a large-scale cleanup at one that stemmed from a spill at a dry-cleaning shop decades ago. The Las Vegas Sun reports (http://bit.ly/29F2AWA ) that more than 200 homes sit atop a plume created years ago at a dry-cleaning operation. The cancer-causing chemical bled into groundwater after a 1982 spill, and officials say the plume now stretches more than a mile long. State regulators hope to begin extracting the perchloroethylene, or PCE, by spring of 2017. Recently they have installed mitigating systems to keep the chemical out of homes. Regulators are in the process of finalizing that plan with the former owners of the Maryland Square property, who were found responsible to pay for the cleanup. ___ Information from: Las Vegas Sun, http://www.lasvegassun.com

 RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Dominion Virginia Power could face financial penalties and reimbursement costs for a mineral oil spill that fouled a portion of the Potomac River, state environmental officials said Friday. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued a notice of violation for the spill, a first step to ensure that the power company is held accountable for the spill. A transformer failure at a substation in Crystal City led to the release of 13,500 gallons of mineral oil. The DEQ reports of a sheen on the river on Feb. 3. A portion of the spill eventually ended up along the banks of the Potomac River and in the river itself. DEQ said 29 fish and waterfowl were found dead after the spill. In a statement, Dominion said it had accepted responsibility for the spill, adding that "more than 95" percent of the oil had been recovered. The DEQ said the state can assess civil penalties at the rate $100 per gallon and require corrective reaction involving any environmental damage.

 GILLETTE, Wyo. (AP) — Officials say a pipeline leak that caused between 1,200 and 1,700 gallons of crude oil to spill into a creek near Gillette has been clamped to prevent further leakage. The Gillette News Record reports (http://bit.ly/20FxCzB ) that the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality has blamed the leak that was reported Sunday on internal corrosion of the pipeline. A spokesman for Belle Fourche Pipeline, Bill Salvin, says the company is still investigating the leak to determine an official cause. The oil had covered about a quarter mile of Timber Creek in northern Campbell County and leaked under a railroad and through a culvert. Belle Fourche employees worked to burn most of the oil out of the water Monday. Salvin says the cleanup will last a couple more days. ___ Information from: The Gillette (Wyo.)

ALTON — An overturned tanker truck on Monday morning ruptured and spilled diesel fuel into Wood River Creek in Alton. Alton Fire Chief Jesse Jemison said that, at about 5:50 a.m. Monday, the Alton Fire Department received a call about a semi-tanker carrying diesel fuel which had run off the Homer Adams Parkway Extension northbound. The truck overturned into a ditch near Wood River Creek, near the Circle K gas station in the Alton jurisdiction, about a quater mile north of East Broadway. The tanker appeared to have overturned while negotiating a curve, rolling down an embankment and landing on the edge of Wood River Creek. The tanker also struck a number of large rocks, which ruptured the tanker in multiple places. Materials also appeared to be leaking from a top hatch of the tanker. Containment measures were undertaken by the Alton Fire Department, and officials from the Madison County Hazardous Materials Team responded to the site, as did a team from ConocoPhillips’ Wood River Refinery which sent several firefighters and a foam truck. Members of Heritage Environmental Services (HES) also were at the site to aid with the clean-up. “As of right now, they’ve collected about 3,000 gallons of fuel,” Jemison said shortly before 10 a.m. Monday. A large pool of diesel fuel was seen near the truck. Jemison said some of the material from the tanker leaked into the creek. Firefighters used absorbent pads and booms in an effort to contain the spilled fuel, which formed a sheen on the creek. A vacuum truck, often used for large volume spills, also was called to the site to extract the pooled fuel. Four-wheelers and four-wheel-drive trucks were brought in to track the spill as it headed downstream. Alton and East Alton firefighters gathered on both banks at the mouth of the creek where it feeds into the Mississippi River, with firefighters using a rope gun to launch a line across the creek. Alton East firefighters and HES members then pulled a boom across the creek to contain the spilled diesel fuel and prevent it from traveling downstream. Another tanker truck was brought to the scene to offload the remaining diesel fuel in the damaged semi-tanker. The driver of the truck, who has not been identified, appeared not to be injured Monday. The roadway was closed well into Monday afternoon because of the accident and ensuing cleanup. Jemison said the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency had not yet been contacted, but will “more than likely” be involved. No other information was immediately Monday on the accident.

 CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Federal government scientists have released a final update of their study of the January 2014 chemical spill that temporarily fouled the drinking water supplies of 300,000 Charleston-area residents, reporting no significant new findings. The Charleston Gazette-Mail ( http://bit.ly/29uLXOS ) cited the report Friday as finding "most of the spilled chemicals had no effects in the studies that were performed" after the spill of coal-cleaning agent Crude MCHM at a Freedom Industries site near the Elk River that year. The work was conducted by the National Toxicology Program at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The newspaper said scientists found any potential for negative health effects would only occur at significantly higher doses than residents would have had in their water under a health advisory set up after the spill. One concern not addressed in the report is how dangerous inhalation of the chemical might be. Residents may have been exposed to airborne MCHM when they followed state-promoted guidelines for running hot and cold water to flush the chemical out of their pipes. Federal officials originally planned to study that and come up with a limit for how much MCHM is safe in the air, but they quickly abandoned the idea and no air sampling was done. John Bucher, associate director of the NTP, said in a phone interview, "We really had no clue about what kinds of levels of exposures were happening during the flushing." Bucher also said it's not clear why the federal study found skin irritation from the chemical only at very high exposure levels, while residents reported such effects as a common symptom when they sought medical help following the spill. NTP report also mentions a birth weight study performed by the state Department of Health and Human Resources. That report was posted on a state website but hasn't been widely publicized. It found no increase in the percentage of pre-term and low birth-weight babies born in the region affected by the spill.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources says about 2,500 fish were killed along nearly two miles of the creek northeast of Sutherland. That discovery came after an estimated 5,000 gallons of liquid manure was spilled Thursday afternoon at a hog operation. Officials say the owner quickly stopped the spill between two manure tanks and dammed an area above the creek to contain the spill. Officials say the fish killed were smaller species, including minnows, shiners, stonerollers and chubs. Live fish were also found in the stream.

 By DAN ELLIOTT Caption Close DENVER (AP) — Construction crews will return this weekend to the scene of a massive mine-waste spill in southwestern Colorado to stabilize the mine opening with steel and concrete, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday. The EPA said the work is designed to keep rock and dirt from collapsing at the entrance to the Gold King Mine and to make sure it's safe to enter during future cleanup efforts. The stabilization work will last through October. An EPA-led contractor inadvertently triggered a spill of 3 million gallons of wastewater from the Gold King on Aug. 5 while doing preliminary cleanup work. The blowout tainted rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah with potentially toxic heavy metals, prompting utilities and farmers to stop drawing from the waterways. The water quality quickly returned to pre-spill levels, the EPA says. In an email to The Associated Press, the EPA said it is very unlikely the work being done at the mine this year would trigger another spill. "The EPA has taken precautions to prevent any unanticipated discharges," the agency said. The contractor hired to do this summer's work, Environmental Restoration LLC, was also on the scene at the time of the August blowout. But the EPA and outside investigators have said it was government officials, not the contractor, who made the decision to begin the work that led to the spill. The EPA pledged to alert downstream communities if anything goes wrong this summer, using a notification plan put in place after the August blowout. The agency was widely criticized for not alerting all the tribal, state and local governments affected by the spill. Wastewater is still running from the mine, and if the rate increases during this summer's work, a temporary treatment plant installed last fall can handle a higher flow, the EPA said. The $1.8 million plant went into operation in October. Officials said at the time it could handle 800 gallons per minute, while wastewater was flowing from the mine at about 560 gallons per minute. The plant is scheduled to run through November of this year. Colorado lawmakers have urged the EPA to keep it operating, and the agency said Friday it is looking into that. The August blowout triggered lawsuits and intense criticism of the EPA, both for causing the spill and for its handling of the aftermath. The agency has proposed using the federal Superfund program to fund a long-term cleanup of the Gold King and other nearby mining sites. ___ Follow Dan Elliott at http://twitter.com/DanElliottAP.

 October 4, 2018 By Aaron Michell
Correspondent In 1958, Alpha Clark Jr. graduated from Michigan State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine.
Ever since, he has simply been known as “Doc”.
Doc grew up on the Clark family farm near Big Lake in Sears, Michigan. A good student, Clark was taught the importance of discipline and work ethic from a young age. Although he did enjoy the occasional game of ping-pong or boxing match as a youth, his parents, Alpha Sr. and Elsie, raised him under the instruction that if you’re not learning, you’d better be working.
And work he has.
Still going strong at age 84, Clark, along with his daughter Linda, run the Tri County Veterinary Clinic out of the same hospital that he built back in 1961. He still lives right next door, in the same house that he and his late wife, Marlene, spent most of their 48 years together.
In nearly 60 years of practice at his McBain shop, Doc has seen plenty.
He’s seen plenty of adventures: Such as the time he was squirted in the face by Denver Hughston’s rodeo skunk, upon attempting to remove its scent glands.
He’s seen plenty of heartache: it still makes him very sad having to put down any pet, because he knows empathy and he feels the hurt for the pet owner.
But he’s also seen plenty of good: There’s nothing more rewarding to him then to see an animal he’s treated get better.
And yet he’s also seen catastrophe.
In the 1970s, Doc Clark became internationally known during the PBB (polybrominated biphenyl) contamination crisis that affected so many Midwest farms during the decade. It was his intuition, know-how, and research while treating animals that led to the discovery of the PBB contaminated feed, and the subsequent crisis that devastated so many farms, while wiping out tens of thousands of livestock.
His years of research and analysis – some 12 boxes worth of detailed findings – is now available for study in the Clarke Historical Library on the campus of Central Michigan University. To this day, the effects of PBB continue to be examined – in both humans and livestock – with researchers all over the world relying on his data; data taken from many Missaukee and Osceola county farms that saw the catastrophe first hand.
And while Doc Clark’s PBB story could easily fill this newspaper – and perhaps it will soon – that’s not what his story is all about.
His story is about a simple country hick, who found love in his late wife Marlene. It’s a story about his kids: Alpha III, Linda, and David, and their kids too. It’s a story about a guy who loves his animals, loves farming, loves his community, and loves his work.
This is a story about a guy who’s much more than just another face in the crowd. Marion Press: Where were you born and raised?
Doc: When my parents got married, my dad worked for Buick in Flint. I think I was born there – that’s what my birth certificate says – but at the same time they bought a farm [near Sears]. Therefore, about 99 percent of my life was on that farm. I was 16 when I started my senior year, and 17 in January – graduated when I was 17. Went to Michigan State and got into vet school. When I graduated from vet school, it was 1958. Alpha “Doc” Clark stands next to the plant that was given to him at Marlene’s funeral. He waters it every day, keeping it alive and well for the past 14 years. MP: 60 years ago, that’s really something. Where did you go to school when you lived in Sears?
Doc: Back when they used to have those one-room schools, I went 7 years to the Covert School. And that building is now downtown in Barryton – they’ve got two [one-room schoolhouses] in that park in town. At my eighth year I went to Barryton Junior High, and then I graduated from Barryton High School. MP: And then you went to MSU, and eventually to vet school. Was being a vet something that you always wanted to be?
Doc: I think so. Let me tell ya why: Anytime an animal got hurt, I’d have to patch it up. Just as a kid. I don’t know, I felt sorry for the animal, or something. MP: What kind of farm did you grow up on?
Doc: Dairy cattle. We always had dairy cattle. MP: What brought you to McBain?
Doc: I knew these Dutch farmers were up here, and I knew they were good farmers – that’s what brought me up here. Actually, I spent three years in Evart [after graduating vet school] and we rented a house there. And I set up a little clinic where we could treat dogs and operate on them.
There was a vet up here [in McBain] and he was a good vet. And somehow, he quit and went to Paw Paw – his name was Doc Stewart. When he left, I come right up here.
The neighbor up here was Neil Noordhoek, and he told me that he’d sell me three acres right here, see. So, I bought three acres and I put this hospital up and it was the best thing I ever did. And I didn’t know it at the time – I wasn’t THAT smart. Doc Clark and Doctor Pol MP: I don’t believe that! So you built this place in ’61 and you’ve been here ever since? Almost 60 years of helping animals right here.
Doc: Ever since. Sooner or later, you’re gonna find out – that no matter how old you are – that it went so fast, that you can’t believe it yourself. I mean, I can’t believe I’m that old.
The only difference was that I’ve treated so many cows – pregnancy exam, and I’d just treat ‘em – that I hurt my back. I think it’s just a work deal, and I’ve had a lot of back trouble. So, I decided that I better get out of the cow business or I wouldn’t be able to walk! MP: Cows are big animals!
Doc: I know it! And horses, I still do what they call the Coggins test. They bring ‘em here, and I bleed ‘em and then we send the results to the state. That’s for infectious equine anemia – the common name is swamp fever. MP: Can you tell us a little bit about your family?
Doc: I’ve got three kids: two boys and Linda. My boys are Alpha III – my dad’s name was Alpha – and the youngest is David. David works for a milk company as a fuel man, and he lives over here in the house just down the road. I eat breakfast with him every morning.
You see, after I bought this, [Noordhoek] wanted to sell me the rest of the farm. It’s 120 acres. MP: What is your favorite part of being a vet?
Doc: I just like the work. My parents taught me that work ethic, and if I’m not working, I’m not happy – and that’s stupid. I can’t help it! Some people are addicted to this or that, and the way my parents taught me, I’d imagine I’m addicted to work. I suspect I am. he Clarks at Marion Fair MP: Well most people 84 years old have long ago retired.
Doc: Yep, well I don’t wanna retire. I live right here in this house over there. After we built this [hospital] we built this house [behind the hospital].
I lost my wife, Marlene, in 2004 – there’s the plant from her funeral. That plant’s 14 years old. I’ve got to tell ya, she was the finest human being you ever met. Believe me. She was very religious, but not to the point where she’d pound it on ya – if you wanted to talk about it, okay, and if you didn’t, now that’s okay too. Just the goodness of her.
She was the best thing that ever happened to me. We were married 48 years, and if she was still alive we’d still be married. She was a heck of a woman. She was a sweet gal – blonde hair, and light complexion.
Marlene Evelyn Peterson. Her family lived 6 miles south of the gravel pit near Hersey – it’s called Grant Center. MP: How did you and Marlene meet?
Doc: It’s the [darndest] thing you ever heard of. I was going to Michigan State, and my cousin John was going to church in Lansing– our church was the Church of God – and they had youth meetings on Wednesday night. And Marlene had gone to Anderson, Indiana to a Church of God college, but her two sisters still lived in Lansing, and went to that church.
And I was a pretty good ping-pong player when I was young – ain’t worth nothing right now, because you’ve got to be able to move. And I like to play yet, but not like I was then – I could just about whip anybody. Anyway, [John] couldn’t beat this guy [at the church] and he talked me into going to this church deal. And when I got there he wanted me to play this guy – and he didn’t tell me that.
I don’t remember if I won or not; I probably did. That was in the spring. The following fall, I went back to school and I started going to the church and sitting right ahead of me was Marlene and her two sisters.
And she was the prettiest thing I ever seen. You know how that goes. That’s how I met Marlene, in the church.
She was one terrific gal. She probably did more for me than any one person’s ever done for anybody.
See, I was a country hick kid. MP: A country hick kid, huh?
Doc: I’ll tell ya a story: One of the courses that we had to take at MSU was zoology. I knew that in order to get into vet school, you’d better do good in zoology. And so I was taking the class, and I got the flu. And I couldn’t take one of the tests. So I went to the [professor] and he said, well come on in and I’ll give you the test. And I scored the highest in the class. And right then, he said to me: I thought you was a country hick.
He did! Honest. And I was. He helped me get into vet school. I don’t know what it’s like now [to get in], but back then it was a pistol. MP: Being here for as long as you have, what have been some of the keys to being successful?
Doc: Well I don’t take off every day; I don’t take off. I work five days a week. And someone come to the door the other day and wanted something. I think it was Sunday; they were having trouble and so I just come over here and took care of ‘em.
And when you’re 84, you’ve got to take a little time, get a little rest. But I just come over and took care of ‘em.
It all starts out with your parents – it’s got to start that way. My parents taught me to be honest, and to work. Well you put them two things together, and that’s what I think I am; I think I’m that. But nobody’s perfect, believe me. Linda with her prized holstein MP: Outside of being a vet, what keeps you busy?
Doc: Well, I’ve got the registered Holstein herd. We’ve had that herd for a long time. Probably shortly after I graduated from vet school I started getting’ ‘em. You’ll look out here and see some cattle: them are bred heifers or dry cows.
Linda, her husband, and her son take care of the farm. Now, if you know where Big Lake [in Sears] is, our farm is right there on the north side. We own the farm right north of the lake.
We milk about 60 cows, and all together we have about 130 head. And they’re all registered, and we’ve been doing it since about 1960 – so that’s a lot of generations we’ve been doing it.
Our farm name is Clydal. His name is Clyde, and mine is Alpha; Clydal Farm. MP: Who have been some of your mentors or role models?
Doc: My mother and dad. You’ve got to think about that. They taught me the main ingredients of survival: You’ve got to be honest, and you work hard. And that will just about get you anywhere, if you work hard and you’re honest. Alpha and Elsie. Elsie Ellen – she was a tough gal, now. You didn’t mess with my mother, she’d wallop ya! She taught me discipline and she taught me to be honest. MP: What is the best advice that you’ve been given?
Doc: Well I think, still, being honest and working. In your own occupation, if you’re honest, and you work hard – it’s about the only way you’re gonna get ahead in this world. MP: What kind of advice would you give to a kid, or someone who wants to be a vet?
Doc: I’d tell them that they better buckle down and get ready to work. You better learn to work, and you better be honest. You don’t fool people; sooner or later, you don’t fool people.
The one thing I have learnt, believe it or not, is to keep my mouth shut. You’re gonna learn a lot more listening than you will talking.
Marlene, she deserves a [heck] of a lot of credit. She took this country hick and made a man out of me – or maybe a boy out of me, I don’t know what – but she made a better human being out of me. She really did. var icx_publication_id = 13527; var icx_copyright_notice = 'Copyright 2018 The Marion Press'; var icx_content_id = '18610'; Click here for reuse options! Lisa S Auch Reply February 11, 2020 at 5:41 pm I absolutely LOVE Doc he is a character but most importantly he is COMPASSIONATE,FAIR AND HONEST!! His daughter Linda is just as awesome, seems that ole’ saying, the apple does not fall far from the tree! LOVE THEM BOTH! I asked Doc once, “With all your medical knowledge and determination can’t you figure out a way to stay alive forever?” He laughed and in his humble way he said “I am not that smart!” I told him “I CANNOT imagine this world without him!” Maggie Mieske Reply October 5, 2018 at 2:51 am Thank you for writing this article and transcribing your interview. I could hear his voice as I read it! I sure do love Doc Clark. He’s helped us save many critters over the years. Without going bankrupt! I love talking to him and one day learned he had gone to vet school with my childhood vet, Doc Sadilek. We swapped stories. Good times. In 1958, MSU put out some great vets!

 By oht_editor | on February 16, 2020 NORTH BRANCH TWP. — Environmentalists, the Michigan Attorney General, and many others are keeping an eye on the process of replacing Line 5 at the Straits of Mackinac. Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 is the pipeline that crosses the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan to transport oil and liquid natural gases from western Canada to Sarnia, Ontario — home to more than 60 chemical plants and oil refineries in a 15-mile-wide section outside town that’s come to be known regionally as “Chemical Valley.” Line 5 is a 645-mile pipeline, constructed in 1953 and currently owned by Enbridge. It begins in Superior, Wis., and ends in Sarnia. In addition to the Straits of Mackinac, Line 5 goes under another body of water in the Great Lakes — one much closer to Lapeer County. It also runs below the St. Clair River, just south of Lake Huron. Line 5’s route from northern Michigan to Sarnia takes it across northern Lapeer County — in a northwest to southeast direction — in a path from Tuscola County into St. Clair County enroute from the Upper Peninsula to refineries in Sarnia. The pipeline passes just north of the village of North Branch and proceeds southeast into Goodland Township. According to Enbridge, Line 5 carries approximately 540,000 barrels a day of light crude and natural gas liquids. The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter through Lapeer County. A spokesman for Enbridge says the pipeline replacement below the St. Clair River is part of trying to allay any concerns about the safety of Line 5. “Well, it really goes back to our agreement with the state. And this is one part of those agreements where we are going above and beyond for safety, really, and just making what’s been a safe pipeline there even safer and doing what we call a horizontal directional drill that will move the pipeline below the lake bed,” said Ryan Duffy with Enbridge. The existing 65-year-old pipeline was installed in a trench dug five feet below the riverbed. The new 2,800-foot section pipe will be deeper. “It’ll be about 30 feet or so below the lake bed there at the St. Clair River,” Duffy said. Once the new river crossing is drilled, the new pipe string will be pulled from the Canadian side back to the U.S. side of the river on or around April 27. Following the “pull-back”, a second hydrostatic test will be performed with the pipe in place. Just nine years ago Enbridge used the same method to replace the length of Line 6B under the St. Clair River right next to where its crews are working now. Line 6B was the pipeline that leaked hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into a creek and eventually the Kalamazoo River near Marshall in 2010. It was the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history. Source: MichiganRadio.org and County Press Editor Jeff Hogan.

For more photos, go to www.ourmidland.com. (Katy Kildee/kkildee@mdn.net) Firefighters from multiple local fire departments work to contain a spill on Pine River near S. Woodcock Road Tuesday in Midland. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy determined the An oily spill discovered in Pine River on Tuesday has been determined not to contain PCBs, which are a man-made chemical known to cause adverse health effects for humans. Nick Assendelft, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), said the spill was dielectric fluid, which is used as a coolant, that leaked from a transformer. A St. Louis area resident had obtained the transformer in the hopes of scrapping the metal and while transferring the liquid inside to three 55-gallon drums, some of it leaked out and made its way to the river. Other news outlets, such as the Morning Sun newspaper, have reported the property was located on East Jackson Road and the spill made its way to the river via Bush Creek. Wednesday afternoon, the spill had been determined not to contain PCBs, which is a good thing, Assendelft said, though the spill is still a concern for EGLE. PCB, polychlorinated biphenyls, are a group of man-made chemicals with no smell or taste used in industrial processes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, PCB is known to cause a variety of adverse health effects and are known to cause cancer in animals. “The fact that there are no PCBs makes it a lot better situation at this point,” Assendelft said. He said the spill has been contained and there is no further leakage at this time. Crews continue to work on cleaning up the spill. Tuesday afternoon, the City of Midland was made aware of a liquid sheen on the water surface that was four to five miles long. Midland County 911 issued a warning to residents that is still in effect, to avoid Pine River near Woodcock and Prairie roads, extending the warning to the Tittabawasse and Chippewa Rivers as well. EGLE has been working with local officials in Midland and Gratiot counties to investigate and capture the liquid using vacuum equipment. A couple hundred gallons of water has been captured, which partially contains the liquid. However, crews are currently trying to determine details, such as how much of the fluid was in the transformer to begin with, to understand how much is still left to capture and clean up. “Some of this might have been captured on site just because it spilled onto the ground so that’s another thing we need to determine, is how much conceivably spilled onto the ground and is contained in the soil, and if we need to do soil remediation,” Assendelft said Wednesday. “And then how much of this spilled into the river? So, that is something that we’re trying to determine today – the capacity of the transformer, how much was captured and then essentially what is left and what happens to that.” Assendelft said it’s not unusual for transformers to be purchased for scraping, however, there are strict rules and regulations that must be followed to dispose of the liquid inside them. “There are some strict things you need to do in terms of containing the liquid inside and making sure that doesn’t leak and also making sure that that liquid does not contain PCBs,” he said. “So, if you essentially get one of these transformers through maybe a demolition job, and you are able to get the liquids out and there is no PCB, then you certainly can take that transformer then to the scrap yard and with documentation, and scrap it.” In addition, officials will work to determine how the spill happened, and the intent associated with it to figure out the next steps and whether there will be implications for the person responsible. Assendelft said in the meantime, residents should stay out of the water until the spill is taken care of and to allow crews working on the spill to do their job.

Woodcock Road Tuesday in Midland. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy determined the An oily spill discovered in Pine River on Tuesday has been determined not to contain PCBs, which are a man-made chemical known to cause adverse health effects for humans. Nick Assendelft, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), said the spill was dielectric fluid, which is used as a coolant, that leaked from a transformer. A St. Louis area resident had obtained the transformer in the hopes of scrapping the metal and while transferring the liquid inside to three 55-gallon drums, it has leaked out and made its way to the river. Other news outlets, such as the Morning Sun newspaper, have reported the property was located on East Jackson Road and the spill made its way to the river via Bush Creek. Wednesday afternoon the spill had been determined not to contain PCBs, which is a good thing, Assendelft said, though the spill is still a concern for EGLE. PCB, polychlorinated biphenyls, are a group of man-made chemicals with no smell or taste used in industrial processes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, PCB is known to cause a variety of adverse health effects and are known to cause cancer in animals. “The fact that there are no PCBs makes it a lot better situation at this point,” Assendelft said. In addition, he said the spill has been contained and there is no further leakage at this time. Crews continue to work on cleaning up the spill. Tuesday afternoon, the City of Midland was made aware of the liquid sheen on the water surface that was four to five miles long. Midland County 911 issued a warning to residents that is still in effect, to avoid Pine River near Woodcock and Prairie roads, extending the warning to the Tittabawasse and Chippewa Rivers as well. EGLE has been working with local officials in Midland and Gratiot counties to investigate and capture the liquid using vacuum equipment. A couple hundred gallons of water has been captured, which partially contains the liquid. However, crews are currently trying to determine details, such as how much of the fluid was in the transformer to begin with, to understand how much is still left to capture and clean up. “Some of this might have been captured on site just because it spilled onto the ground so that’s another thing we need to determine, is how much conceivably spilled onto the ground and is contained in the soil, and if we need to do soil remediation,” Assendelft said Wednesday. “And then how much of this spilled into the river? So, that is something that we’re trying to determine today – the capacity of the transformer, how much was captured and then essentially what is left and what happens to that.” Assendelft said it’s not unusual for transformers to be purchased for scraping, however, there are strict rules and regulations that must be followed to dispose of the liquid inside them. “There are some strict things you need to do in terms of containing the liquid inside and making sure that doesn’t leak and also making sure that that liquid does not contain PCBs,” he said. “So, if you essentially get one of these transformers through maybe a demolition job, and you are able to get the liquids out and there is no PCB, then you certainly can take that transformer then to the scrap yard and with documentation, and scrap it.” In addition, officials will work to determine how the spill happened, and the intent associated with it to figure out the next steps and whether there will be implications for the person responsible. Assendelft said in the meantime, residents should stay out of the water until the spill is taken care of and to allow crews working on the spill to do their job.

 BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division reports a valve leak has spilled 105,000 gallons of treated produced water in northwestern North Dakota. The release was reported Monday at Justin SWD 1 saltwater disposal well, about five miles (eight kilometers) southwest of Tioga. Bosque Disposal System, LLC reported Tuesday that 2,500 barrels of treated produced water was released due to a valve/piping connection leak. The product was contained on-site and at the time of reporting all of the spill had been recovered. A state inspector has been to the location and will monitor any additional cleanup required. The produced water was mixed with hydrochloric acid which was neutralized with sodium bicarbonate as part of the cleanup. Hydrochloric acid is a commonly used acid in oil and gas production.

 CLEVELAND, N.C. (AP) — Officials in North Carolina say that corrosion in a pipeline led to 45,000 gallons of raw sewage spilling near a creek. The Raleigh News & Observer reported that the sewage spilled on Tuesday into a low-lying area near Swift Creek in Johnston County. The creek eventually runs into the Neuse River. A press release from Johnston County said the cause of the spill was a “pipeline material failure." The county recovered about 180,000 gallons of combined sewage and rainwater and pumped into the county’s wastewater treatment process. Officials said the cause of the corrosion hasn’t been determined. The iron pipe will be replaced with PVC pipe.

 BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A semitractor-trailer slid on icy roads and crashed into a guardrail in south-central Montana, causing the cab to go into the river and the load of toilet paper to be strewn across the highway, Red Lodge Fire and Rescue said. The driver suffered minor injuries in Monday morning's crash and 100 gallons (379 liters) or less of diesel fuel spilled into the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River near Belfry, officials said. The driver lost control of the rig while approaching an S-curve on Montana Highway 72, officials said. The semi hit the end of a bridge guardrail, splitting the cab from the trailer. The cab went through a barbed-wire fence and traveled halfway across the river, but stayed on its wheels, the Montana Highway Patrol said. The water was just a couple feet deep. Rescuers in dry suits were able to get the driver back to shore. The trailer and the spilled toilet paper narrowed traffic down to a single lane, the patrol said. Roads in the area have been icing up on recent mornings, Trooper Andrew Barbera told The Billings Gazette. The driver, who is not from Montana, told investigators he was unaware of the curve in the road. “It was essentially a solid sheet of ice," Barbera said Tuesday.

 Associated Press FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The state of Florida is fining the city of Fort Lauderdale $1.8 million for a series of massive sewage spills that have sent sent toxic sewage onto streets and into waterways since December. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection sent a letter to Mayor Dean Trantalis on Tuesday notifying him of the fine, the South Florida SunSentinel reported. The deadline for paying the fine is March 31. Officials said 212 million gallons (800 million liters) of sewage has flowed into waterways and neighborhoods in Fort Lauderdale, killing fish and leaving foul smells. The mayor had hoped for no fine at all, so that the money could be invested instead in fixing the faulty pipes. “The state should realize the problems all of its cities have (with aging sewer pipes),” Trantalis told the newspaper. “Fort Lauderdale is not alone.” But Gov. Ron DeSantis asked the environmental agency's secretary, Noah Valenstein, to pursue every available penalty. “Those that spew untreated wastewater into Florida’s water bodies need to be deterred from doing so by appropriate penalties,” DeSantis said. The state rejected the practice of allowing the city to comply with penalties by spending the fines on its own sewer repairs because Fort Lauderdale has a history of siphoning money from the utility fund to pay for pensions, salaries and parks, Valenstein said. “Fort Lauderdale is an example where you had aging infrastructure not adequately addressed by the municipality," Valenstein told the SunSentinel. "When we don’t have a big enough stick, it allows folks sometimes to make the wrong decisions and not invest in infrastructure.” He said it's the largest untreated wastewater spill in Florida's history. “Look at the impact that it’s had on the community and ask yourself whether the penalties that we’ve had in place for decades made sense," Valenstein said. “Clearly this is something that has impacted our communities.” A DeSantis spokeswoman said the state could sue if the city doesn't pay the fine on time. The mayor said he doesn't know how they'll pay it. “I don’t know the answer," Trantalis said. “We don’t have $1.8 million sitting around.” A consent order approved in 2017 after an earlier series of spills laid out $117.5 million in required sewer system repairs and improvements through 2026, and provided for state fines of $10,000 a day in the event of future spills of more than 100,000 gallons (378,500 liters). The fines announced Tuesday include $341,500 for recent sewage spills, a civil penalty of nearly $1.5 million and $5,000 in administrative costs. The money will be deposited into a statewide water quality assurance trust fund and can be appropriated by the Legislature to water-related projects across the state, the SunSentinel reported. The city's pipe system broke six times in December and there were additional spills over a 10-day period in January and early February. “We are at a crisis level,” the mayor said before learning of the fine. “We are now suffering the long-term consequences (of long-neglected infrastructure maintenance). It’s shameful.”

 IDANHA, Ore. (AP) — A stretch of Highway 22 will be closed for much of this week as crews clean up gasoline and diesel fuel that leaked out of a crashed tanker truck near Idanha along the North Santiam River, state transportation authorities said Monday. The highway between Idanha and Santiam Junction is unlikely to reopen until Friday or Saturday as crews remove contaminated soil in a roadside ditch and rebuild a 600-foot (183-meter) section of roadway, the Oregon Department of Transportation said. An oil sheen was visible on the North Santiam River downstream of the crash site, but officials said most of the tanker's oil seeped into the ditch, where it was absorbed by the soil. It's unclear how much entered the river, the Statesman Journal reported. The city of Salem said Monday that its drinking water is safe and the oil from the spill has not reached its water treatment plant near Stayton, which is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) away from the crash. The oil will take several days to reach the plant, the city said, and teams will test the river water at multiple locations this week. Crews have set up absorbent berms to capture the oil on the water. If any fuel is detected in the river, the city will close the water intake gates as it did in a similar situation three years ago. The crash on Sunday closed Highway 22 near Detroit and Santiam Junction. The truck was carrying 10,600 gallons (40,125 liters) of fuel total — 6,500 gallons (24,600 liters) of gasoline in a tanker trailer and 4,100 gallons (15,520 liters) of diesel in the truck's tanker. About 7,800 gallons (29,500 liters) of fuel emptied into a roadside ditch and the rest was recovered, according to Oregon Department of Environmental Quality officials.

 FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Fort Lauderdale officials say 211.6 million gallons of sewage has spilled into Fort Lauderdale waterways in the past few months. The Sun-Sentinel reports that’s enough to fill 320 Olympic-sized pools. The city’s aging sewer pipes broke six times in December and spewed 126.9 million gallons of sewage — ranking as one of South Florida’s biggest spills ever. The spills fouled the Tarpon River, the Himmarshee Canal and streets in three neighborhoods. According to what officials told the state Department of Environmental Protection, 79.3 million gallons spilled into George English Lake over a 10-day period that began Jan. 30 and ended Feb. 8. Then an additional 5.4 million gallons flooded streets near park right across from a popular mall. In recent weeks, crews also have rushed to fix another string of water main breaks, forcing the city to warn residents to boil their tap water before drinking, brushing their teeth or washing dishes.

 Janet Mcconnaughey, Associated Press NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Louisiana will get $130 million in BP oil spill money to link its second-largest coastal swamp back up to the Mississippi River, and Alabama will receive funds to add up to 12,000 acres (4,800 hectares) to a wildlife management area. The RESTORE Council, made up of officials from the five Gulf states and several federal agencies, voted for the projects on Wednesday. The group was created to allocate money from Clean Water Act fines paid by BP and others after the catastrophic 2010 spill. The amount approved for Alabama's project was not immediately available. Louisiana's grant will go toward a system designed to deliver fresh water and sediment from the Mississippi River into the Maurepas Swamp about 30 miles (49 kilometers) west-northwest of New Orleans. Because levees cut it off from the Mississippi River and salt sometimes gets in through canals and nearby Lake Pontchartrain, the baldcypress and tupelo gum trees that make it a swamp have been dying for decades. Marsh grasses have taken over some areas and others have become open water. “The Maurepas Swamp is not just an amazing and beautiful swamp and Wildlife Management Area, but it is also a crucial, natural buffer between hurricane winds and storm surge,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said at a news conference livestreamed from Baton Rouge. "If we let this swamp continue to die off we would be putting many large communities in this region at increased risk." The project is the biggest so far in Louisiana's coastal restoration program, and will benefit 45,000 acres (18,200 hectares) of swamp, officials said. The money will be available once all engineering, design, and permitting requirements are met, according to news releases. “This is the first time we have ever attempted to connect a coastal forest to the river,” said Chip Kline, chairman of Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority. The Restore the Mississippi Delta coalition praised the action. “Louisiana, once known for its abundant swamps, has increasingly become known for ‘ghost swamps’ devoid of life and productivity. We must act with urgency to protect what remaining swamp habitat exists for the benefit of wildlife and people in our state and across the nation,” the coalition said in a news release. The council also voted to support Alabama's Perdido River Land Conservation and Habitat Enhancements Project, said Lauren C. Bourg, spokeswoman for Restore the Mississippi Delta. That project would add 10,000 to 12,000 acres (4,000 to 4,800 hectares) to the Perdido Wildlife Management Area, and could be used for longleaf pine restoration, benefiting species including gopher tortoises, according to Alabama's proposal. Money is coming from a trust fund set up by the RESTORE Act for 80% of the water pollution penalties paid after July 2012 by companies involved in the 2010 spill. A well that BP PLC was drilling from the Deepwater Horizon rig blew in April 2010, killing 11 men. It took nearly three months to cap the well, which spewed an estimated 134 million gallons (507 million liters) of oil during the nation’s worst offshore oil spill.

The crash happened on the northbound side of Interstate 89 in New London, New Hampshire, just after 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. Police said the box truck for Bellavance Beverage Company lost control and struck another vehicle before driving off the roadway and overturning onto its side in the median. Photos from the scene show all the contents inside the truck, which included dozens of cases of beer and even some beer kegs spilled across the median of the road. No one was hurt. Police said the truck was traveling too fast for the road conditions at the time. Investigators said there was a mix of rain and snow falling at the time, with other crashes reported in the area at the same time. Police said the removal of the box truck and spillage of materials caused the left lane to be closed for several hours. The crash was under investigation by police.

 BAYTOWN, Texas (AP) — A 630-gallon (2,385-liter) oil spill in a bay on the eastern outskirts of Houston has been contained and is being cleaned from the water, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday. Coast Guard Petty Officer Paige Hause said the mile-long (1.6-kilometer-long) spill occurred Saturday at Baytown from a wellhead that was closed and abandoned in 1980s, but it is unclear who the current owner is. “That's still part of the investigation ... to determine who the responsible party is,” Hause said. Hause said the spill is not considered large, but the health and environmental impact has not been determined, with surveys of the area now underway. Hause said an absorbent material has been spread along the shoreline of the bay and oil is being vacuumed from the water. The efforts seek to keep oil out of the Houston Ship Channel, which was closed nearly a year ago after flammable chemicals from a petrochemical storage facility seeped into what is one of America's busiest shipping lanes. Environmental officials with Harris County, the state of Texas and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did not immediately return phone calls for comment.

 Diane Dupuis is the new development director at FLOW (For Love Of Water), the Traverse City-based organization dedicated to preserving the waters of the Great Lakes basin. She previously spent ten years at Interlochen Center for the Arts in communications and fund-development roles before fundraising for two land conservancies. She joins FLOW at a propitious time; the organization has been in the forefront of two high-profile legal fights. One concerns the drawing of water by Nestle in Mecosta County, and the other is the dispute over Line 5 running under the Straits of Mackinac.Northern Express sits down with Dupuis to talk ground water, high water, water justice, and the critical flow that moves — or drains — the people’s fight: money. What is your background?I’m the daughter of two Detroit Public Schools educators and social justice activists. I grew up in the Detroit area, attended Kalamazoo College, and worked in Detroit’s publishing sector for the first part of my career. In 2001 my husband, musician Steve Carey, and I relocated to the Traverse City area with our two small children, and I began working at Interlochen Center for the Arts, first in communications and then in fundraising. From there I joined the fund development staff at the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy. When my elderly mom needed looking after downstate, I was able to make that transition by working in development in Ann Arbor, at Legacy Land Conservancy and then the Ann Arbor Art Center. My nonprofit experience also includes service on the boards of Michigan Writers and Washtenaw Literacy, and I currently serve as vice chair of Michigan Audubon. I’m a hiker, cross-country skier, and sea kayaker equally mesmerized by campfires, star-gazing, and rock-strewn beaches. So why FLOW? Like many lifelong Michiganians as well as those who embrace Michigan later in life, I feel a fundamental connection to our waters, and along with that a conviction that we all share a responsibility for safeguarding this precious asset. In addition to the beauty and grandeur of our waters, and along with the recreational delights and the wildlife habitat they afford, our water is also crucial to human health. Access to clean drinking water is a universal need, and I can’t think of a more important issue facing us at this time than water justice. In working to keep public water publicly available, FLOW collaborates with many partners throughout the Great Lakes states and Canadian provinces from right here in the Grand Traverse region, a water-lover’s paradise. FLOW is the right place for me to roll up my sleeves and live my values, inspired every day amidst a landscape defined by water. Where does FLOW get its funding? Why does FLOW need a development director?FLOW is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that depends on charitable donations to fund our work. Financial support comes from individuals, corporate sponsors, and foundations throughout the Great Lakes basin. We also benefit from the time and expertise that volunteers devote to our effort, everything from helping to make our office run smoothly to pro bono legal work. Midwesterners are particularly generous in supporting causes they believe in, and our region is fortunate to sustain a bright constellation of very worthy organizations working to enhance lives. At FLOW, one aspect of my job is to help ensure that everyone who cares about water justice in the Great Lakes can, with their generosity, participate in moving FLOW’s work forward. Another aspect is to help supporters appreciate how their generosity makes a positive difference in protecting public water from private interests. The part of each day that I most look forward to is thanking all the committed and insightful people who pitch in with energy, resources, and hope. Two of the biggest issues around water and FLOW are Line 5 and Nestle’s continued drawing water. What is the latest on those? As long as the multinational Enbridge Energy continues to operate Line 5 (a major oil pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac), a massive area of the Great Lakes is at risk of a catastrophic oil spill. Last spring, Michigan’s Attorney General Dana Nessel ruled that previous laws and agreements with Enbridge were unconstitutional, invalid, and unenforceable. In June, Enbridge filed suit in the Court of Claims in Lansing against the State of Michigan and its departments to resuscitate the oil tunnel deal. FLOW is providing crucial legal and science support to the effort to decommission the Line 5 pipeline by forcing compliance with environmental and public trust laws. Earlier this fall, the Michigan Court of Claims issued orders accepting FLOW’s and the City of Mackinac Island’s amicus briefs, which reject opposing arguments by Enbridge. The ruling means that vital issues raised by FLOW’s “friend of the court” brief and the city’s brief will be considered by the Michigan Court of Claims, including the public trust rights of citizens to draw drinking water from and otherwise use the Great Lakes, and the soils and bottomlands beneath them, unimpaired by private interests. Also, the fight to keep public water from being sold for private profit remains a focus for FLOW. Private landowners have a right to reasonable use of water for the benefit of their land. But reasonable use does not mean robbing large volumes of water from the headwaters of our streams, lakes, and wetlands—water taken for free and sold elsewhere for private gain. While Nestle pays $200 a year to extract 210 million gallons of water that belongs to everyone, people in our communities have lost access to clean, affordable drinking water. A multinational water bottler’s excessive profiteering doesn’t sit well when people in Flint reel from the lack of access to water safe from the risk of lead poisoning, or tens of thousands of people in Detroit continue to suffer the indignity and harm to families and health from water shutoffs because they cannot afford the high price of water to meet their basic needs, or communities throughout the state wrestle with groundwater contamination from PFAS and other pollutants. What water issues are we dealing with (or ignoring) in this region?Michigan is “The Great Lakes State” but is a failing steward of the sixth Great Lake, the water lying beneath Michigan’s ground. FLOW is calling for state-level reforms to strengthen protection of Michigan’s groundwater. That includes statewide monitoring and replacement of failing septic systems. Michigan prides itself on being an environmental leader, particularly in curbing water pollution. But in one area of water policy, Michigan is dead last among the 50 states: It is the only state in the nation that lacks a uniform sanitary code requiring periodic inspection and maintenance of septic systems – even though 30 percent of Michiganians rely on such systems. An estimated 130,000 septic systems in the state are failing, releasing 5.2 billion gallons of sewage annually into Michigan waters. Numerous Michigan rivers and lakes have detectable levels of human fecal bacteria. Groundwater, too, is contaminated by septic wastes. This issue needs more attention throughout Michigan. What is the deal with the high water levels? How will this affect us going forward?Scientists don’t know whether Great Lakes levels will rise or fall in response to climate change, as increases in precipitation may be offset by increased evaporation from higher temperatures and reduced ice cover. Climate science makes clear, though, that the frequency and severity of storm events will increase the potential for unprecedented, rapid changes in Great Lakes levels. We only have to look back six years or so to a time when water levels in 2013 were significantly lower than average, compared to the high levels we see today. This dramatic fluctuation in water levels is yet another sign of the climate crisis that is evidenced by extremes of all kinds: storms, droughts, floods, wildfires, polar melting, record-breaking temperatures, and more. Is avian botulism still a thing Up North?Avian botulism kills diving ducks and loons, often as they begin their migratory flight to winter habitat. The numbers are down from a high in 2012 or thereabouts. Of the six or so bird carcasses collected in the Sleeping Bear Dunes area this fall, I’m told that avian botulism was detected in about half.Where else does FLOW work? Are there other Great Lakes efforts we should be aware of in this area?Around the Great Lakes, which contain roughly 20 percent of the world’s available surface fresh water, old and failing infrastructure, urbanization, intense agricultural uses, runoff and many more sources are threatening water quality. For specific localities around the region, “OUR20” is a FLOW initiative that empowers local communities to instill the values of water stewardship in their policies and practices. This grassroots, place-based program is built on the knowledge that water is precious to all, and its stewardship has the potential to unite communities in achieving environmental goals. Any community can adopt the “OUR20” model. How can people can get involved/take action?Becoming and staying informed is fundamental, and FLOW’s twice-monthly e-newsletter is a great place to start. It highlights issues and events, and offers information on specific actions that individuals can undertake to increase their involvement and create change. Sign up is easy, at flowforwater.org/get-involved/sign-up-here/. We also encourage citizens to follow us on Facebook to stay abreast of water news on a daily basis. Follow us here: Facebook.com/FlowforWater. FLOW also welcomes volunteers for a range of activities. And, of course, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t mention our website’s donation page: https://flowforwater.org/donate/ Is water the next precious commodity? What does than mean for the Great Lakes? Nature and ecological systems provide trillions of dollars in annual benefits to humanity. The Great Lakes and their tributary rivers and streams, wetlands, and groundwater – the largest fresh surface water system in the world – are an immense source of natural capital that will become increasingly valuable as the accumulating effects of climate change stress the global environment, and worsening water scarcity draws attention to the water wealth of the Great Lakes region. As populations shift to water-rich regions, infrastructure and water justice will become increasingly critical, as will the imperative to keep public water publicly available. What's needed most right now? Where should the general public be putting forth their time, energy and money? Water is at the nexus of food, energy, transportation, the climate crisis, social justice, and the economy. Solutions based on law and science can prevail with public support.ART, MEET WATER (AND FUNDRAISING SUCCESS)Part art exhibit, part fundraiser, and all about the water, Higher Art Gallery’s “Source: Artists for FLOW” exhibit recently featured 32 pieces — created by 21 different artists — connected to and/or commentaries on the region’s land and water. Thanks to proceeds from the opening night event and works sold, the gallery raised $4,500 for FLOW. The event and exhibit were not only one of two fundraisers gallery owner Shanny Brooke creates each year to give back to the community but also proof of how effectively art and water can work together — a foundation FLOW communications coordinator Jacob Wheeler said feeds FLOW’s new Art Meets Water initiative. “It’s clear that one of the most important ways to connect with water is to connect emotionally,” he said. And art appeals to the emotions. “Literature, music, dance, poetry, and art all come into play. To get people to think more of water and what FLOW does, [art] is a great tool.” The organization’s new Art Meets Water hub features inspirational tools aplenty: a groundwater video that includes a painting by Glenn Wolff and narration by Anne-Marie Oomen; photos of the artists and their work at Higher Art Gallery; Oomen's "Love Letters to the Lakes," presented to the International Joint Commission this summer; and video of Crispin Campbell and Michael Delp's cello-poetry collaboration at FLOW’s “In Praise of Water” benefit last June at the Cathedral Barn in the Commons.

 Michigan said no to Enbridge Inc.’s Line 5 by electing a governor who promised to decommission the pipeline that threatens our Great Lakes. The backroom deal that former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder made with Enbridge, a Canadian multinational energy transportation company based in Calgary, Alberta, called for a new Line 5 in a tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac, ignoring the advice of his own safety board. The agreement says Michigan will own the oil tunnel upon completion and lease it to Enbridge for 99 years. But now that state Attorney General Dana Nessel has filed suit to begin the process of decommissioning Line 5, a new backroom deal is brewing. A bill supporting the Enbridge tunnel is expected to be introduced in Michigan’s House of Representatives soon. Every lawmaker in Michigan agrees that the Great Lakes are our most precious asset and need to be protected. Yet that protection is in grave danger as pressure to support a Line 5 tunnel builds. Enbridge and their fossil fuel allies have mounted a massive Moving Michigan propaganda campaign. Touted as a safer alternative to the old Line 5, the tunnel plan is actually unsafe and disastrous for Michigan. It would keep Line 5 operating 20-25 years beyond its intended lifespan. There is nothing safe about drilling into bedrock for a tunnel next to an outdated and damaged pipeline that is still carrying oil through what University of Michigan experts have called the worst possible place for an oil spill in the Great Lakes. Enbridge acknowledges that the 66-year-old line needs to be replaced but plans to keep on using it while a new line in a tunnel is built, exposing the straits to a growing risk of a catastrophic oil spill. Enbridge’s willingness to risk our water for the bottom line is not surprising. What is surprising is that any lawmaker would support this foreign corporate venture when it holds so little benefit for Michigan. It is Enbridge that needs Line 5, not Michigan. They need it to reach eastern Canadian markets since the TransCanada pipeline was rejected for environmental reasons in their own country. Today 98% of Line 5's propane liquids and 90% of its oil go to Sarnia, Ontario, not Michigan. If we didn't allow our straits to be their shortcut, Enbridge could use its pipelines around the lakes to move oil to Sarnia. The risk to Michigan is not only unacceptable, it is completely unnecessary. Enbridge is willing to build and pay for a $500 million tunnel, not "to secure the energy needs of the state" as their Moving Michigan Campaign would have us believe. They are doing it to keep oil and profits flowing. If safety was a concern, they would not use an unsafe pipeline while building one that is ostensibly safer. Enbridge included many clauses which allow them to back out of the tunnel agreement. $500 million is an investment risk that pays off for them only if the price of oil is high 10 years from now – an unlikely prospect as the world responds to the climate crisis. If Enbridge chooses to opt out of the tunnel agreement, Michigan would be left with the tunnel debt, or worse, with the price of a disaster if Line 5 failed. It cost Enbridge $1.3 billion to clean up 25 miles of the Kalamazoo River when Line 6B failed, yet their liability is capped at $8 billion for 500 miles of Great Lakes shoreline. The Consumer Energy Alliance, made up of companies like ExxonMobil, BP, and Chevron, is the muscle and money behind the Moving Michigan campaign. Michigan chambers of commerce receive money from Enbridge. And Enbridge is sending resolutions to county boards of commissioners full of "whereas" statements supporting a tunnel. These national, state, and local campaigns are driving the advertising and the misinformation intended to convince Michigan of a non-existent need for a tunnel. Enbridge tells us the Upper Peninsula will face a cold winter without Line 5's propane, but alternate means of supplying this propane are available. Propane is already delivered by truck or rail in the UP today. Without Line 5, propane delivery would cost only a few cents more per gallon, as a Dynamic Risk Alternatives Report of 2017 has shown. Another option is to build a four-inch line from Superior, Wisconsin to Rapid River in the UP for the natural gas liquids (NGLs). Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's U.P. Energy Task Force is looking into these propane alternatives so that Michigan is prepared for a responsible decommissioning of Line 5, not a sudden failure. Only 2% of Line 5's NGLs are drawn off in Rapid River and converted to propane for the U.P. The rest goes to Canadian markets. Recently Michigan legislators have sought to enter Attorney General Nessel’s lawsuit in order to support the tunnel – a troubling development. If fossil fuel dark money prevails and an oil tunnel is built by and for Enbridge through Michigan waters, one thing is certain: old Line 5 must not operate in the interim. The audacity of the Enbridge tunnel campaign is hard to believe. The only thing harder to believe is that some Michigan legislators are buying it.

 An explosion of nearly unimaginable size and force obliterated much of Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia on December 6, 1917, killing 2,000 victims and wounding 9,000 others. It remained the largest man-made explosion in history until the U.S. dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. For days, the catastrophe pushed aside news from Europe of the bloody fighting in the trenches of World War I. Author Visits Traverse City Nov. 29Written in an engaging, cinematic style, the new book of bestselling Michigan author John U. Bacon, “The Great Halifax Explosion (Harper Collins),” injects new life into this all-but-forgotten event. Bacon will discuss the accident and its aftermath when he visits the National Writers Series at 7pm Thursday, Nov. 29.The AccidentAt first glance, “The Great Halifax Explosion” is a straightforward disaster tale. The outbound Norwegian freighter, Imo, was traveling too fast toward open waters. Inexplicably, the ship’s hard-charging captain, Haakon From, remained in the left “passing lane” in a narrow section of the harbor, bumping into an inbound French freighter, Mont-Blanc, captained byAimé Le Médec. The collision knocked loose some of the 400 barrels of airplane fuel lashed together on the Mont-Blanc’s forward main deck. A spark set the spilled fuel afire. That, in turn, ignited highly volatile munitions stored below in the Mont-Blanc’s holds. Busy Wartime PortBut there was more to the story. Halifax had become the main North American refueling stop and shipping point for men and “materiel”bound for the Great War (which only later would be called World War I). Not surprisingly, there had been accidents in the harbor before. But this accident was different. The Mont-Blanc carried a very special payload: six million pounds of high explosives. When the deck fire broke out, many Haligonians, as the residents of Halifax are called, huddled at the windows of their hillside homes to watch the action in the harbor below and track a dense plume of smoke as it rose two miles into the morning sky. They had no idea what was about to happen. Eighteen minutes later, they found out. Concentrated FuryThe Mont-Blanc’s deadly cargo exploded with immense, concentrated fury. The resulting shock wave traveled across the harbor and through the town at 3,400 miles per hour — more than four times the speed of sound. It turned the Mont-Blanc into a gigantic pipe bomb, created a powerful tsunami that tossed the 435-foot-long Imo a half-mile from the scene, flattened 6,000 of the city’s homes and businesses, and in an instant made 25,000 people homeless. The 90-mm gun mounted on the bow of the Mont-Blanc was found two miles away, twisted like a pretzel from the 9,000º heat (roughly six times the temperature of molten lava). The catastrophe killed an estimated 1,600 Haligonians outright. Another 400 victims later died from their injuries, often from oil, fuel, and small pieces of the Mont-Blanc that had rained down from the sky. Others were crushed when buildings collapsed, or they were burned to death when their homes caught fire. Many of the 9,000 injured were blinded or severely scarred by flying glass as they looked out their windows to watch the initial fire aboard the Mont-Blanc. In a two-week period, doctors in Halifax performed 25 amputations and 250 eye removals. A Many-Sided StoryBacon offers much more than just the numbers of victims and the pounds of TNT. His empathetic, detailed description of victims and heroes are some of the book’s most memorable passages. There are portrayals of Ian Orr and Noble Driscoll, boys whose innocent hobby involved watching and carefully recording the comings and goings of the ships down the hill from their homes. We learn about selfless acts. Many Haligonians wept openly, for example, when, without being asked for help, two trainloads of Boston doctors and nurses arrived on the scene to support local medical staff. Suddenly, there was hope. (Many of today’s Bostonians are probably unaware that their city’s gigantic Christmas tree is a gift each year from grateful Nova Scotians.) The experience changed many lives. Tending to survivors set wounded veteran Ernest Barss on the path to becoming a surgeon. (Interestingly, Barss later helped establish the hockey program while a student at the University of Michigan). A Cascade of Contributing FactorsOne of the most damning realizations is that the disaster could have been avoided. Bacon spoke to the Northern Expressof a “cascade” of factors big and small that, if handled differently, might have prevented the disaster. Most obvious is the simple fact that Captain From was pushing too hard to get the Imo out of the harbor and on its way New York City, where relief supplies for Belgium waited. After passing numerous other ships on the left, he stubbornly refused to steer back to the right side of the channel. Other causes of the explosion can be attributed to pressures created by the war. Halifax experienced an eightfold increase in ship traffic and became the busiest port in North America. That contributed to harbor congestion and frequent close calls. All of this played out against a grinding war in which an Allied victory was still far from assured. The sense of urgency was palpable. Americans, who had entered the war just six months earlier, were only starting to arrive in the trenches overseas and were badly needed. The war chewed up soldiers and munitions at an alarming rate. Consider the First Battle of Ypres, in Belgium, which resulted in 150,000 dead and wounded French and British soldiers (as well as those from British Dominion countries such as Canada, New Zealand, Australia and India). In return, the Allies’ only gain was 500 yards of strategically unimportant, bombed-out land. It’s logical to ask why an old, slow ship like the Mont-Blanc was selected for such a mission when a faster ship would have reached the harbor one or even two days earlier, thereby avoiding the collision. The answer is that the Mont-Blanc was available, and it still floated. (At that point in the war, German U-boats had already sunk 3,000 Allied ships.) In that context, overloading an old, slow, poorly maintained ship like the Mont-Blanc with 6 million pounds of high explosives can be seen as a desperate, wartime gambit, a way of possibly moving the needle in a war bogged down in a muddy, murderous stalemate. The Halifax Explosion put an end to that. It’s not hard to pick the downright dumbest factor contributing to the accident; it’s the story of the Halifax harbormaster. On Dec. 5, the evening before the collision, the Mont-Blanc was ready to enter Halifax’s protected waters. That couldn’t happen, though, because the harbormaster closed the anti-submarine nets earlier than usual so he could attend a party.If he had stayed at his post, the Mont-Blanc would have been safely anchored in Halifax harbor when the Imo passed the next day. TicketsNational Writers Series presentations take place at 7pm at City Opera House in Traverse City.

 MNA Staff Caption Close By JOHN FLESHER AP Environmental Writer TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — A federal judge has ordered a government agency to take a closer look at pipeline company Enbridge's plans for dealing with potential oil spills in the waterway connecting Lakes Huron and Michigan. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith instructed the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to provide more information about its reasons for approving the Canadian company's spill response strategies for areas including its Line 5, which carries oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. Goldsmith's ruling Friday was in response to a lawsuit by the National Wildlife Federation. The group contended the plans omitted key details about personnel, equipment and methods that would be used to contain and clean up oil that could be released from a rupture of a 4-mile-long (6.4-kilometer long) underwater segment of the pipeline that extends through the Straits of Mackinac. PHMSA responded that Enbridge had satisfied the requirements by contracting with oil spill removal organizations that the U.S. Coast Guard recognized as having necessary resources. Goldsmith acknowledged Enbridge had an extensively detailed "master service agreement" with the contractors. But the Detroit-based judge said PHMSA still "did not articulate a satisfactory explanation for its decision to approve the response plans." The wildlife federation also said the pipeline agency was legally required to prepare an environmental analysis and consider potential effects on endangered species but had failed to do so. Goldsmith ordered PHMSA to do both. "This ruling confirms what we've known for years — Enbridge is not prepared for an oil spill, and the federal government is not doing enough to protect the Great Lakes," Beth Wallace of the wildlife federation said Monday. The pipeline agency was reviewing the decision and had no immediate comment, spokesman Bobby Fraser said. "We have thoroughly reviewed the response plan in place for the straits on the off-chance that anything were to happen, although we've never had an incident in the straits in 65 years," Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said. PHMSA endorsed Enbridge's spill contingency plans for the pipeline network that includes Line 5 in 2015 and 2017. The latter plan covers the underwater section, which is divided into two pipes 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) in diameter. University studies have projected that a worst-case release of oil in the swirling straits could foul hundreds of miles of shoreline. Enbridge has said repeatedly the submerged pipes are in good condition and could last indefinitely. But the company, based in Calgary, Alberta, reached an agreement last year with former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to decommission that section of Line 5 in favor of a new pipe that would be routed through a tunnel drilled in bedrock beneath the straits. However, Michigan's recently elected attorney general, Dana Nessel, ruled last week that a law enacted in December to carry out the agreement violates the state constitution. Snyder's successor, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, then ordered state agencies not to issue permits or take other steps toward implementing the deal. Enbridge says it plans to discuss its next steps with Whitmer administration officials.

 Tribune News Services By KYLE KAMINSKI The Record-Eagle TRAVERSE CITY — A local roadway will remain partially closed following a recent tanker crash as crews work to clean up thousands of gallons of gasoline that spilled into a nearby field. Blair Township Fire Chief Bill Parker said the eastbound lane of Beitner Road from U.S. 31 to Williams Road is closed to traffic through Jan. 5. The westbound lane remains open but eastbound lanes will be detoured down Rennie School Road to Williams Road, he said. Michigan Department of Environmental Quality officials said about 5,700 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel spilled from a tanker truck following a crash on Christmas Eve. Portions of a nearby field will need to be excavated to remove contaminated soil, analyst Jarrett Hale previously said. Grand Traverse County sheriff's deputies said a 45-year-old Grawn woman — who they suspect could have been driving under the influence of marijuana — lost control of her SUV, crossed the centerline and collided head-on with the tanker truck. She broke several bones but her three passengers escaped with little to no injuries, deputies previously said. The tanker driver, a 42-year-old Alma man, was also uninjured in the crash. Three homes were also evacuated but families returned before Christmas Day.

url: https://www.manisteenews.com/editorials/article/GUEST-VIEW-Pipeline-spill-plans-should-be-public-14256528.php
 Tribune News Services The following editorial was published in the June 29 edition of the Petoskey News-Review: We appreciate the spirit behind the bills introduced by Reps. Tristan Cole and Lee Chatfield banning anchoring in the straits area to keep the pipelines running through there from dents, but are concerned with the secrecy they are including in their bills. Chatfield, R-Levering, Sue Allor, R-Wolverine, and Cole, R-Mancelona, introduced the four bills recently, which, in part, would codify an emergency rule from Governor Rick Snyder put in place last month officially barring anchors in the Straits. At that time, Chatfield released a statement saying that rule should be permanent. The decision was unpopular among environmental groups, who argued that the ruling did not address the real problem, which was the tandem underwater pipeline itself. Under the new rules, a first offense for illegally deploying, dragging or setting an anchor in the straits could result in imprisonment of up to two years, a $10,000 fine or both. On a second offense, the potential penalty bumps up to five years in prison and $15,000. But the problem with these plans comes in relation to the requirements that the owners of the pipelines file spill prevention and contingency plans with the Department of Environmental Quality every five years. Those plans would require that the companies document their plans for various-sized spills, describe their maintenance inspection process and provide records of past inspections, as well as describe all of their spill prevention technology. They would also require that they document their compliance with the Oil Pollution Act and Financial Responsibility Requirements and proper training procedures for employees at various levels. Both of those reports would require a $12,500 review fee, however, that review would mostly just be to insure that all of the requirements are included. The bill specifies that approval from the DEQ does not necessarily equate to a statement on the efficacy of the plans. If the DEQ denies the plan, the company would have 30 days to re-file. If not filed, the penalty would be $1,000 for every day that each of the plans are past due. Sounds good, so far, right? But, here is the rub, the plans are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. That means the public has no right to see these plans and no outside organizations or citizens can confirm these pipeline companies are complying with the law or what they are planning, leaving us to take the word of government bureaucrats in the state. These are the same sort of bureaucrats that brought you the Flint water crisis. We think these documents should be open to the public. It is of high public and economic safety that these plans are in the sunlight of public inspection. To hide something as important as this from the public is wrong.

 MNA Staff BEAR LAKE TWP. — Cleanup continues in response to an oil leak off Eight Mile Road in Bear Lake Township. According to the Department of Environmental Quality, Merit Energy Company reported the spill on Dec. 27. "The company noted their gas production falling off," said Bob Versical of DEQ Cadillac. "Lo and behold they found where some crude oil and brine had bubbled up to the surface in that wetland area." Versical said an estimated 50 barrels of oil leaked across a half acre of wetland, located between U.S. 31 and Chief Road. "They called us immediately and started to de-water in order to facilitate the excavation process," Versical said of the initial measures to remedy the spill. "They pumped out the water, contained it in tanks and then trucked the water off sight for appropriate disposal. "Now, they're running water through a carbon treatment system and discharging back into the wetland outside of the area of where the petroleum impact exists," he added. "Now they can effectively pump 24/7, with personnel on site. "It's an ongoing process, but now that they are effectively de-watering, I anticipate they may be in there for another week or so, remedying the surficial impacts." According to Versical, the next steps of the process will involve monitoring and restoring the affected area. "There's going to be some long term monitoring, absolutely," he said. "We just don't have enough information yet to decide on what needs to be done for a final remedy. "Ultimately, (Merit) is obligated to restore that wetland area to its original conditions," Versical added. "They're going to have to bring in organic fill material and reestablish the wetland vegetation to make sure it is consistent with the surrounding vegetation, and monitor to ensure no invasive species are introduced. "The wetland restoration is going to take some time," he said. "It could be a growing season or two, at least. Versical said while oil spills aren't necessarily uncommon, this pariticalar case was the region's largest in 2017. "In our Cadillac district (which covers six counties), we had 27 spills last year," he said. "Volumetrically, we're talking anything from a couple of gallons to one like this, which is nearly 50 barrels." Versical said the damage is contained to area in which the leak occurred, and no homes nor drinking water have been affected. Several attempts to contact Merit Energy for this story went unanswered.

 Dylan Savela Caption Close KALEVA — An informational hearing on the impact of the recent Merit oil spill in Manistee County will be held at 4:30 p.m. on Thursday at the Big Bear Sportsman’s Club in Kaleva (8927 Puustinen Road). The hearing will provide an opportunity for land and orchard owners to ask questions about the impact of the spill on their properties. All are invited to attend. Bob Versical, of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's (MDEQ) Cadillac post, will present general information on the spill and describe the ongoing and upcoming cleanup efforts. The hearing is being sponsored by the Bear Creek Watershed Council, in partnership with the Manistee Conservation District, Portage Lake Watershed Forever, Arcadia/Pierport Watershed and the Little Manistee River Watershed Conservation Council. "The Conservation District and people in watersheds groups were hearing rumors and getting questions (about the spill), but there was very limited information out there," said Jim Draze of the Bear Creek Watershed Alliance. "So, a small group of us met with the MDEQ, and Bob Versical gave us a presentation what happened and what will happen moving forward. "We asked if he'd be willing to make the same presentation to the local public," he added, "and we were able to set this up, so that people would have a chance to hear the information and ask questions if they have any." In late December of 2017, the MDEQ was alerted to a release of crude oil and brine from a transport line owned by Merit Energy. The result was approximately 2,000 gallons of oil and brine being released to a wetland area on the north side of 8 Mile Road, between Poplar and Chief Road in Bear Lake Township, and approximately one-quarter mile south of Little Beaver Creek. The initial release of oil affected approximately 0.5 acres. Merit Energy and the MDEQ responded by developing a cleanup plan. Since late December, contaminated soils have been removed from the site and Merit Energy has been pumping, filtering and returning filtered and clean water to the wetland. Water quality is being monitored by the MDEQ. Merit Energy will be responsible for restoring the wetland, under MDEQ supervision. “There’s going to be some long term monitoring, absolutely,” Versical told the News Advocate in January. “Ultimately, (Merit) is obligated to restore that wetland area to its original conditions. "They’re going to have to bring in organic fill material and reestablish the wetland vegetation to make sure it is consistent with the surrounding vegetation, and monitor to ensure no invasive species are introduced," he added. "The wetland restoration is going to take some time."

 Tribune News Services TRAVERSE CITY — A faulty weld may have caused a chemical spill that sent two workers at a Grawn manufacturing facility to the hospital. Grand Traverse Rural Fire Department Chief Theo Weber said the incident took place Friday morning at Materne North America's U.S. 31 facility, which produces GoGo Squeez applesauce products. He said the company's management already evacuated the building by the time firefighters arrived. The spill involved two chemicals used to clean stainless steel pipes. Weber said one chemical is put through the system and then flushed before a second chemical is pumped through. He said the procedure avoids mixing the chemicals, but it appears a recent flawed welding job created a leak that brought the chemicals together on the floor. "These two chemicals, you don’t want them to mix," he said. The subsequent reaction created fumes that sent two workers to Munson Medical Center for respiratory irritation. Weber called it a "non-life threatening" situation. Rural firefighters and a Traverse City Fire Department regional HAZMAT team entered the building wearing protective suits. Weber said they turned off valves, diluted the chemicals and ventilated the fumes from the building. Materne representatives couldn't be reached for comment.

 MNA Staff MANISTEE — A Sanitary Sewer Overfow (SSO) was reported by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Water Resources Division. A SSO is a reported discharge from a private or municipal separate sewer collection system (not a wastewater treatment plant) during wet or dry weather, or a dry weather discharge from a municipal combined sewer overflow system. According to the report, 500 gallons of raw sewage were discharged at 3-3:30 p.m. on June 20 after a 20 amp breaker used for the pump controls and alarm system failed, and no alarm was sent out to warn of a problem. The sewage backed up and overflowed at a manhole inside the River Haven Estates, located at 24 Caberfae Highway in Manistee. The manhole is about 500 yards from the lift station. A small amount of property on the manhole's south side where the overflow occurred and was cleaned up.

 MNA Staff TRAVERSE CITY — Officials think a boat leaked diesel fuel this week and caused a sheen to blossom across the water at the city's Duncan L. Clinch Marina. The sheen spread Tuesday and spread to about 60 feet long and 42 feet wide, an official at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality said today. Members of the U.S. Coast Guard responded to a call and investigated the incident. They furnished a report to the DEQ that said the spill was cleaned up before they arrived. Brian Jankowski, a district supervisor for the DEQ in Cadillac, said it was unclear how much diesel spilled into the bay. "You’ve got this rainbow sheen on the surface, but that can be very thin and an extremely small amount of material," Jankowski said. "Someone could spill half a cup and you could have a sheen five times that size." Check Saturday's Record-Eagle for more information.

 Tribune News Services By KEITH MATHENY Detroit Free Press (TNS) Imagine an oil slick quickly growing through the Straits of Mackinac from a rupture of the 62-year-old, twin pipelines known as Line 5 traversing the bottom of where Lakes Michigan and Huron connect. Now imagine oil spill response boats from the pipeline operator and U.S. Coast Guard moored at the docks, taking no action for hours, or even a day or more as the slick mixes and spreads in the often turbulent waves. That scenario is a real possibility if a Line 5 spill were to occur in bad weather, according to the U.S. Coast Guard and the pipeline owner’s contracted spill responder. Under high wave conditions, crucial offshore spill containment response might have to be put off for hours, or even days because of unsafe boating conditions, the responders say. That would delay the deployment of spill-containing boom, or the use of skimmers to remove oil from the water’s surface. And that would allow the ecological calamity to spread. “When you get above 3-, 4-, 5-foot seas — definitely at 5 feet — you are beyond where you can safely deploy these things and have them do any good,” said Jerry Popiel, incident management adviser for the Coast Guard’s 9th District, which includes the Great Lakes. And those conditions aren’t infrequent in the Straits of Mackinac. Weather records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory indicate that from 2010 through 2014, the straits area averaged wave heights of 3 to 4 feet about 24 days per year — as an entire day’s average. Waves exceeded 4 feet as an entire day’s average 8 days of the year. “The daily average one is especially important — that might mean the whole day is lost” for marine oil spill response, said Eric Anderson, a physical scientist with the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. The number of high-wave days expands dramatically if looking at when waves reached a 3- to 4-foot average for at least one hour of a day: That occurred, on average, 91 days per year between 2010 and 2014, according to NOAA data. Waves reached 4 feet or higher at least part of a day an average of 44 days per year. A new, weather-data-gathering buoy deployed in the Straits of Mackinac this fall by Enbridge, which owns and operates Line 5, in conjunction with Michigan Technological University showed that “significant wave height” — the average of the highest waves — exceeded 5 feet in all or a portion of eight days during October. And that was during a “relatively mild” weather month, said Guy Meadows, director of Michigan Tech’s Great Lakes Research Center. “November is typically the big month for really severe waves,” he said. The buoy was removed from the water for winter storage last month, he said. Charles Usher is president of Detroit-based Marine Pollution Control, a company contracted by Enbridge to respond in the event of an oil spill on the Great Lakes from the company’s pipelines. High seas could impede, if not halt, a response out on the lake with boats, he said. “If waves get up to enough that people are going to be bouncing around really dangerously, that’s a possibility, sure,” he said. “But that’s not unlike any other spill in any other part of the world. Weather’s always going to be a factor. In good conditions, it’s going to facilitate the cleanup. And in rough conditions, it’s going to hamper it.” It’s not a purely hypothetical possibility. Marine Pollution Control was called to respond to a 110-foot dredging barge that sank in Lake Huron about 6 miles north of the St. Clair River mouth near Port Huron in July 2012. There was concern regarding the potential for about 1,500 gallons of diesel fuel to leak from the barge. But Marine Pollution Control had to halt recovery activity because of weather conditions, Usher said. “Everything was fine when the seas were decent,” he said. “But when the winds started whipping up, and the seas started getting up to 2, 3 feet or more, it started getting rough. There was a couple of times there when we had to shut things down in consultation with the Coast Guard. And that was in the summer.” Usher said he also would not send his spill recovery boats out onto the Straits of Mackinac at night. “You cannot operate at night offshore,” he said. “It’s not too safe to be trying to conduct marine operations at night.” Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes responded to questions from the Free Press with an e-mailed statement. “It is important to point out that this pipeline has never had an issue during all of its years of operations,” he stated. “We would work closely with the U.S. Coast Guard and the entire Unified Command to ensure appropriate resources were being deployed safely and that response objectives were being met,” Barnes stated, adding the company would also work with NOAA to monitor and predict weather throughout any spill response. “Enbridge and its multiple oil spill response organizations maintain equipment to handle diverse weather conditions and would deploy the appropriate resources to respond to the event.” The average capacity of Line 5 is 540,000 barrels per day of light crude oil, light synthetic crude and natural gas liquids. A 2001 guide to marine oil spill response planning, prepared by the American Petroleum Institute, NOAA, the Coast Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, points out the crucial nature of the need to respond quickly to a marine oil spill. “During the first 24 to 48 hours of open water exposure, most oil spills become difficult to recover, burn, or chemically disperse,” a portion of the guide states. “Evaporation accelerates as oil spreads and thins, increasing its density, viscosity and tendency to emulsify; emulsification can produce oily fluids of greater volume and viscosity than the original spill; and decreasing slick thickness makes removing oil increasingly difficult.” Wave conditions not only make it difficult for boats to respond, but it can have a mixing effect on a floating substance, Anderson said. “Something that would normally form a scum or a slick will instead mix down into the water column,” he said. A 2014 study by David Schwab, a research scientist at the University of Michigan Water Center, in collaboration with the National Wildlife Federation, modeled how an oil spill from Line 5 would react in the Straits of Mackinac’s complex currents. The spill scenarios show that, depending on water current directions, a spill could be transported eastward into Lake Huron, westward into Lake Michigan and move back and forth through the Straits several times. Shoreline areas most impacted would be Mackinac Island, Bois Blanc Island and the Lake Huron shoreline east of Mackinaw City. Contamination could spread as far as Beaver Island in Lake Michigan to Rogers City in Lake Huron, the study found. “The currents up there move 1 to 2 miles per hour,” Schwab said. “I think it would be difficult to contain a spill in that area in the best conditions.” Gov. Rick Snyder in September created the Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board, following the recommendations of a task force on pipeline safety issued earlier this year. The board is reviewing the task force’s recommendations on Line 5’s future in the Straits of Mackinac that call for a third-party review of the pipelines that includes a risk analysis and look at possible alternatives, as well as a review of Enbridge’s financial assurances in the event of a spill. David Holtz, chairman of the nonprofit Sierra Club’s Michigan chapter, renewed his call to shut down Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. “It definitely reduces the meaningfulness of preparing for a rapid response to an oil spill when at least a quarter of the year, you’re not going to be able to go out in boats and actually contain the spill,” he said.

 Tribune News Services The following editorial appeared in the July 17 edition of the Detroit Free Press: (TNS) An oil pipeline running through the Straits of Mackinac should be shut down. On this point, most parties now agree — except, we presume, Enbridge Energy Partners, the Canadian company that owns and operates the pipeline. In this conflict, the cause has found a champion in state Attorney General Bill Schuette, who deserves praise for his efforts to shed light on this looming environmental disaster. Though the report details and solutions for Michigan’s aging oil pipeline network, it does not make clear how or when a shutdown might occur. The task force, led by Schuette and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Director Dan Wyant, released its findings this week. Among its suggestions: prohibiting Enbridge from moving heavy crude through the straits pipeline, requiring Enbridge to share public safety information about the pipeline’s condition, and calling for an independent analysis of the straits with suggested alternatives — presumably, the first step toward shutting down the pipeline. Statewide, the report called for better mapping of existing pipelines and improved safety response. After the report’s release, Schuette went further, declaring that the pipeline’s days were numbered. The report and its recommendations convey a sense of urgency. That Enbridge is the pipeline’s operator instills no one with confidence. That company was responsible for a devastating 2010 spill on the Kalamazoo River, the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history. An oil spill in the straits would be an environmental disaster that would permanently scar our lakes — not just an irreplaceable natural resource, but the source of drinking water for many Michiganders. But the report’s prescriptions lack the urgency its findings require. There’s no road map for achieving its recommendations, no clear explanation of which agencies must act. Schuette has made much of the recommendation to bar Enbridge from transporting heavy crude oil through the straits pipeline. But it doesn’t — only synthetic crude flows through the straits pipeline. Yet a spill of synthetic crude would also deal significant environmental damage, particularly during winter, when the lakes are topped with sheets of ice, notes David Holtz, chairman of the Sierra Club’s Michigan chapter. The Michigan Environmental Council notes that Gov. Rick Snyder, via executive order, can create a permanent pipeline advisory body. Requiring Enbridge to utilize an existing permit-application process — Gail Gruenwald, executive director of Tip of the Mitt Watershed Council told the MEC — would allow the state to set a time line for implementing the report’s recommendations, establish enforcement mechanisms and solicit public input. We urge Snyder and the Michigan Legislature to move quickly to implement these recommendations, and we devoutly hope Schuette continues to raise his voice in support — or else this report is nothing more than a dire warning of looming disaster. It’s impossible to understate the importance of protecting our Great Lakes. It’s a charge that transcends party lines. Or at least it should.

 MNA Staff Caption Close MANISTEE — Multiple emergency response agencies were dispatched to Manistee County Blacker Airport on Tuesday for a plane that failed to properly take off and crashed into trees. According to airport personnel, the small passenger airplane ran off the end of a runway at the airport, spilling fuel and prompting a clean-up response. Four people were onboard. The plane was transient and not stationed in Manistee, airport personnel said. The Manistee Township Fire Department, Manistee County Sheriff's Office and West Shore Medical Center responded. The crash remains under investigation.

 Tribune News Services Caption Close A National Wildlife Federation report released Monday criticizes Enbridge Energy’s plans to expand its pipeline capacity in Michigan and elsewhere in North America in light of the company’s more than 800 oil spills between 1999 and 2010. The release of the report comes two days ahead of the two-year anniversary of the spill in Marshall that dumped, depending on the estimate, more than 800,000 to more than 1 million gallons of tar sands oil into a creek that feeds into the Kalamazoo River. The more than $800-million cleanup is continuing, although most of the affected portions of the river were reopened to recreation this year. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has proposed a $3.7-million fine against Enbridge for its handling of the spill. “The Kalamazoo spill may have been a poster child for corporate negligence but it is far from the company’s only black mark. According to Enbridge’s own reports, between 1999 and 2010, they have been responsible for at least 800 spills that have released close to 7 million gallons of heavy crude oil into the environment — or approximately half the amount of oil that spilled from the Exxon Valdez in 1989,” according to the report, “Importing Disaster — The Anatomy of Enbridge’s Once and Future Spills.” Jeremy Symons, senior vice president for the National Wildlife Federation, noted that the company clearly did not respond well following the 54 spills totaling more than 1.2 million gallons it had in 1999 because of the large number of spills in each of the subsequent years in studied in the report. In 2010, the company had 91 spills totaling 1.4 million gallons, according to the report. “You can’t make the same mistake 800 times,” Symons said during a conference call with reporters, indicating that the company’s history shows how it will perform in the future.

 MNA Staff WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has proposed a record $3.7 million civil penalty and 24 enforcement actions against Enbridge Energy for the July 25, 2010 crude oil spill near Marshall, Mich. “We will hold pipeline operators accountable if they do not follow proper safety procedures to protect the environment and local communities,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. PHMSA’s investigation found multiple violations of its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations related to integrity maintenance, failure to follow operation and management procedures, and reporting and operator qualification requirements. PHMSA issued its notice and proposed civil penalty to Enbridge in a Notice of Probable Violation. Enbridge’s Line 6B ruptured on the evening of July 25, 2010, while the pipeline was in the process of a scheduled shutdown. Despite control center alarms, there were several attempts to restart the line, resulting in more pressure that expelled more oil. On July 26, a local natural gas company employee notified the Enbridge control center about the spill. By that time, more than 20,000 barrels of crude oil had been spilled.

Nick Assendelft, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), said the spill was dielectric fluid, which is used as a coolant, that leaked from a transformer. A St. Louis area resident had obtained the transformer in the hopes of scrapping the metal and while transferring the liquid inside to three 55-gallon drums, some of it leaked out and made its way to the river.

Wednesday afternoon, the spill had been determined not to contain PCBs, which is a good thing, Assendelft said, though the spill is still a concern for EGLE. PCB, polychlorinated biphenyls, are a group of man-made chemicals with no smell or taste used in industrial processes. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, PCB is known to cause a variety of adverse health effects and are known to cause cancer in animals. “The fact that there are no PCBs makes it a lot better situation at this point,” Assendelft said. He said the spill has been contained and there is no further leakage at this time. Crews continue to work on cleaning up the spill. Tuesday afternoon, the City of Midland was made aware of a liquid sheen on the water surface that was four to five miles long. Midland County 911 issued a warning to residents that is still in effect, to avoid Pine River near Woodcock and Prairie roads, extending the warning to the Tittabawasse and Chippewa Rivers as well. EGLE has been working with local officials in Midland and Gratiot counties to investigate and capture the liquid using vacuum equipment. A couple hundred gallons of water has been captured, which partially contains the liquid. However, crews are currently trying to determine details, such as how much of the fluid was in the transformer to begin with, to understand how much is still left to capture and clean up. “Some of this might have been captured on site just because it spilled onto the ground so that’s another thing we need to determine, is how much conceivably spilled onto the ground and is contained in the soil, and if we need to do soil remediation,” Assendelft said Wednesday. “And then how much of this spilled into the river? So, that is something that we’re trying to determine today – the capacity of the transformer, how much was captured and then essentially what is left and what happens to that.” Assendelft said it’s not unusual for transformers to be purchased for scraping, however, there are strict rules and regulations that must be followed to dispose of the liquid inside them. “There are some strict things you need to do in terms of containing the liquid inside and making sure that doesn’t leak and also making sure that that liquid does not contain PCBs,” he said. “So, if you essentially get one of these transformers through maybe a demolition job, and you are able to get the liquids out and there is no PCB, then you certainly can take that transformer then to the scrap yard and with documentation, and scrap it.” In addition, officials will work to determine how the spill happened, and the intent associated with it to figure out the next steps and whether there will be implications for the person responsible. Assendelft said in the meantime, residents should stay out of the water until the spill is taken care of and to allow crews working on the spill to do their job.

The release was reported Monday at Justin SWD 1 saltwater disposal well, about five miles (eight kilometers) southwest of Tioga. Bosque Disposal System, LLC reported Tuesday that 2,500 barrels of treated produced water was released due to a valve/piping connection leak. The product was contained on-site and at the time of reporting all of the spill had been recovered. A state inspector has been to the location and will monitor any additional cleanup required. The produced water was mixed with hydrochloric acid which was neutralized with sodium bicarbonate as part of the cleanup. Hydrochloric acid is a commonly used acid in oil and gas production.

Horseshoe Lake is a 97-acre lake located off Cedar Point Drive in southwest Belvidere Township. — Daily News/Elisabeth Waldon According to David Wierzbicki, incident management specialist with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Remediation and Redevelopment Division in Grand Rapids, the spill was reported by a resident on Jan. 4. Anywhere from 150 to 200 gallons of fuel oil leaked out of an oil tank in the yard of a cottage on Cedar Point Drive on Horseshoe Lake, which is a 97-acre body of water. “There is no immediate threat to human health,” Wierzbicki said. “The spill was well contained along the shoreline. The vast majority of the fuel was recovered. We’re going to assess from here what other risks might be present by sampling the drinking water wells in the spring.” Young’s Environmental Cleanup of Comstock Park responded to the scene last week and this week to excavate contaminated soil on behalf of an insurance company, while the DEQ oversaw the project. “They used a vacuum truck to vacuum up fuel along the shore and on the surface of the ice where the fuel had followed a drain tile down to the lake,” Wierzbicki said. “The ice essentially corralled most of the spill along a seawall next to the property.” Young’s Environmental Cleanup did not return calls seeking comment Friday.

A Monday morning traffic accident resulted in 900-plus gallons of driveway sealer and liquid tar spilling onto Vestaburg’s main intersection. According to Michigan State Police Trooper Cory Zimmerman, a pickup truck hauling a flat bed trailer was westbound on M-46 when a box truck turning east from Crystal Road failed to yield to the pickup truck. The at-fault driver was transported to Gratiot Medical Care for non-life threatening injuries. The non-fault driver was hauling a trailer load of three large pallets of driveway sealer/liquid tar. All three pallets fell from the trailer and landed on the roadway. The Michigan Department of Transportation was contacted regarding the material and it was determined not to be hazardous. “Given the 900-plus gallons that remained on the roadway, an industrial cleanup service was contacted to clean the spill,” Zimmerman said. “Due to such a large quantity spilled, the cleanup took several hours.” The Richland Township Fire Department assisted at the scene and traffic was kept between one and two lanes during the clean-up efforts. Alcohol and drugs are not suspected to be factors in the accident. You must be logged in to post a comment. Our Hometown

 Wednesday, March 4, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan Breaking News: BREAKING: Michigan State Police rule young girl’s death a homicide By Mike Taylor | on September 25, 2019 I still have nightmares about it; the time I nearly drove my motorcycle over a preschooler. It was a beautiful, autumn day. The sugar maples were blazing, the sun was a mellow, golden ball providing just enough warmth to allow for one last ride before packing my old Harley away for the winter. This was back in the days when the border between the USA and Canada was mostly hypothetical and I’d spent most of the afternoon tooling around Windsor. The wind had been high crossing back over the bridge to Detroit, but once I was again on city streets, the chill wasn’t bad at all. I rode aimlessly, putting along at 30 mph through residential neighborhoods. The neighborhood I wound up in was one filled with older, stately homes, wide lawns and tall, glorious maples, oaks and spruce. In nearly every yard, homeowners were busy with rakes and blowers, gathering fallen leaves and autumn debris, clearing away the last of summer and preparing for winter’s inevitable approach. The tree-lined streets were reduced by a fourth by the gold and red pyramids of leaves which had been raked to the curbs. I was young and the temptation was too strong to resist; I drove through the edges of the piles that edged out into the roadway. Even at their perimeter, some of the leaf piles were a couple of feet deep; the leaves rose in a shower around me as my motorcycle cut through them. The leaves made for less-than-secure footing for the bike, but as I said, I was only going 30 or so. Moped speeds. And it was fun. I clocked off the blocks, veering slightly to the right whenever a particularly welcoming leaf-stack presented itself. I no longer remember the name of the street I was on when it happened, but as I was riding through a long, large pile, I noticed – almost subconsciously – a small movement coming from some leaves directly ahead of me. On instinct, more than anything prompted by conscious volition, I swerved to the left, almost spilling the bike. As I passed, a small, blond head emerged from the leaves mere inches from my rear tire. When I regained control of the bike, I parked it and walked back the 20 or so paces to the child. He smiled as I approached. “Hi,” I said, pointing at the house he was sitting in front of. “Do you live here?” He did. I asked if his mother was home and he agreed she was. The kid and I walked up the curving drive and rang the bell. Turns out mom thought junior was napping. Somehow, the kid had snuck out of the house and had been playing in the leaves (in the road!) for who knows how long. I told her I’d almost run over her son and only missed him by inches. Some of the color left her face and junior got a scolding that would have terrified me had I been on the receiving end. This past weekend I related that story to a group of bikers who had stopped at a restaurant in Newaygo, one where my weekend bar band was playing. To a man, every rider there admitted he or she had at one time driven through piles of leaves while out riding. There’s just something about it that draws you in. Larry Stenson, who had driven down that day from Ludington, said he’d once spilled his Softail after hitting a bundle of small branches that had been hidden by leaves. Another rider had almost rolled over a little red wagon that had been obscured beneath a pile of oak leaves. My story, happily, ended without anyone (including myself) suffering an injury. But it could have gone differently. That Harley was a big bike, and that kid playing in the leaves was very small. As I said, I still get a weird feeling whenever I think of how it might have been. There are always the what-ifs. What if I hadn’t noticed that movement in the leaves? What if I’d been driving just 5 mph faster? What if I’d simply been less lucky? Is there a moral to this story? You bet. Don’t ride through leaf piles with either a motorcycle or automobile. And those of you holding the rake? Try to keep the piles up near the curb whenever possible. It’ll help young riders avoid the temptation. You must be logged in to post a comment. Our Hometown

Ionia Public Schools Board of Education Treasurer Karen Balice-Gregory, left, President Roger Hull, Superintendent Ron Wilson, Vice President Robin Marhofer and Trustee Jamie Meyer discuss a proposed Energy Conservation Improvement Bond to finance mechanical system upgrades at Ionia Middle School. — DN Photo | Karen Bota Director of Finance Adrienne Barna explained that architects for the upgrade, which would convert the steam boiler to hot water, estimated the cost at more than $3 million. A second project, remodeling the middle school bathrooms, was estimated at $400,000. “In looking at how we can finance this project so we can get that needed and necessary work done, $400,000 can come out of the current sinking fund revenue. We could seek an Energy Conservation Improvement Bond for the boiler,” Barna said. “With our current debt-to-SEV ratio, to issue non-voted bonds we need to fall under that energy conservation statute.” The final amount of the bond would be determined once bids for the project come in, she added, and would be only what is needed to cover the project. All but the bathroom renovations would be paid for by the bond. Barna told the board she would try to accelerate repayment “over the shortest amount of time possible” to reduce interest. The boilers were damaged by flooding after a pipe burst in February, submerging the units in five feet of water “and caustic chemicals and salt solution,” Superintendent Ron Wilson told the board. The offer from the district’s insurance company “did not restore us to the original condition … where we were before the incident … so we’re going to pursue replacing the damaged boilers with new high efficiency boilers.” The new boilers would provide 15 to 20 percent higher efficiency, he added. The project is likely to take two years because of its scope, which calls for changing out both the water and HVAC systems. Wilson said the insurance estimate was $320,000 to remove and replace the boilers, and $85,000 to refurbish the existing boilers. Calling herself “very much a risk-averse person,” Board Vice President Robin Marhofer said she “hate(s) that we borrow money to pay back the money we borrowed.” However in this case, she supports the move, because the interest costs will be offset by items such as energy savings. District Director of Facilities Mike Avery said the upgrades will provide healthier air for students to breathe. “In 2017 when we did our Energy Star audit, our CO2 level in the classroom was at the high end of the acceptable level,” he said. “This system will exchange more fresh air so that we actually provide a better quality environment for the kids.” Board trustees also approved awarding a bid for the Informacast Emergency Notification System to Presidio in the amount of $27,720. IPS Director of Technology Timothy Blackmer said that 75 percent of the cost will be paid by a 2018 Michigan State Police School Safety and Security Grant totaling $195,000. The remaining 25 percent match funds will be covered by Building and Site Sinking Fund revenues. Informacast allows messages to be sent in a variety of ways regarding emergencies, from armed intruders to chemical spills to severe weather warnings. An emergency notification system is part of each building’s emergency plan, Blackmer said. Informacast “ties right in with the purchase of protective window film, approved by trustees in February, and electronic access control, “in slowing the intruder down,” said Blackmer. The film will be installed over spring break, and the electronic access control “in the next couple of weeks where we can,” Blackmer said. “We try not to disrupt school.” Board trustees also learned that after graduation, the Ionia High School gym floor will have a face lift. A fire suppression line that froze, broke and flooded the sports common on Feb. 1 caused bowing of the maple floor in the gym. Luckily the damage was covered by insurance. “They were only going to do one-third of the floor, which would leave a zippered look,” Avery said. “We negotiated with the insurance company to go at least to half court.” The “silver lining,” according to Avery, is that he usually spends $9,000 to $10,000 a year to screen, sand and refinish the 19,000-square-foot floor. “We’ll pay our deductible and get a whole new gym floor,” he said. The gym will be under repair most of the summer. The quote by Floor Care Concepts in Wyoming for the work is $164,324.40. Wilson noted that the repair will not impact the general fund. “We normally go out for competitive bid, but because this is insurance work and we’re not using general fund dollars, and because of the lead time (to order the wood), I authorized the purchase,” he said. Policy allows the superintendent to authorize an emergency repair without prior approval by the board. You must be logged in to post a comment. Our Hometown

 Oct 26, 2019 PORTAGE, Ind. (AP) — The state environmental agency said a northwestern Indiana steel mill knew it was leaking dangerous chemicals into Lake Michigan but failed to report the spill or act quickly to mitigate the risks. The cyanide and ammonia spill in August at the ArcelorMittal plant in Burns Harbor closed beaches and killed nearly 3,000 fish. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management announced this week the steel mill didn’t report the Aug. 4 malfunction for days, by which time ammonia-nitrogen levels in the water had spiked. Then on Aug. 11, the facility experienced a problem with its blast furnace recycling system, which resulted in the release of cyanide and ammonia-nitrogen into the East Branch of the Little Calumet River. The company says it doesn’t fully agree with the conclusions but is working with regulatory authorities. LLANSING, Mich.

 Jul 11, 2019 ESCANABA — The Verso Escanaba Mill is replacing a sanitary sewer force main that ruptured last week, spilling water containing fecal matter into the Escanaba River. According to Verso, on Thursday, July 4, a water line leak was detected at the mill. Water was bubbling up through the road and was draining into a nearby storm sewer and into the Escanaba River. A visual examination of the leak and preliminary testing suggested the water was from a fire water line, which would have contained clean water. Monday, it was discovered a sanitary sewer force main is also buried in that area. As a precautionary measure, the mill installed a berm to completely divert the water flow away from the river and to the mill’s sanitary wastewater treatment plant. After the leaking water line was excavated later in the day Monday, it was confirmed to be the sanitary sewer force main. Water samples were collected and tested. The tests showed the samples were relatively low in total suspended solids. However, the samples collected tested positive for fecal coliforms. It is estimated approximately 12,000 gallons of water entered the river over the four day period before the leak was diverted. The leak was reported to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the Public Health Department was required. According to Verso, the excavated water line will be repaired as quickly as possible. LLANSING, Mich. (AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday invalidated Michigan's Medicaid work requirements, weeks ...

 Apr 2, 2019 FRESH NUTS, BOLTS and fittings are ready to be added to the east leg of the pipeline near St. Ignace, Mich., as Enbridge Inc., prepared in 2017 to test the east and west sides of the Line 5 pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac in Mackinaw City, Mich. A federal judge has ordered The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to take a closer look at pipeline company Enbridge’s plans for dealing with a potential oil spill in the waterway connecting Lakes Huron and Michigan. (Dale G Young/Detroit News via AP, File) TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — A federal judge has ordered a government agency to take a closer look at pipeline company Enbridge’s plans for dealing with potential oil spills in the waterway connecting Lakes Huron and Michigan. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith instructed the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to provide more information about its reasons for approving the Canadian company’s spill response strategies for areas including its Line 5, which carries oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. Goldsmith’s ruling Friday was in response to a lawsuit by the National Wildlife Federation. The group contended the plans omitted key details about personnel, equipment and methods that would be used to contain and clean up oil that could be released from a rupture of a 4-mile-long underwater segment of the pipeline that extends through the Straits of Mackinac. PHMSA responded that Enbridge had satisfied the requirements by contracting with oil spill removal organizations that the U.S. Coast Guard recognized as having necessary resources. Goldsmith acknowledged Enbridge had an extensively detailed “master service agreement” with the contractors. But the Detroit-based judge said PHMSA still “did not articulate a satisfactory explanation for its decision to approve the response plans.” THE MACKINAC BRIDGE that spans the Straits of Mackinac, as seen from Mackinaw City, Mich. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) The wildlife federation also said the pipeline agency was legally required to prepare an environmental analysis and consider potential effects on endangered species but had failed to do so. Goldsmith ordered PHMSA to do both. “This ruling confirms what we’ve known for years — Enbridge is not prepared for an oil spill, and the federal government is not doing enough to protect the Great Lakes,” Beth Wallace of the wildlife federation said Monday. The pipeline agency was reviewing the decision and had no immediate comment, spokesman Bobby Fraser said. “We have thoroughly reviewed the response plan in place for the straits on the off-chance that anything were to happen, although we’ve never had an incident in the straits in 65 years,” Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said. PHMSA endorsed Enbridge’s spill contingency plans for the pipeline network that includes Line 5 in 2015 and 2017. The latter plan covers the underwater section, which is divided into two pipes 20 inches in diameter. University studies have projected that a worst-case release of oil in the swirling straits could foul hundreds of miles of shoreline. Enbridge has said repeatedly the submerged pipes are in good condition and could last indefinitely. But the company, based in Calgary, Alberta, reached an agreement last year with former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to decommission that section of Line 5 in favor of a new pipe that would be routed through a tunnel drilled in bedrock beneath the straits. However, Michigan’s recently elected attorney general, Dana Nessel, ruled last week that a law enacted in December to carry out the agreement violates the state constitution. Snyder’s successor, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, then ordered state agencies not to issue permits or take other steps toward implementing the deal. Enbridge says it plans to discuss its next steps with Whitmer administration officials. LLANSING, Mich.

 Jan 24, 2020 RTI Surgical, in the River Park area in the city of Marquette, is pictured. (Journal file photo) MARQUETTE — RTI Surgical in Marquette reopened Wednesday evening, five days after employees were evacuated due to a nitric acid spill, Marquette Fire Department officials said. No injuries were reported as a result of the incident, and 19 individuals were transported to UP Health System-Marquette where they were evaluated, treated and released Marquette Fire Department Lieutenant Kurt Hillier said in a phone interview today. In an email Wednesday, RTI Surgical representative Andrea Johnson provided a statement from the company. “The safety of employees is a top priority for RTI. All employees who were in the building at the time of the incident were evaluated by medical personnel and are safe and well. Out of an abundance of caution and in line with our procedures, we closed the Marquette facility while we remediated the leak and performed air-quality testing,” the statement said. Emergency crews were on the scene for nearly eight hours according to a Saturday Marquette City Fire Department release. “We were there for quite a while because we had to wait for the right equipment and personnel to identify positively what we were dealing with,” Hillier said today. “In this case, because we didn’t know what we were dealing with, we had to call in the proper entities.” The cause of the incident, which according to the press release caused an orange plume in the area involved and a clear liquid visible on the floor, was a rupture in a 55-gallon drum of nitric acid, Hillier said. In order to gather that information, he said a hazardous material or haz-mat technician from the city fire department, a representative from Tri-Media Environmental and Engineering and an officer from Marquette County Rescue 131 “suited up” to enter the building. “Once we got eyes in the room we were able to determine the cause,” Hillier said. “We were also able to determine that there should be no environmental impact after the fact because there were no drains in the room where the barrel was stored.” Hillier noted that area agencies worked very well together to handle the situation. “We don’t get those haz-mat runs very often, so it was great to see all those agencies come together,” Hillier said. “It really went smoothly considering what it was.” He said once the cause of the issue was confirmed, the company became responsible for clean-up efforts and air quality assurances in the building. Nitric acid, Johnson said, is used in RTI’s cleaning processes, “as is common in industry process.” Marquette City Fire was assisted at the scene by the Chocolay Township Fire Department, Marquette County 131, Marquette Police Department, UPHS 141, Tri-Media Environmental and Engineering, Salvation Army, Marquette Township Fire Department EMS assisted the city with EMS coverage during the incident. Hillier said the Marquette Department of Public Works also assisted. RTI is identified on its website as “a leading global surgical implant company providing surgeons with safe biologic, metal and synthetic implants.” “RTI’s implants are used in sports medicine, general surgery, spine, orthopedic and trauma procedures and are distributed in nearly 50 countries,” the site states. “RTI has four manufacturing facilities throughout the U.S. and Europe.” Lisa Bowers can be reached at 906-228-2500, ext. 242.

 Dec 26, 2019 DETROIT (AP) — Initial water quality tests following the spill of limestone construction aggregate into the Detroit River did not turn up uranium, thorium, mercury or lead, according to an agency that supplies water services to Detroit and dozens of other communities in southeastern Michigan. Results of a first round of testing from the Nov. 26 collapse at Detroit Bulk Storage detected aluminum, barium, boron and strontium, but they occur naturally in the area’s raw water, the Great Lakes Water Authority said in a release. All levels detected for those metals were below the established regulatory guidelines for drinking water set by the U.S. Environmental Protect Agency and the state of Michigan, the agency added. Detroit Bulk Storage stores and provides material for road construction, according to its website. A dock at the site collapsed, discharging an unknown amount of crushed limestone into the river, along with asphalt and contaminated soils. The state Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has said testing determined that contaminant levels in the water were not detectable or well below quality standards. The site formerly was occupied by the Revere Copper and Brass Corp., which produced uranium materials in the 1940s and 1950s. That company was a subcontractor for the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II, according to U.S. Department of Energy documents. The water authority has two raw water intakes in the river. One is several miles upstream of the site. The second is several miles downstream, but on the Canadian side of the Detroit River and not in the direct flow stream of the river where the collapse occurred, the water authority said.

 Dec 7, 2019 DETROIT (AP) — Tests at a Michigan industrial site where limestone construction aggregate recently spilled into the Detroit River turned up no indication of excessive radiation levels, a state agency reported Friday. Staffers with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy inspected the Detroit Bulk Storage property with federal and local officials, taking radiological measurements and sampling river water just offshore in southwest Detroit, spokesman Nick Assendelft said. A drone provided aerial footage. “Today’s testing confirmed there is no elevated radiation risk to health or the environment associated with the collapse,” the state agency said in a statement. The company stores and provides material for road construction, according to its website. It did not respond to phone and email messages from The Associated Press. The release happened Nov. 26, although the state agency didn’t learn about it until Wednesday, Assendelft said. The company wasn’t required to report it because the aggregate is not a hazardous material, he said. The aggregate was piled along a seawall, part of which collapsed, he said. The cause is undetermined, although one possibility is erosion on the swollen river — part of the natural channel linking Lakes Huron and Erie, which with the other Great Lakes are experiencing the highest water levels in decades.

 Aug 17, 2019 PORTAGE, Ind. (AP) — An Indiana mayor accused state environmental officials Friday of waiting several days before notifying his city about a steel mill’s spill of cyanide and another chemical that led to a fish kill and prompted the closure of beaches along Lake Michigan. Portage Mayor John Cannon said the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and others learned Monday about an ArcelorMittal mill’s cyanide and ammonia-nitrogen spill, but didn’t inform his city until Thursday, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. “The Mayor is calling for action to be taken,” Cannon said in a statement. “Further, the City of Portage will be taking aggressive action with the EPA to ensure the breakdown of communication, like this, does not occur again.” IDEM and the U.S. Environment Agency’s Chicago office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Cannon’s comments left Friday by The Associated Press. The National Park Service said Thursday that in response to the chemical spill it has closed the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk beach areas at Indiana Dunes National Park as well as waters out to 300 feet. Portage is about 25 miles east of Chicago. The nearby city of Ogden Dunes also closed its beach and while that city’s drinking water was not affected, it has restricted water intake by its filtration plant as a precaution. News of the chemical spill followed reports of a large fish kill in the area of the Marquette Yacht Club and Sammie L. Maletta Public Marina, both in Portage. “There are dead fish everywhere. They’re up on shore, under the docks. I’m saying there are probably hundreds of fish,” Lake Station resident Janice McMullen told The Times when she arrived Wednesday at her boat in the Marquette Yacht Club. BRISTOL, Tenn.

 Aug 21, 2018 TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. — Federal officials said Monday they were prepared to act quickly if oil pipelines in a sensitive Michigan waterway leak, drawing a skeptical response from a U.S. senator who said the handling of a suspected anchor strike last spring exposed flaws in the system. Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, questioned the readiness of government agencies and the forthrightness of Enbridge Inc., owner of Line 5, which carries 23 million gallons of oil daily between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. A nearly 5-mile, dual segment of the pipeline runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac, where Lakes Huron and Michigan converge. Enbridge says the 65-year-old pipeline is in good condition, while environmentalists and some elected officials contend it poses a risk of causing a catastrophic Great Lakes spill and should be decommissioned. “It needs to go,” said Peters, a member of a Senate subcommittee that deals with pipeline safety policy. He grilled federal agency representatives during a crowded Traverse City hearing, saying the underwater portion of Line 5 “could have been a ticking time bomb” after it was struck by a suspected ship anchor April 1. “I don’t want to wait until the next disaster to consider what more we could have done to prevent it,” Peters said. Howard “Skip” Elliott, chief of Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, said the agency believes Line 5 is less likely to fail than another Enbridge line that spilled around 1 million gallons of oil in southern Michigan in 2010. The underwater portion of Line 5 has walls three times as thick as the pipe that ruptured and is operated at well below maximum pressure, he said. Underwater inspection revealed some “gouging” on the pipeline’s exterior after the anchor strike but not structural damage that would justify a shutdown order, Elliott said.­ DETROIT (AP) — An underwater commuter tunnel connecting downtown Detroit with Windsor, Ontario, Canada, is ...

 Jul 24, 2018 MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) — A hazardous material spill has forced the closure of a road in central Michigan. Dow Michigan Operations says the spill occurred about noon Monday from a delivery truck on Saginaw Road in Midland. WJRT-TV reports that the spill occurred as the truck was turning into a gate at the Dow Chemical plant and that the chemical is a form of acid which can be flammable. It was not immediately clear what caused the spill. Officials from the city of Midland and Dow Emergency Services were monitoring the situation. Dow Michigan Operations says the truck belongs to a third-party supplier. Dow says continuous air monitoring has shown there is no danger to the public. No evacuations have been ordered.

 Jul 19, 2018 DETROIT — Hundreds of miles of Great Lakes shoreline would be spoiled under a worst-case scenario oil spill in Michigan’s Straits of Mackinac, scientists reported Thursday. The cost of a doomsday spill could be as high as $1.8 billion, including $500 million in cleanup and $678 million in lost tourism revenue in Wisconsin and Michigan, experts said. A team of scientists from Michigan universities wrote a 400-page draft report on the risks of an extraordinary spill from Enbridge Line 5, a 20-inch twin oil pipeline that runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac, which connects lakes Michigan and Huron at the peak of the Lower Peninsula. A public hearing will be held on Aug. 13 in Harbor Springs. The impact of a spill would be significant, but the scientists cautioned that their analysis “extends to risks with low probabilities” of occurrence. Enbridge, a Canadian company, has been under scrutiny since 2010, when one of its pipelines ruptured in southern Michigan, releasing 800,000 gallons of oil into the Kalamazoo River system. Critics say Line 5, which has been transporting oil between Wisconsin and Ontario, Canada, for decades, should be shut down, saying it’s old and could be vulnerable to leaks. No large oil spill has ever occurred in the Great Lakes. Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration is expected to determine the pipeline’s long-term future by fall, just a few months before he leaves office. One option would be putting the pipeline in a tunnel under the lakebed. Enbridge insists that Line 5 is safe. The company said a 24-hour control center monitors the pipeline and can shut it down in minutes. “The scenarios presented in this report are purely hypothetical and the probability of the events actually occurring is extraordinarily unlikely because Enbridge operates our pipelines with multiple layers of safety in mind,” spokesman Ryan Duffy said. The report says a Line 5 rupture could release as much as 58,000 barrels — 2.4 million gallons — of oil and affect hundreds of miles of shoreline in Michigan, Wisconsin and Canada. Cleanup efforts could be affected by the wind, weather and season. It is “possible that shoreline cleanup operations for a potential spill in the Straits of Mackinac could continue for months to up to two years following the spill,” the report states. A 1953 easement makes Enbridge liable for damage or loss to public or private property, the scientists said. Line 5 carries light crude oil and natural gas liquids used to make propane. In 2016, more than half of Michigan’s propane needs were supplied by the pipeline. “Line 5 cannot remain in the Straits in its current form,” said Keith Creagh, director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. “This report highlights the need to continue developing a decommissioning strategy that protects the Great Lakes while at the same time maintaining the critical infrastructure between Michigan’s peninsulas that makes us one state.” Follow Ed White at https://twitter.com/edwhiteap WASHINGTON — U.S. businesses added 183,000 jobs last month, a solid gain that shows the economy was largely ...

 Apr 5, 2018 MACKINAW CITY — Local, state and federal agencies are actively monitoring and participating in the response to the dielectric oil spill in the Straits of Mackinac caused by a break in two underwater power lines that extend from the Upper Peninsula to lower Michigan, according to a press release issued Tuesday by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Dielectric fluid is part of the mineral oil family and functions as an electrical insulation and as a coolant. The U.S. Coast Guard received notification of the spill Monday evening from the American Transmission Co., a Wisconsin company that owns the lines. Initial reports from ATC indicate that around 600 gallons of product has been released into the water, a Wednesday press release from the U.S. Coast Guard states. In response, an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crew was deployed to conduct an overflight of the area, and response teams from Coast Guard Sector Sault Saint Marie were dispatched to investigate as well, according to the Coast Guard release. Currently, there is no pressure on the affected lines and the oil is leaking at a natural rate from the source, officials said. At this time residents should not notice any adverse effects from the de-energized lines. ATC has taken action to control the leak and there is no immediate public health threat. Samples of the product have been sent for laboratory analysis, officials said, and given the dilution of the product and mobility of fish, there is a low risk to fisheries and wildlife. The greatest threat is to waterfowl or shore birds that may come in contact with the product floating on the surface. Due to the inaccessibility of the shorelines from ice, there is a low-risk threat to the public since people are unlikely to come in contact with the oil, authorities said, adding that the oil dilution and distance from the bridge provide additional protection. “Our top priorities are to protect public health, the safety of both responders and communities in this region, and limit the environmental impacts as we contain and clean-up the spill as quickly and efficiently as possible,” said Coast Guard Capt. Marko Broz, the federal on-scene coordinator for the response, in a press release. “We are responding in cooperation with our federal, state, local and industry partners and have experience from actual spills on/in ice to draw from, as well as lessons from other areas around the country and around the world.” There are two water intakes in the general vicinity, but given the dilution of the oil and the distance of the intakes from the source of the discharge, there is no significant threat to drinking water at this time, Coast Guard officials said. Commercial vessel traffic has not been impacted either. ATC has six transmission lines that run parallel to each other under the straits. The company has activated its oil spill response plan. Such plans are approved and regulated by the federal Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The Coast Guard is the lead responding agency in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Department of Natural Resources, Michigan State Police Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division and Michigan Public Service Commission. Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline is not reported to be affected and is unrelated to this response, officials said.

 Mar 13, 2018 Around 180 gallons of gasoline was spilled around 4:30 p.m. on March 4 at the Krist Oil Co. gas station at 1110 Lincoln Ave. in Marquette, according to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency. Officials said the spill was caused because the overfill alarm for the station’s underground tank was not working, due to a manufacturer defect. Since the spill, the alarm has been replaced and repaired, with the station passing a compliance inspection on Monday, according to the EPA. (Journal file photo) MARQUETTE — Officials have released further information on clean up and repairs related to the March 4 gasoline spill that occurred at the Krist Oil Co. gas station along Lincoln Avenue in Marquette. The spill occurred around 4:30 p.m. when a tanker truck was delivering gasoline to an underground storage tank at the station and an overfill condition occurred. This led to gasoline spilling into the street and leaking into the storm drain system, according to information provided by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Though the EPA said the fuel loss was originally estimated at 400 to 700 gallons, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said about 180 gallons of fuel were lost in the spill. The station was able to determine the amount of fuel lost through its inventory control process. LARA officials said in an email that the spill occurred because the overfill alarm for the station’s tank was not working. The alarm was not operating due to ice found in the alarm box, which was a result of a manufacturer defect. Since the spill, the alarm box has been replaced, and all repairs were completed at the station on Friday, according to LARA. The station was re-inspected Monday for compliance with underground storage tank regulations and found to be in compliance. The initial response to the incident was provided by the Marquette City Fire Department and Department of Public Works and Utilities. Sand was hauled to the scene to absorb the gas that had pooled on the 1000 block of West College Avenue. The surrounding streets were closed and homes in the immediate area were evacuated for several hours. Streets had reopened on March 5, but crews worked through the week following the March 4 spill to clean and monitor the sewer system and its outlets, finishing the sewer cleanup on Thursday, said Jay Parent of the DEQ. The affected catch basins and manholes along the storm sewer route were cleaned out with a vacuum truck. The sewer line was also flushed and water removed from the system was taken away via truck, Parent said. According to the EPA, absorbent booms were also placed at the storm sewer’s outlet, near the outlet’s confluence with the Dead River. Since the spill, officials have been monitoring the Dead River for potential contamination. As of Monday, Parent said that contamination has not been detected; however, monitoring will continue. In addition to cleanup of the sewer, further cleanup has been performed in the immediate area of the spill, according to LARA. The concrete in the area where the spill occurred was removed by the owner, along with the soil beneath the concrete. The soil was then tested until it was clean, then the concrete was re-poured over the area. LARA officials said field instruments did not detect contamination in the soil or air in the surrounding area, with final lab results pending. Officials from Krist Oil Co. could not be reached for comment regarding the incident.

 Mar 5, 2018 The pumps at Krist Oil Co., located at 1110 Lincoln Ave., Marquette, are idle while employees await word to turn them back on following a gas leak at the station at about 4:25 p.m. Sunday. Emergency crews responded and cleaned up the spill, officials said. (Journal photo by Corey Kelly) MARQUETTE — A gasoline leak was reported at the Krist Oil Co. gas station located at 1110 Lincoln Ave., Marquette, around 4:25 p.m. Sunday. As the Marquette City Fire Department arrived at the scene, responders found a large amount of gas was covering the 1000 block of West College Avenue. The leak occurred when the station was being refueled by a fuel truck, when a large amount of gas began free-flowing out of the storage tank and on to the surrounding area, according to a press release from the fire department. Sand hauled to the scene by the city’s public works department was used to absorb the spill, as the gas was pooling in the street on the 1000 block of West College Avenue. Firefighters worked to secure the area by closing the 1000 block of West College Avenue, as well as other streets in the area surrounding the spill. They also evacuated buildings on the 1000 block of West College Avenue. “We just had some air quality concerns,” Lt. Jeff Haile of the fire department said. Haile said responders took ambient air readings and underground readings throughout the incident to monitor the air quality in the area. While they did not observe a specific high reading in the area, Haile said the area was evacuated because there was a potential for poor air quality related to the incident. The fire department notified residents around 8:30 p.m. Sunday, roughly four hours after the incident, that the air quality was no longer a concern and that it was safe to return to their homes at that time. No injuries were reported in relation to the gas leak. The cleanup of the gas leak was completed at 4:30 this morning, and the gas station store is now open, but the gas pumps remain off at this time. Marquette city police said all roads in the area are now open, as is Marquette Senior High School. Officials said the cause of the spill remains unknown and it is difficult at this time to estimate the actual volume of gasoline that was lost. The fire department was assisted on the scene by the city’s public works department, Marquette County Rescue Unit 131, as well as agents from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

 Jul 10, 2017 MARQUETTE — A fuel spill that occurred at 9:20 a.m. Saturday in Wells Township was cleaned up by Sunday morning, according to the Michigan State Police Negaunee Post. According to the release, the Department of Environmental Quality responded to the scene to evaluate and coordinate cleanup of the spill, which closed the westbound lane of County Road 426 for a short time. A fuel truck spilled about 100 of the 8,200 gallons of fuel it was carrying, as well as some of the diesel fuel from its fuel tank, the release said. The truck, from Stang WI Corp., was transporting fuel on County Road 426 and County Road SY to the Arnold gas station when the driver drove onto the soft shoulder causing the tanker to tip onto it’s side, the release said. The 59-year-old driver was not injured in the crash. Marquette County Road Commission responded to the scene to assist with any road damage or issues. Krist Oil Company assisted, draining the remaining fuel from the damaged vehicle into a second tanker. The Wells Township Fire Department responded to the scene with assistance from the Forsyth Township Fire Department and Marquette County Rescue Unit 131. The Michigan State Police Motor Carrier Officer and Trooper who responded to the scene were also assisted by Forsyth EMS and Crossroads Towing. Officials in the Marquette DEQ office could not be reached before press time. WASHINGTON — U.S. businesses added 183,000 jobs last month, a solid gain that shows the economy was largely ...

 Jan 11, 2020 DETROIT (AP) — Federal environmental officials found uranium, lead and several chemicals during testing of an industrial site where limestone construction aggregate material spilled into the Detroit River last year, a state agency said. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in a statement Thursday that the EPA’s testing of soil and water at the Detroit Bulk Storage detected “many heavy metals including uranium,” The Detroit News reported. Lead in just one soil sample surpassed EPA removal management levels, the state agency said. The department noted its previous testing there “showed no radiation above background levels at each of more than 1,000 locations on the site, nor in river water upstream and downstream.” The Great Lakes Water Authority conducted testing after the November collapse did not detect uranium in its downstream water intake, according to the release.

Alpena Firefighters use a boom to contain a small gasoline spill in the Thunder Bay River on Wednesday. The source of the spill is believed to be a catch basin nearby, where officials believe somebody illegally dumped gas. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy and the U.S. Coast Guard were notified of the spill and the Coast Guard will determine what steps, if any, will be needed to address the situation. ALPENA — A call from a concerned resident about a possible oil leak into the Thunder Bay River on Wednesday led to a hurried search for the cause of the discharge and cleanup of the contaminant. The chemical, which was found to be gasoline, was flowing out of a storm drain near the 9th Avenue dam. Officials believe it came from a catch basin in the parking lot of the Alpena Area Credit Union on Miller Street, where officials think someone illegally dumped gas into the catch basin, which flows to the river. The spill was reported to the national reporting center, Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, and the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard will determine next steps, if there is any other action required at all. The emergency call came into central dispatch around 9:30 a.m. and prompted a quick response of Alpena fire trucks and ambulances, as well as crews from the city Department of Public Works, Alpena utility management company Suez, and Alpena County Emergency Coordinator Mark Hall. Units searched feverishly upstream and downstream to find the plume, which was eventually located near the storm drain at the foot of the dam. After more searching, the source of the discharge was found. The fire department’s boat was launched and boom netting was installed to contain and absorb the oil. Alpena Fire Marshal and Deputy Chief Bob Adrian said the city gets call periodically about leaks and they are handled with the highest degree of response. “We take them all seriously and respond accordingly,” Adrian said. “If there is a spill or any other environmental threat, we do our best to contain it to protect the public and the environment.” Adrian said he believes the boom that is in place to contain and capture the gas could be the only remedy needed, because the spill was small. He said it is best, however, to let DEGLE and the Coast Guard investigate the seriousness of the matter and draw up plans from there. “It doesn’t take much to create a sheen on the water, and it only takes a little gas or oil to make it look like a large plume,” he said. “We will have follow-ups with the state and Coast Guard to see if more attention to it is needed, or if it is something the environment will take care of on its own.” ROGERS CITY — Rogers City officials on Tuesday said they would like to see a Huron Undercover Narcotics Team ...

 Apr 2, 2019 TRAVERSE CITY — A federal judge has ordered a government agency to take a closer look at pipeline company Enbridge’s plans for dealing with potential oil spills in the waterway connecting Lakes Huron and Michigan. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith instructed the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to provide more information about its reasons for approving the Canadian company’s spill response strategies for areas including its Line 5, which carries oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. Goldsmith’s ruling Friday was in response to a lawsuit by the National Wildlife Federation. The group contended the plans omitted key details about personnel, equipment and methods that would be used to contain and clean up oil that could be released from a rupture of a 4-mile-long (6.4-kilometer long) underwater segment of the pipeline that extends through the Straits of Mackinac. PHMSA responded that Enbridge had satisfied the requirements by contracting with oil spill removal organizations that the U.S. Coast Guard recognized as having necessary resources. Goldsmith acknowledged Enbridge had an extensively detailed “master service agreement” with the contractors. But the Detroit-based judge said PHMSA still “did not articulate a satisfactory explanation for its decision to approve the response plans.” The wildlife federation also said the pipeline agency was legally required to prepare an environmental analysis and consider potential effects on endangered species but had failed to do so. Goldsmith ordered PHMSA to do both. “This ruling confirms what we’ve known for years — Enbridge is not prepared for an oil spill, and the federal government is not doing enough to protect the Great Lakes,” Beth Wallace of the wildlife federation said Monday. The pipeline agency was reviewing the decision and had no immediate comment, spokesman Bobby Fraser said. “We have thoroughly reviewed the response plan in place for the straits on the off-chance that anything were to happen, although we’ve never had an incident in the straits in 65 years,” Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said. PHMSA endorsed Enbridge’s spill contingency plans for the pipeline network that includes Line 5 in 2015 and 2017. The latter plan covers the underwater section, which is divided into two pipes 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) in diameter. University studies have projected that a worst-case release of oil in the swirling straits could foul hundreds of miles of shoreline. Enbridge has said repeatedly the submerged pipes are in good condition and could last indefinitely. But the company, based in Calgary, Alberta, reached an agreement last year with former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to decommission that section of Line 5 in favor of a new pipe that would be routed through a tunnel drilled in bedrock beneath the straits. However, Michigan’s recently elected attorney general, Dana Nessel, ruled last week that a law enacted in December to carry out the agreement violates the state constitution. Snyder’s successor, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, then ordered state agencies not to issue permits or take other steps toward implementing the deal. Enbridge says it plans to discuss its next steps with Whitmer administration officials.

 Mar 30, 2019 ALPENA –A small mercury spill forced the closure of Alpena City Hall Friday, and it is currently unknown when the building will reopen. The spill happened while an employee was cleaning a storage room. Staff was sent home as a precaution. No one was hurt and there is no risk to the community, officials said. Assistant Building Official Mike Kieliszewski said he was cleaning and organizing a storage room and, while moving a gauge that measures liquid, it broke and discharged a small amount of mercury that splattered on the floor and at the base of a wall. He said that, although the spill was small, Fire Marshal Bob Adrian and officials from District Health Department No. 4 said the building should be closed until a contractor can bring a measuring device in and test the air and determine cleanup measures. The air handler, which circulates air throughout the building, was also shut down. Kieliszewski said he has been in contact with a pair of environmental cleanup companies, but, as of Friday afternoon, it was still unknown when the testing will be conducted or when City Hall will reopen. City Manager Greg Sundin said that, if the building cannot be reopened Monday, an alternate location for the Alpena Municipal Council meeting will be found and the information will be passed along to local media.

 Mar 22, 2019 ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — It was just after midnight on March 24, 1989, when an Exxon Shipping Co. tanker ran aground outside the town of Valdez, Alaska, spewing millions of gallons of thick, toxic crude oil into the pristine Prince William Sound. The world watched the aftermath unfold: scores of herring, sea otters and birds soaked in oil, and hundreds of miles of shoreline polluted. Commercial fishermen in the area saw their careers hit bottom. This month marks 30 years since the disaster, at the time the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Only the 2010 Deep Water Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has eclipsed it. The 986-foot Exxon Valdez tanker was bound for California when it struck Alaska’s Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. It spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil, which storms and currents smeared across 1,300 miles of shoreline. The oil also extensively fouled spawning habitat in Prince William Sound for herring and pink salmon, two of its most important commercial fish species. Fishermen and others affected by the spill dealt with ruined livelihoods, broken marriages and suicides. Exxon compensation checks, minus what fishermen earned on spill work, arrived too late for many. Most of the affected species have recovered, but the spill led to wide-scale changes in the oil industry. NASHVILLE, Tenn.

 Aug 22, 2018 TRAVERSE CITY — Federal officials said Monday they were prepared to act quickly if oil pipelines in a sensitive Michigan waterway leak, drawing a skeptical response from a U.S. senator who said the handling of a suspected anchor strike last spring exposed flaws in the system. Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, questioned the readiness of government agencies and the forthrightness of Enbridge Inc., owner of Line 5, which carries 23 million gallons of oil daily between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. A nearly 5-mile, dual segment of the pipeline runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac, where Lakes Huron and Michigan converge. Enbridge says the 65-year-old pipeline is in good condition, while environmentalists and some elected officials contend it poses a risk of causing a catastrophic Great Lakes spill and should be decommissioned. “It needs to go,” said Peters, a member of a Senate subcommittee that deals with pipeline safety policy. He grilled federal agency representatives during a crowded Traverse City hearing, saying the underwater portion of Line 5 “could have been a ticking time bomb” after it was struck by a suspected ship anchor April 1. “I don’t want to wait until the next disaster to consider what more we could have done to prevent it,” Peters said. Howard “Skip” Elliott, chief of Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, said the agency believes Line 5 is less likely to fail than another Enbridge line that spilled around 1 million gallons of oil in southern Michigan in 2010. The underwater portion of Line 5 has walls three times as thick as the pipe that ruptured and is operated at well below maximum pressure, he said. Underwater inspection revealed some “gouging” on the pipeline’s exterior after the anchor strike but not structural damage that would justify a shutdown order, Elliott said. He acknowledged it took several days for his agency to dispatch personnel to the straits area. But he said the agency and the U.S. Coast Guard had participated in drills there in recent years “to ensure seamless emergency response coordination.” Peters said it was “completely unacceptable” that Enbridge waited more than two weeks to send a remotely operated vehicle to inspect the pipelines, and Elliott said he “would like to have seen something more swift.” David Bryson, Enbridge’s senior vice president for liquid pipeline operations, said the Canadian company takes “extra precautions” with the underwater section of Line 5, describing it as “the most inspected segment of pipe in our entire North American network.” PONTIAC (AP) — A Detroit lawyer who said he knew Aretha Franklin and “idolized her” was appointed as interim ...

 Aug 21, 2018 TRAVERSE CITY (AP) — The federal government’s top pipeline regulator says his agency is keeping tabs on dual lines in a crucial Michigan waterway but believes they have a low risk of failure. Howard “Skip” Elliott of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration testified Monday in a Traverse City hearing convened by Michigan Sen. Gary Peters. The hearing focused on a segment of Enbridge Inc.’s Line 5 that carries oil across the Straits of Mackinac, where Lakes Huron and Michigan meet. Elliott said the dual pipelines in the straits have walls three times thicker than another Enbridge line that ruptured in 2010 in southern Michigan, leaking around 1 million gallons. He also said dents caused by an April anchor strike don’t appear to present a threat. Peters described the anchor strike as a “nightmare scenario” that could have caused a catastrophic spill.

 Jul 20, 2018 DETROIT — Hundreds of miles of Great Lakes shoreline would be spoiled under a worst-case scenario oil spill in Michigan’s Straits of Mackinac, scientists reported Thursday. The cost of a doomsday spill could be as high as $1.8 billion, including $500 million in cleanup and $678 million in lost tourism revenue in Wisconsin and Michigan, experts said. A team of scientists from Michigan universities wrote a 400-page draft report on the risks of an extraordinary spill from Enbridge Line 5, a 20-inch twin oil pipeline that runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac, which connects lakes Michigan and Huron at the peak of the Lower Peninsula. A public hearing will be held on Aug. 13 in Harbor Springs. The impact of a spill would be significant, but the scientists cautioned that their analysis “extends to risks with low probabilities” of occurrence. Enbridge, a Canadian company, has been under scrutiny since 2010, when one of its pipelines ruptured in southern Michigan, releasing 800,000 gallons of oil into the Kalamazoo River system. Critics say Line 5, which has been transporting oil between Wisconsin and Ontario, Canada, for decades, should be shut down, saying it’s old and could be vulnerable to leaks. No large oil spill has ever occurred in the Great Lakes. Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration is expected to determine the pipeline’s long-term future by fall, just a few months before he leaves office. One option would be putting the pipeline in a tunnel under the lakebed. Enbridge insists that Line 5 is safe. The company said a 24-hour control center monitors the pipeline and can shut it down in minutes. “The scenarios presented in this report are purely hypothetical and the probability of the events actually occurring is extraordinarily unlikely because Enbridge operates our pipelines with multiple layers of safety in mind,” spokesman Ryan Duffy said. The report says a Line 5 rupture could release as much as 58,000 barrels — 2.4 million gallons — of oil and affect hundreds of miles of shoreline in Michigan, Wisconsin and Canada. Cleanup efforts could be affected by the wind, weather and season. It is “possible that shoreline cleanup operations for a potential spill in the Straits of Mackinac could continue for months to up to two years following the spill,” the report states. A 1953 easement makes Enbridge liable for damage or loss to public or private property, the scientists said. Line 5 carries light crude oil and natural gas liquids used to make propane. In 2016, more than half of Michigan’s propane needs were supplied by the pipeline. “Line 5 cannot remain in the Straits in its current form,” said Keith Creagh, director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. “This report highlights the need to continue developing a decommissioning strategy that protects the Great Lakes while at the same time maintaining the critical infrastructure between Michigan’s peninsulas that makes us one state.” PONTIAC (AP) — A Detroit lawyer who said he knew Aretha Franklin and “idolized her” was appointed as interim ...

 Apr 7, 2018 BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The developer of the Dakota Access oil pipeline that goes under a reservoir in the Dakotas has submitted a court-ordered spill response plan, but an American Indian tribe that draws water from Lake Oahe is unsatisfied with the company’s efforts and is taking steps of its own to protect its water supply. The Standing Rock Sioux also worries that cultural sites could be harmed by oil spill response efforts or by the staging of equipment at the Missouri River reservoir. Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners submitted its 270-page spill response plan for Lake Oahe on Monday, along with a review by an independent engineering company that concludes the pipeline complies with federal regulations. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ordered Energy Transfer Partners last December to produce a plan, six months after ordering the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to further review the impact on tribal interests of the $3.8 billion pipeline that moves North Dakota oil to Illinois. That work is ongoing. The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, which are leading a four-tribe lawsuit against the pipeline, say the Corps and ETP have not given them a meaningful role in the process. The tribes contend they weren’t allowed to provide adequate input in the spill response plan or in the selection of the independent engineering company. NASHVILLE, Tenn.

 Dec 5, 2017 BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — The Army Corps of Engineers and the developer of the Dakota Access pipeline must complete an oil spill response plan for the stretch of pipe beneath the Missouri River in North Dakota, a federal judge ruled Monday. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg’s order grants a request by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes for additional measures to protect the river’s Lake Oahe reservoir. The tribes draw drinking water from the lake and also consider it sacred. Completion of a response plan and additional pipeline monitoring are warranted while the Corps determines the pipeline’s impact on the tribes, the judge said in his ruling. He cited in part the spill of 210,000 gallons (800,000 liters) of oil from the Keystone Pipeline in South Dakota last month. He ordered the environmental impact study in June. “Although the court is not suggesting that a similar leak is imminent at Lake Oahe, the fact remains that there is an inherent risk with any pipeline,” Boasberg said. Standing Rock Chairman Mike Faith applauded the judge’s decision, saying the pipeline “remains a clear and present danger.” Cheyenne River attorney Nicole Ducheneaux said the ruling acknowledges that the government and energy companies can’t be allowed to make decisions “without including stakeholders and the tribes to whom the United States owes a trust duty.” The $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline began moving North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution point in Illinois in June. Texas-based developer Energy Transfer Partners maintains the pipeline is safe, and the company and the Corps had argued that tribal requests for additional protections at Lake Oahe were unnecessary or unwarranted. Boasberg disagreed and ordered ETP and the Corps to work with the tribes on completing a spill response plan by April 1. He also ordered the company to work with the tribes to select an independent engineering company to review whether the project complies with federal laws and regulations. ETP must file bimonthly reports on the status of the pipeline. “Each of the interim conditions is tailored to address the court’s ongoing concern with the risk of a spill at Lake Oahe,” said Boasberg, who added that the risk was “at the center” of his earlier decision to require more environmental study. ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado said in a statement that the pipeline “has been safely operating since early this summer” and declined further comment, citing an ongoing tribal lawsuit over the pipeline. Corps spokesman Mark Abueg said the agency was reviewing Boasberg’s order. Grow America’s Infrastructure Now, a pro-pipeline coalition of businesses, trade associations and labor groups, called Boasberg’s ruling “reasonable” but also “largely unnecessary.” Coalition spokesman Craig Stevens said Dakota Access “is among the safest pipelines ever constructed, including extra-thick walled pipe under the lake.” NASHVILLE, Tenn.

 Nov 16, 2017 PORTAGE, Ind. (AP) — Environmentalists are questioning why the public wasn’t notified about an October chemical spill into a Lake Michigan tributary that U.S. Steel asked Indiana regulators to keep confidential. Documents released by the University of Chicago’s Abrams Environmental Law Clinic show that U.S. Steel’s plant in Portage, Indiana, released 56.7 pounds (25.7 kilograms) of chromium on Oct. 25 after a wastewater treatment system malfunction. That’s nearly double what the plant is permitted to release of the potentially cancer-causing chemical over 24 hours. A company official wrote to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management on Oct. 31 asking that its submission about the release “be afforded confidential treatment under all applicable statutes.” Law students at the University of Chicago obtained the letter while tracking pollution violations at U.S. Steel and other factories along Lake Michigan as they prepare a planned lawsuit accusing the Pittsburgh-based company of repeatedly violating the federal Clean Water Act since 2011. The same plant released nearly 300 pounds (135 kilograms) of hexavalent chromium in April because of a pipe failure, prompting closure of nearby Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore beaches and a drinking water intake for some communities in the area about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Chicago. Officials said that spill was almost 600 times the plant’s release limit. U.S. Steel said in a statement Tuesday it promptly communicated with the Indiana environmental agency on Oct. 27 about the second spill “and continues to work to ensure that there is no environmental impact.” The company declined to comment about the potential lawsuit. Unlike the April spill, U.S. Steel didn’t report the latest incident to the National Response Center, a warning system overseen by the U.S. Coast Guard to alert local authorities about oil spills and chemical releases, records show. The October spill wasn’t serious enough to merit reporting “and did not pose any danger to water supply or human health,” U.S. Steel said. Company spokeswoman Meghan Cox said Wednesday that its confidentiality request was made “due to business sensitive material” and has since been waived. NASHVILLE, Tenn.

 Sep 19, 2017 PASADENA, Texas (AP) — The U.S. government received reports of three spills at one of Houston’s dirtiest Superfund toxic waste sites in the days after the drenching rains from Hurricane Harvey finally stopped. Aerial photos reviewed by The Associated Press show dark-colored water surrounding the site as the floods receded, flowing through Vince Bayou and into the city’s ship channel. The reported spills, which have been not publicly detailed, occurred at U.S. Oil Recovery, a former petroleum industry waste processing plant contaminated with a dangerous brew of cancer-causing chemicals. On Aug. 29, the day Harvey’s rains stopped, a county pollution control team sent photos to the Environmental Protection Agency of three large concrete tanks flooded with water. That led PRP Group, the company overseeing the ongoing cleanup, to call a federal emergency hotline to report a spill affecting nearby Vince Bayou. Over the next several days, the company reported two more spills of potentially contaminated storm water from U.S. Oil Recovery, according to reports and call logs obtained by the AP from the U.S. Coast Guard, which operates the National Response Center hotline. The EPA requires that spills of oil or hazardous substances in quantities that may be harmful to public health or the environment be immediately reported to the 24-hour hotline when public waterways are threatened. The EPA has not publicly acknowledged the three spills that PRP Group reported to the Coast Guard. The agency said an on-scene coordinator was at the site last Wednesday and found no evidence that material had washed off the site. The EPA says it is still assessing the scene. The AP reported in the days after Harvey that at least seven Superfund sites in and around Houston were underwater during the record-shattering storm. Journalists surveyed the sites by boat, vehicle and on foot. U.S. Oil Recovery was not one of the sites visited by AP. EPA said at the time that its personnel had been unable to reach the sites, though they surveyed the locations using aerial photos. Following AP’s report, EPA has been highlighting its response to the flooding at Superfund sites. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt reiterated that safeguarding the intensely-polluted sites is among his top priorities during a visit Friday to the San Jacinto River Waste Pits, one of the sites AP reported on about two weeks ago. Pruitt then boarded a Coast Guard aircraft for an aerial tour of other nearby Superfund sites flooded by Harvey, including U.S. Oil Recovery. NASHVILLE, Tenn.

 Sep 15, 2017 By SCOTT BAUER Associated Press Less than 20 percent of a 461,000-gallon (1.7-million-liter) gasoline spill in Texas during Hurricane Harvey was recovered by the company responsible, while the rest evaporated or soaked into the ground, a U.S. Coast Guard official said Thursday. Only a minor amount of the spill appeared to have escaped the Magellan Midstream Partners storage tank farm in the Houston suburb of Galena Park, said Coast Guard Lt. Commander Jarod Toczko. It’s the largest spill reported to date from the storm that made landfall in Texas last month. The Oklahoma-based company reported recovering about 2,000 barrels, or 84,000 gallons (320,000 liters), of gasoline in the days after the Aug. 31 spill, Toczko said. It’s unknown how much of the fuel evaporated and how much seeped into the ground. “We know how much spilled, but it’s difficult to say the exact amount evaporated,” he said. Gasoline is more volatile than oil, meaning it evaporates more quickly after it’s spilled. It’s also more likely to catch fire and can more rapidly penetrate the soil and potentially contaminate groundwater. Magellan spokesman Bruce Heine says a cleanup of contaminated soil at the company’s facility should be completed within a few weeks. He estimated that less than five gallons (19 liters) of fuel reached a small waterway adjacent to the company’s property that drains into the Houston Ship Channel. The rest was contained onsite. “Although we do not have an estimate of the total volume of soil that we will remove and replace at this time, the project will comply with all laws and regulations,” Heine said. State officials were not aware of any health concerns from the spill, according to Texas Commission of Environmental Quality spokeswoman Andrea Morrow. Environmentalists have criticized the official response to the accident, including not notifying the public more quickly about the scale of the spill. Magellan reported the total volume to federal officials on Sept 5. A day later, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency official told The AP that the spill was a “2,500-gallon fuel oil spill at the Houston Magellan facility.” The volume was not publicly reported until Sept. 11, in a story by The Associated Press. The EPA said in a statement this week it “provided “the best information it had at the time” when it used the lower figure. The Associated Press has identified more than 30 above ground fuel and chemical storage tanks that failed during the storm and released more than 600,000 gallons (2.2 million liters) combined of crude oil, gasoline and other chemicals. Two storage tanks failed in the Magellan case. Initial indications suggested the massive tanks floated off their foundations as floodwaters swamped the company’s tank farm, Toczko said. That’s what happened at tank farms in Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina, when numerous storage tank failures spilled millions of gallons of fuel into floodwaters. Magellan has said only that the spill was “related to flooding associated with the hurricane.” Heine said Thursday that the cause remained under investigation. NASHVILLE, Tenn.

 Aug 9, 2017 Utah is asking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for $1.9 billion in damages after the EPA inadvertently triggered a multi-state spill from an old gold mine in Colorado, the Utah Attorney General’s Office confirmed Tuesday. The state filed the claim in February but never publicly announced it, said Dan Burton, a spokesman for the attorney general. Word of the claim first surfaced Friday when the EPA made a passing reference to it in a news release. It is by far the largest known claim stemming from the August 2015 spill from the inactive Gold King Mine in southwestern Colorado, and it brings the total to at least $2.3 billion. The Navajo Nation filed a claim for $162 million and the state of New Mexico sought $130 million. Burton initially declined to say what Utah’s claim included or how state officials arrived at the $1.9 billion figure but said details would be released later. “It’s a function of looking at the damages, and the cost of cleanup and the long-term maintenance in the area,” he said. Asked why the state had not made the claim public earlier, he said, “I think our general policy has been to solve the problem and take care of it” rather than create a media stir. An EPA-led contractor crew was doing exploratory excavation at the mine in preparation for a possible cleanup when workers accidentally breached a pile of debris that was holding back water inside the mine. About 3 million gallons of wastewater spewed from the mine, sending a mustard-color plume of pollution into waterways in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. Indian lands were also affected. Farmers and utilities suspended water diversions, and rivers were temporarily closed to rafters during the busy tourist season. The EPA said water quality quickly returned to pre-spill levels. Compensation for damages has been a contentious issue. At least 144 government agencies, businesses and individuals filed claims for lost wages and income, crop damage and other losses. The EPA accepted responsibility for the spill but said in January that federal law prevented it from paying any damage claims. That brought down vehement criticism from members of Congress and local officials. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who took over the agency after the election of President Donald Trump, promised to reconsider the decision. On Friday, Pruitt said the EPA would review at least some of the claims. But the EPA said the law prevented it from reconsidering claims from anyone who had filed a lawsuit against the federal government. That ruled out a review of claims filed by New Mexico and the Navajo Nation, which have sued. Utah also filed suit, but it named mine owners and EPA contractors as defendants, not the government. New Mexico Environment Secretary Butch Tongate said Tuesday he was optimistic his state’s lawsuit would be successful. The EPA did not respond to emails asking how it would pay for any damage claims it accepted or any court judgments it was ordered to pay. The White House has proposed slashing EPA’s budget by 31 percent, to $5.7 billion. NASHVILLE, Tenn.

 Aug 5, 2017 SILVERTON, Colo. (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency will reconsider whether to pay farmers, business owners and others in three states for economic losses caused by a mine waste spill that government crews accidentally triggered in 2015, the agency’s leader said Friday during a visit to the site. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who toured Gold King Mine with Colorado lawmakers on the eve of the disaster’s second anniversary, said he told people to resubmit claims rejected under the Obama administration. It’s not clear if the agency could pay on its own or how much of the potential payouts would need to be approved by Congress. The spill sent 3 million gallons (11.3 million liters) of tainted wastewater from the old gold mine into rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, causing an estimated $420 million in economic damages. The EPA has designated the area a Superfund site to pay for a broad cleanup. Stretches of waterways turned an eerie orange-yellow, and the rivers were temporarily off-limits for agriculture and water utilities, as well as fishing and boating — important contributors to the area’s recreational economy. The EPA has said water quality has returned to the conditions before the spill. Native American reservations along the rivers also were affected. Pruitt, who had promised to visit the mine during his confirmation hearing earlier this year, said he has sent letters to people whose claims were rejected by former President Barack Obama’s EPA. In January, the agency said federal law prevented it from paying claims because of sovereign immunity, which prohibits most lawsuits against the government. The “EPA should be held to the same standard as those we regulate,” he said in a statement. “The previous administration failed those who counted on them to protect the environment.” It’s uncertain whether the White House and Congress, both controlled by Republicans, are willing to pay for any of the economic losses, although the GOP has been most vocal in demanding the EPA make good.
