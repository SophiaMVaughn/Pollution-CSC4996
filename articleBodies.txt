 The Midland Daily News This column will be a little different than the usual approach that I take. I read an interesting commentary about an interview taken from Medcape Family Medicine, July 14, 2016, with Robert D. Brook, MD, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Michigan and Director of the Hypertension Center there. Dr. Brook is from Michigan and does research on the effects of air pollution. He said he was sitting on the beach in the late 1990s with his brother who is an atmospheric scientist. Dr. Brook thought the haze he saw on the horizon, while looking over Lake Michigan, was “sea haze.” His brother explained to him, however, that it was pollution causing the foggy atmosphere. It piqued Dr. Brook’s interest and so began his lifelong research into the effects of pollution on healthcare. As with most of us, Dr. Brook thought the major problem with air pollution was that it caused lung problems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other issues like these. Research has shown, however, that the majority of health effects from air pollution are adverse cardiovascular events. This includes heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and sudden death. Air pollution is the ninth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Air pollution in defined in terms of fine PM. A PM 2.5 means particles that are less than 2.5 µm in diameter. They result from fossil fuel combustion (coal, gas, etc.), mobile sources such as traffic, or the energy industry in the modern world. The PM for a particular size is then measured in weight/m3. In the United States, the average PM 2.5 is about 10 µg/m3. In comparison, PM levels in a smoky bar are about 500 µg/m3. A little bit confusing but just compare the numbers while reading below. For the last few years, the United States has gone down from levels of 25 to 30 µg/m3 in the 1970s and 1980s to an average level of 10 µg/m3 now. This dramatic reduction has translated into an improvement in all-cause mortality leading to a six- to seven-month increase in life expectancy on average in the United States. (I thought that was pretty impressive!) However, close to 25 percent of Americans are still exposed to levels above the World Health Organization standards of 10µg/m3. Many such areas are next to roadways or in urban industrial locations. People in Asia, particularly China and India, are exposed to far higher levels of pollution than we now are. These are also the areas where cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are escalating dramatically. It is interesting to note that second-hand smoke levels are around 500 µg/m3. One cigarette delivers well over 5000 to 10,000 µg/m3. One cigarette is comparable to a month’s worth of exposure to air pollution in Beijing, China! So how does air pollution trigger the cardiovascular/heart problems? Extensive research has shown different ways. Pollutants injure the lining of the blood vessels, they cause the blood vessels to constrict and narrow, and the platelets in the blood which are involved in clotting become more sensitized and clot more easily. This all leads to more clots in the vessels (strokes and heart attacks) and arrhythmias in the heart (sudden death). (I’m simplifying this significantly!) Then the next question is: How do the pollutants do these things? For those of you who have read this column regularly, you have learned that it appears that inflammation is the first step in the cascade of events that cause strokes, heart attacks, cancer and dementia. Reduce inflammation and you reduce all of these major killers. It turns out that when the lung inhales pollution particles, the lung tissue becomes inflamed. The inflammation isn’t just isolated to the lungs, but rather inflammatory chemicals throughout the body are increased. Subsequently, the inflammation causes vascular and cardiovascular tissue to be inflamed, causing constricting of the vessels, as well as the clotting and buildup of atheroscleratic plaques. Interesting! Inflammation is the culprit once again. Many of us have heard about inflammation around the gums (gingivitis) causing heart disease. It’s part of the same story. Gingivitis causes significant inflammation which generalizes throughout the body. It is the chemicals that cause inflammation that lead to the major problems of strokes, heart attacks, cancer, and dementia. A second way that air pollution leads to heart problems is that the lung can sense these foreign particles and promote rapid changes in the body’s chemistry. It’s sort of the “flight or fight” response. Our body surges with various hormonal chemicals when it feels “attacked” and that leads to an increase in blood pressure, constriction of blood vessels, and heart arrhythmias. The final way that the pollution affects the heart and blood vessels is that the very chemicals causing the pollution are toxic in themselves. Those chemicals are absorbed through the lungs and have a direct effect on various body tissues. There are thousands of very fine particles of organic chemicals and metals in pollution. Cigarette smoke is a convenient way to deliver nicotine into the body, but the air we breathe delivers many of those other chemicals also. If scientists can detect these bodily responses to short term exposures to pollutants, imagine what happens over the long term. Think of the adverse effects on the body’s systems. We must remember that pollution is not the only factor causing heart and lung problems. Diet, obesity and exercise all play a role. But when you add on pollution, the effects multiply. One final thing in the interview was discussion of the mask that you see many Asians wearing when they are in the major cities. Do they filter out pollution? Mostly the masks being worn are simple surgical masks that protect people from respiratory droplets. They aren’t made to protect us from the fine particles in air. China and the rest of Asia are often exposed to PM levels between 100 to 500 µg/m3 (10 to 50 times what the average level is in the United States). There is some evidence showing that home air filters or purifications systems with HEPA filters do reduce exposures and lead to improved health. Research is ongoing. So, as I noted, this is a little different approach to my usual column, but rather interesting stuff, isn’t it? Dr. John L. Pfenninger’s column appears on Sundays. His office, Medical Procedures Center, is located in Midland.

 By EMERY P. DALESIO RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina judge said Friday he wants to review a surprise deal settling decades of groundwater pollution at Duke Energy's coal ash pits because he questioned the motives behind the company's deal with state environmental regulators. The deal reduced the $25 million fine at a Wilmington power plant that state regulators had promoted as the largest penalty for environmental damage in state history. The agreement cut the fine to $7 million but also sought to resolve groundwater pollution claims at all 14 of the company's power plants storing toxic coal ash, not just one. The judge who signed off on the settlement last fall went too far with his order that seemed to close lawsuits involving conservation groups, Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway said. "It is a bit surprising that in a penalty case over one plant, it developed into as comprehensive a settlement as this," Ridgeway said. The Department of Environmental Quality could decide the appropriate fine for Duke Energy polluting the groundwater at its Sutton power plant, Ridgeway said. But because Administrative Law Judge Phil Berger Jr. wasn't asked to rewrite the scope of his order approving the deal, Ridgeway said he suspected the settlement's language was designed to close the courtroom door to environmental groups or others. "I have to suspect that there is some ulterior motive," he said. The parties later agreed to ask Berger to revise his order, Duke Energy spokeswoman Erin Culbert said. Berger is the son of state Senate leader Phil Berger. The Republican's district includes Eden, site of a 2014 spill of toxic coal ash that prompted a new law requiring Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash holding pits by 2029. State water quality officials knew for years about the contamination at Sutton's unlined ash pits but took no enforcement action until August 2013 — after a citizens groups tried to sue Duke Energy. Monitoring wells near Duke's dumps at Sutton showed readings exceeding state groundwater standards for chemicals including boron and thallium, which was used in rat poison until it was banned because it is highly toxic. The hearing came on the day DEQ signed off for the first time on plans to drain the water off the top of basins where coal ash is collected, a needed step to closing, excavating or covering them. The state permit for work at Duke Energy's Riverbend power plant in Mount Holly is intended to be a model for documents needed to close coal ash pits around the state. It allows water to be diverted to rivers and streams until 3 feet of water remains above the ash. Duke Energy will be required to test fish near the discharge site to see whether their bodies contain collected mercury or lead, and twice a year test the waterway for those heavy metals and arsenic, chromium and cadmium. ___ Follow Emery P.

 The Associated Press FREEPORT, Texas (AP) — Before Houston and its suburbs were built, a dense forest naturally purified the air along a stretch of the Texas Gulf Coast that grew thick with pecan, ash, live oak and hackberry trees. It was the kind of pristine woodland that was mostly wiped out by settlers in their rush to clear land and build communities. Now one of the nation’s largest chemical companies and one of its oldest conservation groups have forged an unlikely partnership that seeks to recreate some of that forest to curb pollution. The plan drafted by The Dow Chemical Co. and the Nature Conservancy is only in its infancy and faces many hurdles. But it envisions a day when expensive machines used to capture industrial pollutants might be at least partially replaced by restoring some of the groves of native trees that once filled the land. “It looks very promising at the early stage of the research,” said Mark Weick, director of sustainability programs for Dow. “But for this to become something that is an emission control, everyone needs to know it works.” Many plants, and especially trees, capture pollution naturally when it hits their leaves. Trees with the biggest leaves and the widest canopies capture the most pollutants, especially nitrogen oxide, a common byproduct of combustion that can irritate lungs and contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone. The reforestation proposal imagines emissions from Dow’s largest North American factory drifting downwind into the trees near Freeport, Texas. Dow and the Nature Conservancy began a six-year, $10 million collaboration in 2011, when they came together to look at ways natural resources could be used to save the company money. After reading an obscure notation by the federal Environmental Protection Agency that suggested reforestation could improve air quality, the two groups decided to research how the idea might work and whether it could be cost-effective. Scientists used a complex model from the U.S. Forest Service that considers everything from wind patterns to the size of tree leaves and the overall canopy to estimate the air-quality improvements that might come from 1,000 acres of forest. “The big discovery was that you could combine the traditional infrastructure with reforestation and still meet regulation,” said Laura Huffman, the conservancy’s director in Texas. The trees, Huffman said, may not completely replace traditional technology, but they could complement it, allowing factories to use smaller, cheaper equipment. The research found that over 30 years a 1,000-acre forest would remove 4 to 7 tons of nitrogen oxide annually, said Timm Kroeger, a senior environmental economist with the conservancy. A traditional mechanical “scrubber” removes about 50 to 70 tons annually. So a 10,000-acre forest equals one average industrial scrubber, he explained. And in this part of Texas, where open land is ample, reforestation is within reach. The cost of the project not including the land would be about the same as using traditional forms of pollution control, Weick said. Organizers hope to work with a landowner interested in reforesting, probably with help from conservation tax credits. Or the Nature Conservancy or the federal government would buy the land and give it to Dow free of charge. A recent progress report determined that the cost of cleaning a ton of nitrogen oxide through reforestation was $2,400 to $4,000, compared with $2,500 to $5,000 using traditional equipment. The research is still being reviewed by other scientists. And before any formal plan could be adopted, it would have to win approval from state and federal regulators, who would require any pollution-cleansing method to be quantifiable and enforceable. Trees may not fit the bill. Unlike machines, they are living organisms that are subject to diseases, droughts and other threats such as hurricanes or fires. Back in 2005, another scientific group researched a similar idea and decided it would not pay off. “The conclusion that we reached was that what they were trying to do was difficult and that the degree of uncertainty was larger than the benefits,” said Mark Estes, a senior air quality scientist with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Even if it wins broad support, the plan won’t be approved anytime soon. In Texas, it can take up to four years to change clean-air rules. And that’s before any proposal moves up to the EPA. As he looked out over land ripe for reforestation, Jeff Wiegel, the conservancy’s director of strategic initiatives in Texas, was realistic about the pace of progress. “It’s a long road toward that,” he said.

 The Dow Chemical Co. will pay to clean up six areas of contaminated sediment in the Tittabawassee River as part of a new agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The pollution is in the three-mile stretch of the river that is adjacent to Dow’s Michigan Operations site. It is the first segment in what the EPA expects to be a series of upstream-to-downstream cleanup projects. Unlike high levels of dioxin found in other areas of the river, this segment contains arsenic, chlorobenzenes, chlorophenols and more that were released by Dow. In three of the six areas, cleanup also will take place for dense non-aqueous phase liquid, or DNAPL, which the EPA said is a heavy liquid made up of materials that do not mix with water and sink to the bottom of the river. The planned work and previously released cost estimates are as follows: • Area 1: Place a clean cap over contaminated sediment to isolate and stabilize the sediment. Cost: $250,000. • Areas 2 and 3: Remove and treat DNAPL, isolate contaminated sediment with sheet pile and a cap and capture water within the sediment and treat it. Cost: $1.8 million. • Areas 4 and 5: Place a clean cap over contaminated sediment to prevent erosion. Cost: $600,000. • Area 6: Dredge and dispose of sediment contaminated by ethyl parathion; remove and treat DNAPL; isolate remaining contaminated sediment with sheet pile and a cap; and capture water within the sediment and treat it. Cost: $3.1 million. “Materials will be treated and disposed at approved locations, sites will be monitored during and after the cleanup and the cleanup systems will operate and be maintained,” the EPA stated in an e-mail announcing the new agreement. Mary Logan, EPA remedial project manager, previously said the cleanup would prevent chemicals on the surface from harming small invertebrates or contaminating areas downstream if the sediment was disturbed. Dow spokeswoman Mary Draves said the company remains focused on moving toward a resolution. “Now that the plan for segment 1 has been finalized we will begin to conduct work as outlined in the agreement,” Draves said in an e-mail. “This, along with other work we have conducted, is part of our continued work with both the EPA and MDEQ towards progress on implementation of our agreement.” Visit www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/dowchemical for more information about the Superfund site.

 Tony Lascariof the Daily News Replacing contaminated soil, cleaning homes and paving roads in Saginaw's Riverside Boulevard neighborhood are all meant to prevent residents from being exposed to dioxins and furans. But, it's possible the work will need to be repeated in the future because the Tittabawassee River regularly floods the area containing 11 homes. The Dow Chemical Co. and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed to cleanup work in July, and officials involved recognize there are limitations. "It's going to reflood; it's going to recontaminate to some extent," said Al Taylor, a Michigan Department of Environmental Quality geologist. It is unclear how fast, and at what level, contamination will return, Taylor said. He said previous cleanup sites have varied from having little to "significant" recontamination following flooding. A monitoring system needs to be developed to make sure contamination levels do not rise to current levels, Taylor said. He said action would have to be taken if levels rise to where they become a problem again. With work taking place to remove contamination upriver of the neighborhood, officials hope recontamination can be prevented. Dow's 1,900-acre chemical manufacturing plant in Midland was a source of dioxins and furans, which are byproducts from the manufacture of chlorine-based products. Dow spokesman John Musser has said the contamination found in the Saginaw neighborhood is thought to have been the result of releases from pre-World War I operations. Jeff Kimble, on scene coordinator with EPA Region 5, said the houses are unique because they regularly flood, as opposed to other houses along the river that generally are built above the floodplain. Detailed sampling of the neighborhood was triggered by one initial sample that contained 5,900 parts per trillion of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds. The testing found more than 10,000 parts per trillion in surface soils in the neighborhood. Kimble said samples taken indoors indicate the contaminants are being tracked indoors. In the yards, two feet of soil will be removed from the riverbank to Riverside Boulevard and replaced with fresh soil and vegetation. The dirt road, which creates dust in dry periods, will be paved. "Dow has been steadfastly working out there," Kimble said, with a goal of finishing by Oct. 15. Four other areas of concern that have a higher priority for the EPA also are being examined to determine contamination levels in residential soil. Kimble said those properties do not have houses as close to the floodplain, like the Riverside Drive neighborhood does.

 JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer France, stung by oil tanker disasters that soiled its seas and beaches, is moving to protect one its most precious maritime resources _ the Mediterranean _ with stiff new punishments for polluters. The measures, adopted last week by the French parliament in a rare show of unanimity, will create an environmental protection zone off southern France's Mediterranean coast, whose sun-drenched waters and beaches draw hordes of tourists every year. World Wildlife Fund oceanographer Denis Ody welcomed the effort but said France must strengthen policing in the Mediterranean to make it effective. "This law is a good idea but will work only if accompanied by the financial and human means to have it taken seriously," he said Monday from the southern port city of Marseille. The measures, which President Jacques Chirac is expected to sign soon, are directed at shippers deliberately dumping oil, garbage and other pollutants in the Mediterranean. It seeks to punish them even when they are outside French territorial waters. Under the law, France will create an ecological protection zone extending up to 90 miles from its Mediterranean coast. France says it does not need the approval of neighboring countries to implement the new measures, though other Mediterranean nations it has contacted generally welcomed the idea. The Mediterranean is a major world shipping route linking the Atlantic Ocean with the Suez Canal. About a quarter of global oil traffic goes through the Mediterranean, according to French government figures. In 1999, the sinking of a 25-year-old tanker called the Erika spilled 3 million gallons of oil that washed up on France's Atlantic beaches. Another oil spill last year off northwestern Spain added urgency to French and European efforts to tighten maritime safety laws. The Prestige disgorged millions of gallons of oil when it broke up and sank in November, polluting Spanish and French coasts and shutting down fisheries. But French authorities say the washing out of ballast, oil and fuel tanks, the dumping of garbage at sea and similar practices cause more pollution than shipping accidents. "It's this deliberate pollution that is the main target" of the new measures, said Tokia Saifi, France's secretary of state for sustainable development, when she presented the proposals to lawmakers Thursday. Ships flush their tanks at sea because it is cheaper and quicker than doing so in port, and because few ports have tank-washing facilities, Ody said. Studies suggest 225 million gallons of oil and fuel are flushed into the Mediterranean each year this way, he said. "It's a chronic problem," Ody said. Captains of ships caught washing out oil tanks in the zone risk fines of up to $600,000. Their vessels could be seized until the fine is paid, French government officials said. Captains of French ships caught polluting the zone also risk up to four years in prison. The government expects the law to take effect before the summer, when sun-loving tourists descend on Mediterranean beaches en masse.

 DAVE BRYAN Associated Press Writer David Baker remembers the upheaval in his hometown of Anniston in the 1990s when many residents realized their health and property had been contaminated by toxic PCBs from a nearby chemical plant. The experience spurred Baker and others in predominantly poor, black west Anniston to form Community Against Pollution to fight for damages and clean up the contamination. Today, most of the group's members have been involved in lawsuits against the chemical company. "It was just something you could not believe in these days and times to see the people who suffered behind this," Baker recalled. Like Baker, citizens in many poor, black communities around Alabama and the South in recent years have fought companies who have located pollution-spewing industrial plants, hazardous landfills and waste incinerators near homes and schools. Known as "environmental racism," the practice of locating such toxic operations near politically powerless blacks has been stymied by the emerging citizen groups. "Companies now don't just bully in," said Robert Bullard, sociology professor at Clark Atlanta University. "When they do, they're in for a rude awakening. There is no path of least resistance any more." Bullard, author of "Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class and Environmental Quality," said many members of watchdog groups are involved in lawsuits seeking massive damage judgments. Over time, as low-income neighborhoods in Southern towns became more racially mixed, poor people, white and black, joined in the fight, Bullard said. They often run up against business and civic leaders working to develop communities economically. To the developers, such projects often bring in badly needed jobs and revenues for areas that sometimes have little of either. Larry Lee, a spokesman for a company that reopened a landfill in east Alabama last year, said many supported the project, which brought about 35 jobs to a rural community in Tallapoosa County. But in 2000, a company that planned to build Alabama's biggest solid waste landfill withdrew its proposal after the Rev. Jesse Jackson joined residents to oppose the dump in predominantly black and poor Macon County. The landfill would have covered 700 to 800 acres near the town of Shorter and accepted up to 5,000 tons of trash a day from around the South. But Milton McGregor, a white who is a dog track magnate and property owner, withdrew the application after meeting with Jackson and other leaders, and a day before the county commission was to vote on it. Bullard said environmental racism has its roots in the segregationist era in the South when racially segregated schools were legal and building paved roads or parks in black communities was optional. As the New South began to take shape following World War II, politicians in many Southern towns wanted to create jobs and bring in tax revenues to grow local economies. "In many cases (the South) would accept things that other regions would say no to," Bullard said. "Race was a major player in determining where these facilities went in and how they were operated." Many companies moved projects such as waste incinerators and petrochemical plants out of the crowded Northeast. Typical was Sumter County in Alabama, where the nation's largest hazardous waste landfill was built at Emelle in 1978. The 3,200-acre waste treatment, storage and disposal facility came to the predominantly black county during a period when few blacks held public office there. The disposal site, run by Waste Management Inc., created jobs in the area, but it received some of the most hazardous wastes from Superfund sites in the United States and from foreign countries. It handled nearly 800,000 tons of hazardous waste at its peak in 1989 until state officials began to see its negative impact. The state imposed higher taxes on waste shipments and fewer PCB-contaminated materials were sent as tonnage dropped. In the early 1990s an awareness of environmental racism arose among community activists and academics, said Bullard. He said Louisiana in particular became a "hotbed" of environmental racism lawsuits, with many communities along the Mississippi River serving as sites for incinerators and petrochemical plants. In the mid-1990s, the Japanese company, Shintech Inc., wanted to build a $700 million plastics plant in St. James Parish. But parish residents got help from student attorneys at Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. Shintech eventually scaled down the plan to $250 million, and moved it to Plaquemine. In rural Lowndes County, one of the poorest in the country, efforts to build a 230-acre solid waste landfill near the historic Selma-to-Montgomery National Historic Trail are on hold because of community outrage. County commissioners approved the project on land owned by Waste Management Inc. But Lowndes County Citizens United for Action sued to halt construction, contending in part it was wrong to put a waste disposal site near the highways where marchers helped inspire the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The case is making its way through the courts. The mainly black county residents had support from the mainly white residents of Lowndesboro. "Twelve jobs _ come on," said Barbara Evans, who heads the community group. "Twelve jobs for a dump on the … historic civil rights trial." Evans said with roughly 250 types of landfills in the state, including 29 that take in more than 32,000 tons of waste daily, Alabama doesn't need new landfills to handle its trash. "I think Alabama is being targeted and I think especially the communities of color and low-income neighborhoods are being targeted," she said.

 Ralph E. Wirtz of the Daily News If you are a little younger, you still would have seen some of the tanks and the smokestacks, but the wording on the side would have changed. You would have seen "Total" emblazoned across the white metal. Today, you can still see some of the tanks and some of the smokestacks, even though the plant closed two years ago. But they are going fast, as are the remnants of what used to be a thriving industry in this Gratiot County city. Including, the residents hope, the pollution. The pollution is what you wouldn't have seen had you been driving through Alma - the oil slowly seeping toward the groundwater through the earth, or the sludge that accumulated on the bottom of Horse Creek, a tributary of the Pine River used for outflow from the Total refinery waste ponds. Some people noticed, although few outside Chicago, Lansing or the immediate area. For the past eight years, investigations have revealed large amounts of pollution in the ground, water and air surrounding the plant site. The investigations have resulted in a $4 million fine and a $9 million cleanup project for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock - the latest owner of the property. The stories of the cleanups along the river between Alma and St. Louis are intertwined, much like the histories of the two cities. They both grew in fits and starts, counting logging and agriculture as the first wave of industry, heavy manufacturing in the early 1900s as the second and growth of two distinct industries as the third. The chemical industry in St. Louis began in 1935, when the Michigan Chemical Co. began taking brine from the ground near the area's mineral springs, turning it into bromides and salt. Crystal Flow salt was a hot item in area grocery stores. As Michigan Chemical grew, it began producing methyl, ethyl bromides, magnesia, DDT, antihistamines and analgesics, and the waste from these processes went right into the river. People then didn't know what they do now about controlling pollution and there were few laws and regulations to force them to comply. In the middle of the century, if a reactor overflowed, it was allowed to just spill onto the ground, according to Jack Bails, who was chief of the Environmental Law Enforcement Division of the Department of Natural Resources beginning in 1976. "If people had a liquid they wanted to get rid of, they would just take it to the back 40," he said. "It was common practice at a lot of chemical manufacturing facilities." Ron Orwig, who now lives in Mount Pleasant, worked 13 years for Michigan Chemical. He agrees, citing one incident from 1974 or 1975. "I remember a hydrochloric acid tank, I don't know how many thousands of gallons were in it, that was being pumped, and whoever was pumping it forgot to open up the valve, and they sucked the bottom out of the tank. All that acid went right into the river." Even when the companies were abiding by the rules, the weak environmental laws of that time allowed problems to brew. "In the late 1970s, it became pretty obvious that disposal practices at chemical manufacturers were a major problem," Bails said. Sean Horne, project manager for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. is in charge of tearing down the last of the refineries which dominated the Alma landscape since Mid-West Refinery opened its doors in 1934. Shortly thereafter, three other refineries - Leonard, Wolverine and Northern - opened after the Durbin Gusher was discovered in the Mount Pleasant oilfields in 1935. Another - the McClanahan Refinery -opened in St. Louis but was bought by Leonard in 1938 and moved into Leonard's operation. Wolverine and Northern closed shortly thereafter. Alma's two remaining refineries kept employment steady until Mid-West was purchased by Leonard in 1966 and closed. In the early 1970s, Leonard was purchased by the French oil company Total and operated until 1999, when it closed. Sixty years of putting pollutants into area waterways overwhelmed the system, and now community members and officials are taking the steps to clean it. In St. Louis, the Environmental Protection Agency has named the river a Superfund site and is taking out sediments that read as high as 34,000 parts per million DDT, along with high levels of polybrominated biphenyls and hexabromobenzene. In addition, Scott Cornelius of the Environmental Response Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is seeking to correct a problem at the Michigan Chemical plant site that threatens the cleanup. In Alma, the EPA came to an agreement with UDS to put $9 million toward the cleanup of petroleum pollutants from Horse Creek and the Pine River. Jim Sygo, chief of the Waste Management Division of MDEQ, said more will be spent, if needed, to bring the waterway and other contaminated areas "to the satisfaction of the state and state guidelines." State officials thought they had the problem solved in St. Louis in 1982, when the state, the Environmental Protection Agency and Velsicol Chemical Co., which purchased Michigan Chemical Co. in the 1970s, signed an agreement to cap the 54-acre plant site and contain any pollutants there. In the agreement, no action was taken on the pollutants in the river, and officials today say they believed at the time that sediments would cover the pollution, keeping it out of the food chain. "At that time, that's what we thought," Bails said. Unfortunately, they were wrong.

 LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer Environmental groups criticized Israel on Tuesday for a plan to dump treated factory wastewater into the Mediterranean Sea. For decades, factories have been discharging untreated waste into the Kishon River, which empties into the Mediterranean at Haifa Bay north of Tel Aviv. But the Environment Ministry banned the practice beginning Tuesday. As part of a master plan to clean up the polluted river, a bypass pipe would be built to carry factory wastewater with certain types of salts directly to the sea. Environmental groups said the ministry had failed to research possible harm to plant and animal life in the sea. "There are organic wastes, poisons and metals in that water," said Sharon Shemesh-Rosenbaum, a spokeswoman for the Israeli branch of Greenpeace. "We don't trust the factories to let only salts flow through the pipe into the sea." The ministry said it is studying the environmental affect to determine the length of the bypass and a best location to minimize harm to the sea. Officials believe "releasing the effluent into the depths of the sea will not damage the quality of the sea water," a ministry statement said. About 700,000 cubic feet of untreated water were being dumped daily into the Kishon River. As of Tuesday, all wastewater must be treated before it is discharged. The push to clean up the Kishon began in 2000 when it was revealed that 40 out of 750 divers of an elite navy unit, who had carried out diving exercises in the river, contracted cancer. The Kishon River and Haifa Bay are lined with chemical factories, which have been dumping their waste into the waterway for decades. Greenpeace also criticized Israel for allowing the heavy pollution of the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv, which also flows into the Mediterranean Sea. ___ On the Net: Ministry of Environment: http://www.sviva.gov.il// Greenpeace Mediterranean: http://www.greenpeacemed.org.mt/

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer Praising the advantages of an environmental law it has criticized, the Bush administration announced agreements Wednesday with Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Alcoa Inc. to reduce air pollution in 16 states. The settlements under the "new source review" provisions of the Clean Air Act will result in nearly $680 million in spending to reduce about 130,000 tons of air pollution a year, Environmental Protection Agency and Justice Department officials said. "I'm willing to admit that this has been a very good tool," EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said of those provisions, which her agency changed last year. "But it's not the best we can do." Whitman and Assistant Attorney General Tom Sansonetti emphasized they will strongly pursue cases such as these even as the administration seeks further changes in the law. ADM , of Decatur, Ill., the nation's biggest ethanol producer, agreed to spend an estimated $350.9 million to settle charges it failed to accurately count emissions and expanded corn and oilseed processing facilities without installing proper pollution controls. The settlement filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois includes $213 million for new pollution controls over the next decade at 52 plants in 16 states. Those states are Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. It also includes $127 million to change the way it processes corn and oilseeds and to conduct environmental audits at all its facilities. Another $6.3 million will be spent to retrofit diesel engines in school buses and $4.6 million will go to a civil penalty. Sansonetti said the case builds on last year's settlement with 12 ethanol plants in Minnesota, the first time the federal government reached agreements mandating cuts in air pollution from manufacturers of corn-based ethanol, an additive in gasoline. Alcoa, Inc. of Pittsburgh, the world's largest aluminum producer, cast doubt on the $334.75 million settlement figure provided by the government. The Alcoa settlement _ which grew from a citizen group's complaint that its Rockdale, Texas, power plant improperly made changes that increased pollution _ was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Alcoa spokesman Kevin Lowery said it might be cheaper to close that coal-fired power plant and get energy elsewhere for its aluminum smelting facility there rather than spend the $330 million the government estimated it would cost to install new boilers. But the company will spend $2.5 million for conservation easements around the plant and $750,000 to retrofit school buses in Austin, Texas, and pay a $1.5 million civil penalty. Whitman said the agreements would reduce by 68,000 tons a year from Alcoa and by 63,000 tons a year from ADM emissions of air pollutants such as smog-causing nitrogen oxides and acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide. Sansonetti called it the first settlement of its kind involving the grain and oilseed processing industry. ADM spokeswoman Karla Miller said the company's new practices "will set the standard for our industry." The new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act date to 1977 and affect the way older industrial plants have to deal with air pollution when they expand, make major repairs or modify operations to increase efficiency. The Bush administration issued rules last year making it easier for industrial plants and refineries to modernize without having to buy expensive pollution controls, and it is still seeking changes what can be considered "routine maintenance, repair and replacement" at aging coal-burning power plants. Administration officials say their new approach removes barriers to production and innovation but opponents argue it undermines the Clean Air Act and is a giveaway to industry that lobbied heavily for easing the rules. ___ On the Net: EPA: http://www.epa.gov/air/nsr-review

 DON THOMPSON Associated Press Writer California sea otters' coastal environment may be so severely altered that scientists fear the species could be in jeopardy. Researchers at the University of California, Davis found the sea otters are dying in geographic clusters and from newfound diseases _ including a disease that makes them four times more likely to be killed by sharks. Their study came before 100 more southern sea otters washed up on California beaches this year, further reducing a population of about 2,000 that has been dwindling since 1995. The otters were hunted to near extinction for their luxuriously soft pelts by early in the last century. Their range once extended the length of the West Coast, but now is limited to California's central coast. In a normal population, the young and old are the most likely to die. But nearly half of the dead California otters _ 47 percent _ were in their adult prime, between the ages of 4 and 9 years old. Those otters also are in their prime breeding years, multiplying the impact of their loss. The researchers and the California Department of Fish and Game studied 105 adult sea otters, which are federally protected mammals, that died between February 1998 and June 2001. Disease killed nearly two-thirds _ 64 percent _ of the animals. Otters infected with one type of protozoa were four times more likely to be killed by sharks, the study revealed. The parasite invades the otter's brain where it can cause seizures, or make the animals confused or disabled. "They would be less able to evade sharks, more likely to swim to unprotected offshore waters, and more likely to shake and twitch, which attracts sharks," said the study's lead analyst, Christine Kreuder, a veterinarian at the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center. That parasite caused brain infections that killed half the otters found near Morro Bay. The shark attacks that can be a secondary cause of death, however, were clustered farther north, between Santa Cruz and Point Ano Nuevo. The parasite is found in domestic cat feces, while a second parasite is found only in opossums' droppings. A separate UC Davis study is trying to track how those land-based parasites get into the water, though storm water runoff is suspected. The study also said five of the six otters found along a 1 1/4-mile section of coastline in southern Monterey Bay died from eating a diet unusually high in sand crabs, which carry parasitic worms that can cause fatal abdominal infections. Heart disease also is killing otters, the researchers discovered, though they're now looking for the virus or bacteria they think is causing the unusual heart problems. The overall frequency of the disease deaths "indicates that the ecosystem is very unhealthy," said Jonna Mazet, who directs the university's Wildlife Health Center and leads its otter research programs. It's time to do something about it, urged Steve Shimek, executive director of The Otter Project, a nonprofit organization that focuses on research and conservation of the sea otter. "We know that the sea otter is in trouble. The (population) counts have gone down six of the last seven years. We also know we're losing our reproductive animals _ you can't do that forever before you crash" the population, Shimek said. "We know we have this problem. Can't we start working on the solution now?" he asked. That means better sewage treatment and banning the use of problem contaminants on shore, and controlling the accumulations in harbor areas where otters also congregate, Shimek said. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in April released a long-delayed recovery plan that blames human activities, from fishing and boating to pollution and oil spills, for the species' decline. Kreuder presented the findings at the International Association of Aquatic Animal Medicine annual meeting, and they are expected to be published in the July issue of Journal of Wildlife Disease. Results from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's annual spring otter count are expected in June. ___ On the Net: USGS Western Ecological Research Center: http://www.werc.usgs.gov California marine wildlife center: http://www.dfg.ca.gov/Ospr/marinewildlife/ The Otter Project: http://www.otterproject.org/is(underscore)sannicolas.html

 Michigan barred use on corn fields this year of a herbicide that has been blamed for contaminated water in other states. The Michigan Department of Agriculture rejected a request to allow Balance Pro use on the state's 2.2 million acres of corn this spring, Deputy Director of Agriculture Keith Creagh said Monday. Proponents of Balance Pro say many weeds have become resistant to herbicides already approved for use in the state. But Agriculture Director Dan Wyant followed a staff recommendation that warned of the product's potential risks. Those included contamination of surface and ground water, its classification as a probable human carcinogen and the state's inability to monitor the product's active chemical, isoxaflutole. Michigan already had temporarily banned the herbicide in 2001 and 2002, saying there was insufficient testing data. Balance Pro has been approved for use by 17 states but has been detected in stream in several of them, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA had approved Balance Pro, or isoxaflutole, in 1998 on a conditional basis, meaning states could outlaw its use. Last year, Wisconsin approved its use but with so many restrictions that the manufacturer decided not to sell it there. Minnesota also imposed severe restrictions on its use. "Lakes and reservoir samples in Nebraska and Missouri continued to show levels of Balance metabolites, some as late as 10 months after a single application," Kenneth Rauscher, director of the Pesticide and Plant Management Division of the Michigan Agriculture Department, wrote to Balance Pro's manufacturer, Bayer Crop Science. The company has said that there is no danger to groundwater and minimal concern over the chemical's accumulation in the environment. Conservationists praised the decision. "This is a really commendable action," said Dave Dempsey, policy adviser for the Michigan Environmental Council. "It is one of the few times I've seen the Ag Department act in a precautionary way." ___ On the Net: Michigan Department of Agriculture, http://www.michigan.gov/mda Bayer Crop-Science, http://www.bayercropscience.com/

 PIERRE SAUVEY Associated Press Writer Oil from a sunken tanker soiled France's southwestern coast Saturday, frustrating efforts by cleanup crews to contain the spreading pollution. Even as workers in white protective suits scooped up balls of oil with gloved hands, larger black clumps _ some as large as 18 inches across _ washed ashore. Local authorities appealed for extra help. "It's no longer little balls, but plates" of oil, said Col. Patrick Toufflet, a cleanup commander in the Landes region, south of Bordeaux, which mobilized about 100 workers, including soldiers and fire officers, on Saturday. Laboratory tests have traced oil from the Landes' beaches back to the aging tanker Prestige, which sank Nov. 19 off northwestern Spain. The tanker spilled thousands of tons of gluey oil, blackening vast swaths of the Spanish coast. Patches of oil began washing up along hundreds of miles of French beaches this week. Authorities in the Gironde region, north of the Landes, said Saturday that tests on oil found there confirmed that it also came from the Prestige. "The pollution … is on average twice what it was" on Friday, Paul Buchoux, a Gironde official, said Saturday. President Jacques Chirac vowed to go after ship owners and crews who try to sidestep maritime rules. "France and Europe will not allow shady businessman, rascals of the sea, to cynically profit from the lack of transparency," Chirac said Friday. Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, directed by Chirac to personally oversee management of the cleanup, also expressed outrage Friday as he trudged across oil-dirtied beaches at Cap Ferret, an Atlantic coastal town famous for its oyster beds. He promised an initial $52 million to help. The single-hulled Prestige was carrying 77,000 tons of oil when it sank. Spain's government drew stiff criticism at home for its handling of the oil slick _ notably for not acknowledging the scale of the disaster fast enough and failing to provide adequate resources for cleanup. Anxious to avoid similar criticism, Raffarin acted quickly to ease fears over the potential damage the slicks will have on the French fishermen and tourism.

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer Children are getting asthma at more than double the rate two decades ago, and one of every dozen women of childbearing age has blood mercury levels that could hinder brain development in a fetus, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday. EPA's report, only its second exhaustive roundup on environmental hazards to children's health, shows success in areas where the government has taken aggressive action, such as reductions in levels of children's blood lead poisoning and children's exposure to secondhand smoke. EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said the agency has done a lot to "improve the environment for children where they live, learn and play." Between 1980 and 1995, the report says, the percentage of children with asthma doubled, from 3.6 percent in 1980 to 7.5 percent in 1995. The percentage dropped in 1996 to about 6 percent, but by 2001 it had risen again, this time to 8.7 percent: 6.3 million children. Researchers don't know precisely why childhood asthma is increasing, but a number of factors in air quality, both outdoors and indoors, have been studied. Those varied factors include exposure to dust mites, cockroaches, pesticides, tobacco smoke, ozone and soot. The EPA says its officials are intent on examining the role of indoor air pollutants especially, since they note modest improvements in the numbers of children exposed to several outdoor air pollutants since 1990. About 5 million women _ 8 percent of those at the childbearing ages of 16 to 49 _ had at least 5.8 parts per billion of mercury in their blood as of 2000, the report says. EPA officials said this is the first time this kind of data has been measured. EPA has found that children born to women with blood concentrations of mercury above 5.8 parts per billion are at some risk of adverse health effects, including reduced developmental IQ and problems with motor skills such as eye-hand coordination. Mercury, a naturally occurring metal, is a persistent pollutant that accumulates in fish and becomes more concentrated as it moves up the food chain. The three major sources for mercury emissions have been power plants and municipal waste and medical waste incinerators. EPA has been regulating since the late 1990s mercury dumped in water and air from municipal waste and medical waste incinerators and considers it another success to have reduced levels emitted from each of those sources by 90 percent, EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said. The agency is writing regulations for mercury emitted from coal-fired power plants that are due to be completed in the next two years and are scheduled to take effect by 2007. The number of children with elevated levels of lead in their blood was 4.7 million in 1978 but had plunged to about 300,000 in 2000, the report says. EPA attributes most of that success to the phaseout of lead in gasoline between 1973 and 1995 and the reduction in the number of homes with lead-based paint from 64 million in 1990 to 38 million in 2000. The number of children whose blood levels showed effects from secondhand smoke declined by about one-fifth to one-half between 1988 and 2000, depending on levels of exposure. Those figures are obtained by tracking the amount of cotinine, a breakdown product of nicotine in blood. ___ On the Net: EPA: http://www.epa.gov

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer The Bush administration will propose abolishing a program begun under former President Clinton to reduce air pollution from older power plants once a nationwide cap on pollutants is set, EPA chief Christie Whitman said Wednesday. The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said the program no longer would be needed for power plants if Congress approves President Bush's "Clear Skies" plan. His proposal is intended to reduce the plants' emissions of acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide, smog-causing nitrogen oxide and mercury, a toxic chemical that contaminates waterways. Bush said last month he wants to set mandatory ceilings on total industry output and let companies earn and trade credits, with millions of tons of emissions projected to be reduced. If Congress goes along with the limits sought by Bush, the administration then would ask lawmakers to abolish the Clinton program, known as new source review, as it applies to power plants, Whitman said. But enforcement under the program would continue for refineries, paper mills and other industrial facilities, EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said. Bush wants to cut the current 11 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions each year to 4.5 million tons by 2010 and 3 million tons by 2018; the 5 million tons of nitrogen oxide emissions annually to 2.1 million tons by 2008 and 1.7 million tons by 2018; and mercury emissions from 48 tons a year to 26 tons by 2010 and 15 tons by 2018. "If the numbers are what the president proposed," Whitman said, and "we are actually getting, as I indicated, better reductions than under the current regulatory process … then new source review would become redundant and there would not be a need for it," she said. "That's not something we could do, that's something Congress would have to consider." In 1999, EPA and Justice Department officials began a more vigorous enforcement effort to make older power plants and refineries reduce their pollution. The Bush administration has drawn the ire of environmentalists and Democrats in Congress while preparing rule changes that might discourage new government lawsuits against operators of aging coal-fired power plants. The EPA will begin announcing its final plans for overhauling that program in the next few months. Environmentalists and congressional Democrats have expressed grave concerns about what the administration might do. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, contends that "special interests have been allowed to put their thumb" in the proposal, upsetting the proper balance. The Natural Resources Defense Council released internal EPA documents Wednesday that the environmental group said shows the EPA plans to let industries set fictional pollution-reduction targets while avoiding real limits for a decade or more. But Scott Segal, an attorney for six large utilities, said the president's approach makes obsolete the need for EPA's new source review for aging power plants. "Under a cap, old facilities and new facilities are treated the same," he said. ___ On the Net: Environmental Protection Agency: http://www.epa.gov National Resources Defense Council: http://www.nrdc.org

 H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer The head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday rejected environmentalists' complaints that an administration proposal to cut power plant pollution is a setback for cleaner air. EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said that President Bush's proposal is "the most aggressive initiative to cut air pollution in a generation" and will lower costs to industry while eliminating tons of chemicals that cause smog and acid rain and contaminate waterways with mercury. It will "achieve real air quality improvements," she told a seminar sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute and Brookings Institution. Since the plan was announced by the White House last week, it has been sharply attacked by environmentalists as a rollback of the progress already being made under a series of regulations that are on the books under the Clean Air Act. Environmentalists argue that some of the EPA's own projections of anticipated pollution reductions under its current rules would cut millions of additional tons of pollution than projected under the Bush proposal. Senior EPA officials strongly disagreed and said the numbers being cited by the environmental groups _ from an EPA briefing to industry last September _ were not intended to be accurate projections. "They do not reflect realistic projections," said EPA spokesman Joe Martyak. The Bush proposal, which will require congressional action, would replace many of the EPA's clean air rules with a broad market-based system of pollution caps and the authority to trade pollution credits as a way to achieve emission reductions, especially from older, coal-burning power plants. "We get dramatically greater reductions under the president's proposal than we could possibly get under the Clean Air Act," Jeffrey Holmstead, the head of the EPA's air office, told reporters Tuesday. Environmental groups said that some of the EPA's own internal analysis suggests that the Bush plan will allow 36 percent to 50 percent more pollution than would be allowed under current acid rain and smog-reducing regulations if they were fully implemented. At a briefing for the Edison Electric Institute last September, the EPA suggested that nitrogen oxide, the precursor to smog, could be cut by 75 percent to 1.25 million tons over the next decade under existing Clean Air Act rules, according to EPA documents obtained by environmental groups. Bush's market-based approach would cap nitrogen oxide at 2.1 million tons by 2008 and 1.7 million tons by 2018. The EPA presentation also envisioned sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, being reduced to 2 million tons under an EPA rule that will require reductions of soot and other microscopic particles. By comparison, the president's plan calls for a sulfur cap of 4.5 million tons by 2008 and 3 million tons by 2018. The Bush plan also envisions a push to regulate mercury from power plants, reducing these emissions from 48 tons today to 15 tons by 2018. The EPA is still developing a federal regulation to control mercury from power plants. According to EPA documents obtained by the National Environmental Trust, a leading environmental advocacy group, the EPA as recently as December estimated that mercury could be cut by as much as 90 percent, to 5.5 tons, if the best available technology were used under the planned regulations. "The president's plan is a Trojan horse for a rollback," argued Rebecca Stansfield of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, an environmental group. Holmstead said the numbers from the September briefing were "never intended to be a projection of where we would be under the current Clean Air Act," although the presentation was labeled a summary of a "business as usual" scenario. Last Friday, a day after the president announced the new power plant initiative, Holmstead presented another set of projections to congressional staffers that showed the president's plan in a much better light. The projections presented Friday estimated that over the next decade, under current regulations, nitrogen oxide would be cut to 4 million tons, sulfur dioxide to 9.1 million tons, and mercury to 43 tons. All these reductions fall well short of what Holmstead said the president's plan would achieve. "It's an attempt by EPA to rewrite history," said John Stanton of the National Environmental Trust, citing the disparity between the EPA number last September and those last week. __ On the Net: Environmental Protection Agency: http://www.epa.gov/

 KENJI HALL Associated Press Writer Japan, the host of talks in Kyoto that yielded the world's first global warming agreement, praised President Bush's anti-pollution alternative but said Friday it hopes the United States will return to the treaty. Germany, meanwhile, criticized President Bush's proposal, saying it was unlikely to help lower emissions of greenhouse gases and allowed the United States "to escape responsibility" for environmental protection. Offering an alternative to the 1997 greenhouse gas accord, Bush on Thursday proposed a plan he said would encourage businesses to cut pollution and develop more energy-efficient technology. Bush also proposed stricter emissions standards for power plants. In Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi welcomed the proposal, saying it demonstrated Bush's commitment to reduce harmful greenhouse gases. But Kawaguchi, who was Japan's environment minister until early this month, said Tokyo will continue lobbying Washington to accept the Kyoto protocol. "Japan hopes that the U.S. government will actively engage in the climate change negotiations," she said. German Environment Minister Juergen Trittin said Bush's plan was "disappointing" because it was voluntary and failed to set targets for cuts by the world's biggest polluter. "We must not slam the door for a return of the United States under the Kyoto protocol's regime," he said. "We must not let the country with the biggest emissions of greenhouse gases worldwide escape responsibility for protecting the global climate." In Brussels, European Union Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstroem said Bush's plan is "no alternative" to the Kyoto protocol. Kyoto, she said, "is the only effective international framework for combating global warming and we urge the United States to return to the Kyoto process." Australian Prime Minister John Howard called Bush's proposal "a very positive thing." But he remains firmly against ratifying the Kyoto accord unless the United States adopts it. Last November, delegates from 163 countries met to finalize the wording of the 1997 Kyoto protocol _ the landmark agreement committing industrialized countries to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases blamed for warming the Earth's atmosphere. The pact commits nations to rolling back emissions to 1990 levels. The United States, which emits a quarter of the world's greenhouse gases, withdrew from the negotiations last March. Bush said the accord would hurt U.S. businesses and unfairly exempted heavily polluting countries such as India and China from reductions. Without the United States, the Kyoto protocol must be ratified by almost every other industrialized country to become a treaty. Environmental groups were skeptical of Bush's proposal, particularly because it relies on voluntary efforts. Japanese business groups urged Tokyo to discuss the U.S. plan with European countries and seek common ground. "The government should seek an international framework that integrates the U.S. proposal and the Kyoto protocol," said Takashi Imai, head of the Federation of Economic Organizations, or Keidanren, a powerful business lobby group. Bush's proposal came days before a scheduled six-day trip to Asia, where he will meet leaders in Japan, China and South Korea. Some environmentalists worry Bush may try to coax Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi into abandoning the Kyoto accord. But Japan's new environment minister, Hiroshi Oki, said he expected Parliament to ratify the accord by June, even without United States participation.

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer Environmental pollution in North America dropped 5 percent between 1995 and 2000, according to a new study by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation set up under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The study released Thursday said two of the most notable trends reflected in the overall decline are a 28 percent drop in the amount of chemicals emitted into the air and a 41 percent increase in the amount of chemicals sent largely to off-premise landfills. In 2000, the total amount of pollution released or transferred elsewhere in the United States, Canada and Mexico was 3.6 million tons _ 1.5 million tons of it going into the air, water or ground, the study says. Of the remainder, more than 1 million tons went to recycling operations and the rest was sent for treatment, energy recovery or disposal. "It's a good news-bad news picture. The large facilities are continuing to track downwards on their releases overall. But then when you look at the small 'p' polluters … they're tracking upward," said Victor Shantora, acting executive director of the Montreal-based commission. Electric utilities, steel mills, chemical makers and other industries in three states _ Texas, Ohio and Pennsylvania _ and Canada's Ontario province accounted for as much as a fourth of the continent's pollutants, the study found. The five facilities reporting the largest total releases of pollution were operated by Kennecott Utah Copper in Magna, Utah; Chemical Waste Management in Arlington, Ore.; ASARCO Inc. in East Helena, Mont. and in Hayden Ariz.; and Magnesium Corp. of America in Rowley, Utah. Fourteen percent of the total pollution was in the form of chemicals such as styrene, lead and chromium and their compounds that are known or suspected carcinogens, the study said. Among the carcinogens, styrene was at the top of air pollutants _ more than 30,000 tons in 2000, the study said. The five biggest sources were facilities operated by Ameripol Synpol Corp. in Port Neches, Texas; Aguaglass Corp. in Adamsville and in McEwen, Tenn.; and Lasco Bathware Inc. in Cordele, Ga., and in Yelm, Wash. To establish the trend between 1995 and 2000, the study compares only those chemicals and industries that have consistently reported their pollution each of those years. Using those figures, the total amount of environmental pollutants released and transferred has decreased from 1.448 million tons in 1995 to 1.381 million tons in 2000. The study's authors noted that the trend shows several mixed pictures, reducing on-site releases in some cases but sending more wastes to landfills, treatment plants and other places away from their facilities. Larger polluters _ those reporting at least 110 tons annually _ showed a 7 percent decline in the amount of chemicals from 1998 to 2000, though they still accounted for about nine-tenths of all pollution reported. Smaller polluters _ those reporting less than 110 tons _ showed a 32 percent increase during that time. The study covers most industry in the United States and Canada, with companies in Mexico starting to voluntarily report figures. ___ On the Net: CEC: http://www.cec.org/home

 DuPont settled a chemical contamination case with people who said they were sickened by exposure to chemicals from a now-defunct DuPont munitions plant. Under the settlement, the company agreed to provide lifetime medical monitoring to 1,500 current and former residents, and allow 166 of the sickest to argue for monetary damages in front of an arbiter who will determine an award. Plaintiffs who get cancer also have the right to pursue additional compensation under the deal. DuPont admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement, which caps a 6-year-old case. DuPont operated the munitions plant in Pompton Lakes _ a working-class town of 10,000 residents _ for nearly a century before shutting it down in 1994. Residents allege lead, arsenic, mercury and other chemicals leaked from the site into soil and groundwater in the late 1980s. They claim the chemicals gave some people cancer, forced others to have hysterectomies and miscarriages and other ailments ranging from headaches and dizziness to depression.

 We applaud the judge who threw out a lawsuit seeking redress for people who live near Bhopal, even as we disagree with him. The 1984 gas leak killed thousands and poisoned the area. U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan said Union Carbide Corp., which had a 50.9 percent stake in the pesticide plant, had done enough and that too much time had passed. The judge cited Union Carbide’s 1994 sale of the property and construction of a hospital. Victims’ groups sought a medical monitoring program but were denied, with Keenan dismissing that as "extremely onerous on defendants, if not impossible." We agree that tracking down thousands of people thousands of miles away who were injured nearly 20 years ago would be a terrible burden. The time to set up medical monitoring was right away, and it is a grave oversight that it was not done. That doesn’t mean there’s nothing that can be done now. Some of the people who live near the contaminated site are desperately poor, lacking sanitary water. Some of the survivors of the Bhopal disaster were so disabled they have not been able to work since. There are doctors who seek answers about the exact chemical makeup of the gases leaked, and activists have gone so far as to appear at the home of Mike Parker, former Dow Chemical Co. chief executive officer, to reiterate that request. Even though Dow, which purchased Union Carbide as a wholly owned subsidiary, has tried to distance itself from the whole mess, we believe it has the resources available to find that information and provide it. Dow also has expertise in water purification membranes, and should consider offering those resources as well. We are not unsympathetic to Dow’s difficulties negotiating anything even remotely acceptable to Greenpeace and the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal. The two sides have talked, and seem not to get any closer to being able to work together to help the people of Bhopal. However, the site is owned by the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, and Dow has proven repeatedly it can work with government. Water systems and information dissemination are precisely the kinds of things governments can and should do, and it wouldn’t cost Dow very much to do so – in dollars. In goodwill, the company might even find it has gained.

 LUKAS I. ALPERT Associated Press Writer Most lower Manhattan residents are unlikely to suffer long-term illnesses from inhaling airborne pollution in the weeks after the World Trade Center collapse, the Environmental Protection Agency said. Citing measurements taken in and around the collapse zone, the draft report said Friday that only rescue workers and other people exposed to high concentrations of pollution immediately after the trade center attack are likely to develop chronic illnesses. It is unclear how many people inhaled smoke and dust from the collapse, some of which contained metals like lead and cadmium, PCBs, dioxin-like compounds, asbestos and other contaminants. The agency noted that no air testing was done until Sept. 14, 2001, so no definitive conclusions could be drawn about the first three days after the towers collapsed. Extensive testing did not begin until Sept. 18, the agency said. "It cannot be stated with certainty what effects resulted when people were engulfed in the initial cloud of dust or were subsequently exposed to the elevated concentrations that were found," the report said. Some lower Manhattan residents have criticized the EPA's response to their health worries about the smoke and dust that blanketed much of the area after the trade center attack. The main firefighters' union has claimed the city failed to provide firefighters enough respirators, leading to high rates of illness. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., who has pushed for long-term health monitoring of rescue workers and downtown residents, said Friday that the report does not end the debate. "We need to be diligent in continuing to monitor the short- and long-term health effects," she said. "We clearly have an obligation to provide health tracking services to the valiant men and women who worked at the trade center site." The EPA report comes a week after a team of private researchers and scientists said the chemical composition of the dust near ground zero appeared to be less toxic than initially feared. That study, to be published in the February issue of Environmental Science & Technology, also found that the particles collected were too large to lodge deep in people's lungs and cause long-term illness. ___ On the Net: EPA report: http://www.epa.gov/ncea/wtc.htm

 JOHN HEILPRIN Associated Press Writer The Bush administration will propose abolishing a program begun under former President Clinton to reduce air pollution from older power plants once a nationwide cap on pollutants is set, EPA chief Christie Whitman said Wednesday. The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said the program no longer would be needed for power plants if Congress approves President Bush's "Clear Skies" plan. His proposal is intended to reduce the plants' emissions of acid rain-causing sulfur dioxide, smog-causing nitrogen oxide and mercury, a toxic chemical that contaminates waterways. Bush said last month he wants to set mandatory ceilings on total industry output and let companies earn and trade credits, with millions of tons of emissions projected to be reduced. If Congress goes along with the limits sought by Bush, the administration then would ask lawmakers to abolish the Clinton program, known as new source review, as it applies to power plants, Whitman said. But enforcement under the program would continue for refineries, paper mills and other industrial facilities, EPA spokesman Joe Martyak said. Bush wants to cut the current 11 million tons of sulfur dioxide emissions each year to 4.5 million tons by 2010 and 3 million tons by 2018; the 5 million tons of nitrogen oxide emissions annually to 2.1 million tons by 2008 and 1.7 million tons by 2018; and mercury emissions from 48 tons a year to 26 tons by 2010 and 15 tons by 2018. "If the numbers are what the president proposed," Whitman said, and "we are actually getting, as I indicated, better reductions than under the current regulatory process … then new source review would become redundant and there would not be a need for it," she said. "That's not something we could do, that's something Congress would have to consider." In 1999, EPA and Justice Department officials began a more vigorous enforcement effort to make older power plants and refineries reduce their pollution. The Bush administration has drawn the ire of environmentalists and Democrats in Congress while preparing rule changes that might discourage new government lawsuits against operators of aging coal-fired power plants. The EPA will begin announcing its final plans for overhauling that program in the next few months. Environmentalists and congressional Democrats have expressed grave concerns about what the administration might do. The Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy, contends that "special interests have been allowed to put their thumb" in the proposal, upsetting the proper balance. The Natural Resources Defense Council released internal EPA documents Wednesday that the environmental group said shows the EPA plans to let industries set fictional pollution-reduction targets while avoiding real limits for a decade or more. But Scott Segal, an attorney for six large utilities, said the president's approach makes obsolete the need for EPA's new source review for aging power plants. "Under a cap, old facilities and new facilities are treated the same," he said. ___ On the Net: Environmental Protection Agency: http://www.epa.gov National Resources Defense Council: http://www.nrdc.org

 Caption Close For a long time political leaders in Southeast Texas were content to reap the many benefits from our petrochemical plants but do little about the downsides that affect the health and safety of people who live here. State Rep. Dade Phelan, R-Beaumont, has broken out of that mindset, and it’s about time. Phelan has called for the Legislature to do a lot more in next year’s session to protect plant workers and residents from industrial disasters and dangerous pollutants. After countless reports of excessive pollution and the TPC explosion in November (along with last month’s blast in Houston at the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing plant), this isn’t a difficult position to take. The need for more action should be obvious, and that includes more Republicans who have traditionally been reluctant to support stronger business regulations. No one wants to hamper free enterprise, but company profits and worker’s paychecks can’t come at the expense of anyone’s health and safety. Most of the petrochemical plants in this region are quite profitable, and they can afford the basic precautions in operations and equipment to minimize any danger. Many of them do that, but some need a nudge in the right direction. “From Houston to Baton Rouge, major chemical and refining incidents are occurring more frequently,” Phelan said in a strongly worded statement. “In addition, elevated benzene levels have been reported in Southeast Texas and Houston over the last year. This is unacceptable. … While accidents do occur ... we must identify how these events could have been prevented and take legislative action.” Phelan cited more funding for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and that’s an excellent idea. Cities and counties in the region don’t have the expertise or staff to take on this complex challenge. But TCEQ does, and it could its job better with more resources — and tougher penalties for violations. Lawmakers also should require certain levels of insurance for industrial facilities to offset any costs to local communities for explosions or leaks. TPC is a large corporation and apparently has the resources to pay for the damage from its explosion. But in Houston, the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing plant was a much smaller facility, and it has already declared bankruptcy despite causing far more damage than the Port Neches blast. People in Houston who were injured by that explosion or saw extensive property damage may get no compensation. The Texas House and Senate must not ignore the dangerous trend line. Texans deserve to see a sharp reduction in these incidents, and legislative action can help make that happen.

 By James Osborne Refineries and chemical plants along the Houston Ship Channel. Refineries and chemical plants along the Houston Ship Channel. Caption Close Refineries and chemical plants along the Houston Ship Channel. Refineries and chemical plants along the Houston Ship Channel. WASHINGTON - Senate Republicans are pressing ahead on legislation loosening regulations dictating when industrial facilities need to upgrade their air pollution controls. The bill, which has a hearing in the Senate Wednesday, follows on from efforts by the Trump administration to limit when polluting facilities come under what the EPA terms the New Source Review Program, requiring often costly upgrades for refineries, power plants and petrochemical facilities. “The New Source Review program has held power plants and manufacturing factories back from improving efficiency," said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "Our legislation will cut government red tape and make it simpler for manufacturers to get the permits they need to improve their plants. The result will be cleaner, increased production.” POLLUTION DEBATE: In bid to speed up EPA, Pruitt takes on entrenched air pollution system But in doing so Republicans risk worsening air pollution in areas like Houston, where the prevalence of industrial facilities along the Houston Ship Channel has long caused the city to fall beneath federal air quality standards. John Walke, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the bill, "would let industries pollute more, by significantly higher amounts, and in the process, evade air pollution controls and pollution offsets in areas already experiencing unsafe air quality." But for petrochemical companies and the rest of the industrial sector, the numerous regulations they must comply with in order to expand or build new facilities has become so laborious a process they maintain it's sometimes better not to build. Jeff Holmstead, a Washington energy attorney and former assistant administrator for air and radiation at the EPA, described in written testimony ahead of the hearing a system that, "has become a Kafkaesque tangle of convoluted, burdensome and completely unnecessary regulations guidance documents, applicability determinations, and court decisions." "In some parts of the country, it effectively bans the construction of new facilities even if they use state-of-the-art pollution controls and would not have a meaningful impact on the environment – and even though the communities where they would be located desperately want them to be built," he wrote.

 By Perla Trevizo Caption Close While the remnants of Tropical Depression Imelda contributed to the release of less overall air pollution than initially estimated, the region saw some increases in emissions, including of cancer-causing benzene, state reports show. Overall, industrial businesses released about 81,000 pounds of pollutants, according to final reports submitted to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality — down from early estimates of nearly 95,000 pounds. Initially, about a dozen facilities reported unauthorized releases from Sept. 18 through 21, triggered by electrical outages, the failure of floating roof tanks and equipment malfunctions caused by flooding from the storm, which brought more than 40 inches of rain in 72 hours in some parts of Southeast Texas. Together, these companies concentrated in Jefferson, Harris and Brazoria counties reported releasing toxins, including cancer-causing 1,3 butadiene, benzene and ethylene oxide. Companies have 24 hours to report unauthorized emissions but can make revisions within two weeks. When a big storm strikes, refineries and other chemical facilities are especially vulnerable. Plants may shut units down in advance as a precaution and then restart after the storm, which can lead to the release of harmful pollutants. During Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the industry reported releasing 8.3 million pounds of nonpermitted air pollution, according to an analysis of state data by the Environmental Integrity Project in Austin. “Both benzene and 1,3 butadiene are cancer-causing toxic air pollutants of great concern in Houston. There is no safe level of exposure to these pollutants,” said Loren Hopkins, chief environmental science officer for the Houston Health Department. “While we don’t really know the long-term consequences of spikes such as those that have occurred during emergencies like Harvey,” she said, “we do know that we need to limit exposure to them as much as possible. It is important to know the correct amount of emissions in a timely fashion to inform public health decisions.” About 336 pounds of benzene were released in Harris County, a 44 percent increase from initial estimates, but the bulk of the carcinogen, nearly 1,200 pounds, were released in Jefferson County, home to Beaumont and Port Arthur, according to an analysis of state data by Air Alliance Houston and verified by the Houston Chronicle. Another 2,100 pounds of 1,3 butadiene were reportedly released in all three counties. Some plants file initial reports as a precaution; others make revisions after determining the emissions were below thresholds for reporting or authorized by a permit. Companies use a wide range of tools to make the estimates, including process data and engineering calculations, according to reports submitted to the state. The decrease in emissions was largely due to revisions from Exxon Mobil Corp. facilities in Harris and Jefferson counties, TCEQ data show. In the aftermath of Imelda, the Beaumont chemical plant reported releasing about 36,500 pounds of pollutants over 24 hours as a result of having to shut down. But in the final report, the company revised its estimates to about 30,300 pounds. The Baytown facility revised early estimates of emissions from 5,300 pounds of volatile organic compounds over 48 hours, when the storm caused a floating roof to fail, to about 3,000 pounds. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.’s Beaumont chemical plant also reported releasing about 4,500 pounds of pollutants, 76 percent less than initially estimated. However, the company later estimated that between Sept. 29 and Oct. 21 it would release nearly 31,000 pounds of carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides (which are ozone precursors). Goodyear attributed this to unscheduled startups of five units that had to shut down due to flooding and electricity loss caused by Imelda, according to initial reports to the TCEQ. Most other facilities reported some increases, such as Equistar Chemicals LP in La Porte, which added 2,548 pounds of net emissions, mostly carbon monoxide and propane. Meredith Matthews, a spokeswoman for Houston-based LyondellBasell, which Equistar is part of, said the company adheres to TCEQ’s regulations that require initial notification based on preliminary information, followed by a final report that includes more detailed information wthin two weeks after the emissions event ends. “We strive to limit our impact to the environment and work to operate safely and responsibly,” she said in a written statement. “These revisions appear to be typical of emissions event final reports,” said Matt Van Vleck, air supervisor with Harris County Pollution Control. “In all, Harris County fared remarkably well in terms of emissions events given the magnitude of the flooding event and in comparison to the 3.5 million pounds of volatile organic compounds emitted as a result of Harvey.” The department is still investigating. The major takeaway from the reports is the need for better information about what communities are potentially exposed to and the quantities during extreme weather events such as Harvey or Imelda, said Corey Williams, research and policy director at Air Alliance Houston. “If the facility doesn’t know what it’s emitting or what quantities, the community is even more in the dark, with no idea what they are being exposed to in these events,” he said. While some pollution releases during natural disasters may be unavoidable, there are improvements the state and the industry can make to minimize emissions, the Environmental Integrity Project wrote in its 2018 report after Harvey, “Preparing for the Next Storm.” Among other things, the D.C.-based nonprofit, recommended that: TCEQ plan, coordinate, and stagger shutdowns of major industrial facilities during hurricanes and other disasters, as well as the subsequent firing up of plants, to minimize pollution impacts ; Refineries and other petrochemical plants better prepare in advance of hurricanes; TCEQ develop a plan and obtain equipment necessary to accurately monitor air quality during these events. This week, TCEQ announced an investment of more than $1.5 million to improve the agency’s air-monitoring capabilities, including being able to provide communities and local governments more real-time data during natural disasters or accidents. The state’s environmental agency plans to equip up to three vans with real-time, mobile air-monitoring technology and add three fixed air-monitoring stations, in addition to 15 handheld monitors the agency already bought. About two-thirds of the money was included in the most recent state budget, with the remainder coming from savings in the environmental agency’s 2019 budget. “This new equipment will expand TCEQ’s ability to rapidly assess air quality, particularly around petrochemical facilities, but it will also help with daily monitoring of ambient conditions, including the Houston Ship Channel area,” Toby Baker, the agency’s executive director, said in a news release. perla.trevizo@chron.com

 Midland Daily News A 10-year-old girl set a big example for young and old when she recently saw a lot of trash that had accumulated in a roadside ditch in southern Gladwin County. She decided she was old enough, strong enough and smart enough to go clean it up. It had nothing to do with Earth Day, although the cleanup began this spring, and produced a local newspaper story that was just in time to coincide with Earth Day, the annual celebration of our world. Mackenzie Knake set an example for all of us when she just decided that trash and water bottles don't belong in ditches. Just like fast-food bags and plastic cups and cigarette butts and all the other things that motorists throw out their windows. While this girl can clean up the mess near her property, and set an example for every property owner in the Great Lakes Bay Region, what she cannot do is give a good lecture to the less respectful people who regularly pollute nature. Parents should be teaching their children that it is a poor habit and often breaking the law to dispose of trash improperly. We also trust that most schools are getting that word out -- especially during weeks like this one that correspond with Earth Day. Corporations, like Dow, are also coming through with larger contributions to major throwaway problems, like the plastic that is accumulating in our oceans. Hearing and seeing a young girl cleaning up a roadside should make all of us think twice about pollution and taking responsibility for our own property. It doesn't have to be Earth Day to make smart decisions about our planet. This is something we can do every day. Thanks, Mackenzie, for reminding us how it's done.

The Cypress Creek Watershed Partnership is working to improve the water quality of Cypress Creek. A section of Cypress Creek near Towne Lake. The Cypress Creek Watershed Partnership is working to improve the water quality of Cypress Creek. A group of local stakeholders continues working to identify, measure and mitigate direct causes of water pollution in Cypress Creek. The Cypress Creek Watershed Partnership whose members include local government figures, business owners and residents, began hosting public meetings earlier this year to spread the partnership’s message and form a steering committee. The 11-member committee is overseeing the creation of a watershed protection plan, or WPP, to reduce the amount of water pollution within Cypress Creek. Related: Community-led committee to work on fixing Cypress Creek water quality On Nov. 14 and 19, the CCWP hosted work group meetings to discuss possible direct causes for water pollution and brainstorm ideas for measuring those causes. According to data already collected by the CCWP, fecal waste from pets — specifically pet dogs — accounts for approximately 80 percent of the bacteria in the creek. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Houston-Galveston Area Council are facilitating the partnership’s strategy development process with help from a grant provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Justin Bower, senior planner with H-GAC, led the meetings, which he said are meant to gather recommendations and information for the partnership before the steering committee approves recommendations for the next phase of reducing waste in the watershed. Human waste During the Nov. 14 work group meeting at Barbara Bush Library, Bower met with interested community members and local stakeholders to discuss human-related sources, including pet waste. The partnership website states that certain sections of the watershed’s waterways have levels of fecal contaminants exceeding Texas’ limit for recreational use. The fecal contamination comes from a variety of sources, including human wastewater and animals, according to the website. Bower said human waste is more likely to get humans sick than animal waste or other sources. Related: Fecal matter in Cypress Creek prompts watershed protection plan Attendees suggested better educating other community members about the dangers of exposure to stormwater due to pollution, more frequent unannounced testing of wastewater treatment plants, and reinforcing the importance of picking up waste from pets. Part of the issue is knowing generally what kind of waste is coming in-stream, but not being able to pinpoint where exactly the sources of pollution are the worst. For instance, data collected at wastewater treatment plants is being accounted for in the WPP, but the exact levels of pollution along the waterway are not specified. “We recommend looking for resources to do additional in-stream targeted sampling,” Bower said. “Let’s say we have an issue with one tributary. Do some targeted sampling up and down there so we can start to say, ‘It’s good here, it’s good here, what’s in between those.’” Bower said when contaminant sources are found, then the CCWP can work with Harris County and the TCEQ to address those sources contributing to water quality issues. Bower said the CCWP is speaking with apartment complexes and neighborhoods to get a better sense of how many people pick up their pet waste and if they have the resources available to do so, such as pet waste disposal stations. The information gathered may result in a lower documented percentage of waste from pets than was previously thought. “We just assumed when we populated dog numbers that those dogs are producing waste that is making it to the stream, which isn’t necessarily the case,” he said. “We’ll find a conservative estimate to reduce that number by to reflect ownership.” Livestock and wildlife waste While livestock waste, including cows, horses, goats, sheep and pigs, may not be the largest contributor to the pollution of Cypress Creek, Bower said it is still an issue for the partnership to address during the work group meeting about agriculture, wildlife and invasive species’ impact on water quality Nov. 18 at the Weekley Community Center. Currently the CCWP is looking for more direct measurement of livestock populations near the waterways to determine the actual impact and significance of their waste. Bower said the CCWP is already aware they need to reduce their previously measured impact of animal waste on Cypress Creek downstream. “When we looked at the numbers initially, we had about 10 percent of the total amount of watershed coming from cattle or livestock,” he said. “Unsurprisingly most of them are out on the prairie or west of (SH)99. We looked at the cattle numbers versus the stocking rates that some of the district board members suggested ... and our numbers were actually pretty close.” Mary Anne Piacentini, executive director of the Katy Prairie Conservancy, said the conservancy is working to keep cattle from polluting the waterways. “On Warren Ranch all of our streams now are fenced off so the cattle are not getting into our streams,” she said. “So, you’ve got 600 cattle that aren’t getting to the stream that way. The hope is that we’re going to be able to do more of that on our other properties if we get to convert all of our herds.” Just like with other sources, the closer the source is to the stream, within a buffer that the CCWP has determined, the more impact their waste will have on the waterway. Bower said waste from agriculture is not necessarily the main issue, but it still needs to be stopped and people need to be warned to avoid contact with the water if possible. As for species like feral hogs and deer, sparse data is present for either group right now. Feral hogs can be a problem for the watershed due to their high reproductive rates, tendency to destroy vegetation and destabilize streams, along with their waste, Bower said. Bower said feral hog concentrations are higher in the western portion of Harris County with less development. “The largest percent (of waste feral hogs produce) in any of the watershed is about 4 percent before we move the numbers so they’re going to be probably about 6 or 7 (percent) in the western most part,” he said. Deer waste contribution data is also sparse but needs measurement. Bower said data is needed for all other wildlife, but probably won’t be a major consideration unless they have a large impact in larger numbers. For instance, birds are not perceived as having as large of an impact as other sources. What now? The CCWP will host a public meeting Nov. 21 to provide information on past meetings and receive more feedback and suggestions for the WPP. Information about the partnership and future efforts can be found at https://cypresspartnership.weebly.com/. Bower suggested citizens do all they can to prevent waste from polluting waterways by attending CCWP meetings and doing their part within their daily life. “We’re not talking about the old days of the smoke stack coming out of the factory, we’re talking about the cumulative impact of everything everyone’s doing,” he said. “Walk your dog? Pick it up. It’s better than drinking it.” chevall.pryce@chron.com

 By Macklin Reid A Ridgefield town truck clears Bennett’s Farm Road of snow and ice. Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017 A Ridgefield town truck clears Bennett’s Farm Road of snow and ice. Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017 Caption Close A Ridgefield town truck clears Bennett’s Farm Road of snow and ice. Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017 A Ridgefield town truck clears Bennett’s Farm Road of snow and ice. Sunday, Feb. 12, 2017 Winter’s ice and snow will return, and the town’s red trucks will be out spreading a salt-based product on the roads to help keep them clear — for another year, anyway. But a committee of town officials will be undertaking what they envision as a wide-ranging study of what other communities around the nation do, seeking alternatives to putting salt on the roads — where it drains into and pollutes groundwater, aquifers, wetlands and watercourses. “There’s really no alternative to salt,” Dave Buccitti of the town highway department told the Board of Selectmen. Buccitti, Public Works Director Peter Hill, Planning and Zoning Director Richard Baldelli and Planning and Zoining Commission Chairwoman Rebecca Mucchetti joined the selectmen’s Aug. 21 meeting for a discussion of using salt on the roads, and the environmental implications of the practice. First Selectman Rudy Marconi said that at a meeting earlier in the year of Western Connecticut Council of Governments, the regional planning agency Ridgefield belongs to, a representative of the state Department of Health’s Public Drinking Water Section had said wetlands running along highways show signs of the problem that use — or, at least, overuse — of ice-melting products can create. “There is no sign of any wildlife,” he said, “ because of the salt.” Additives “The salt we use, it’s treated. It’s supposed to be environmentally-friendly,” said Hill. Ice-thawing products use a variety of additives — “molasses, beet juice, pickle juice” — but always in combination with salt, Buccitti said. Salt alone is effective only down to about 27 degrees Fahrenheit, Hill said, and the various additives lower the temperature range in which it is effective. But none of that will address the long-term problem of salt polluting groundwater, which the selectmen have been talking about since they were addressed on the concern some months by a well driller, Henry Boyd. Thursday’s meeting kicked around some ideas. “We could go back to sand and salt,” Marconi said. For many years the town used a sand-salt mixture, but for the last eight years — since 2007-08 — the town dropped the sand and has been using a “straight salt” treatment on icy roads. In the old days snowy roads were simply covered with sand, but sand alone becomes less useful in providing traction once it begins to be “pulverized” by traffic rolling over it, according to Public Works Director Hill. “Sand is good for the first 12 cars,” he said. Sherman’s woes Marconi spoke of the problems in nearby Sherman, where the town has been doing studies to figure out what to do about five public wells that had been polluted with road salt. “The wells were shallow, 40 to 80 feet,” Marconi said. Sherman has reportedly spent tens of thousands of dollars on bottled water for public buildings, and voters there will soon be asked to appropriate $15,000 for drilling a new well to serve the town’s firehouse and a playhouse — but the town isn’t even sure this will solve the problem, and it may also have to address problems with the well serving Sherman Town Hall. Marconi said that the state’s “allowable limit” for salt in drinking water is 28 milligrams per liter and drinking water in Ridgefield could surpass that “if we continue our current trend in five to eight years.” Marconi said he’d asked state authorities about the problem. “I said, ‘How are we going to address it?’ They said, ‘We already have. We’re going to raise the limit to 100.’ ” That might address legal and bureaucratic issues, but it wouldn’t reduce health concerns related to the level of salt in the drinking water. Public Works Director Hill said the state Department of Transportation had in recent years been using a different product on its highways. “They switched to magnesium chloride — which is killing our bridges,” Hill said. Marconi said the road treatments also create a problem with the undersides of vehicles — brake lines, transmission lines — rotting out within six, seven, eight years. Hill noted that road salt might not be the only — or even the biggest — contributor to salt in Ridgefield’s groundwater. “Fifty percent of homes in Ridgefield are being treated with water softeners,” he said. “...How does that affect someone, versus putting salt on the road?” Study committee The interdepartmental study committee that will be looking into winter road treatments includes Dave Buccitti and Peter Hill for the Public Works Department, Planning and Zoning Director Richard Baldelli, Assistant Planner Daniel Robinson, Wetlands Agent Beth Peyser, and P&Z administrator Aarti Paranjape, as well as selectmen Marconi and Kozlark. Baldelli described for the Aug. 21 meeting the ambitious approach the study committee will take in looking for potential solutions. “What we anticipate doing is, initially, research,” Baldelli said. “We’re going to look at it countrywide. We’re going to see what other agencies do — especially in sensitive areas, like the Great Lakes and Mississippi River,” he said. “Snow removal in the Northeast is different from Minnesota — we have freeze-thaw, freeze-thaw,” Baldelli said. One of the questions will be “whether there’s a way to quantify the actual damage from various products,” he said. “There’s a variety of things we’re going to look into,” Baldelli said. “One addition I wanted to make is liability,” Marconi said. “Whatever we do we want to make sure we’re not creating liability.” “Safety is our number one issue,” said Baldelli. “We’d never compromise that.” The committee’s first meeting was on Thursday, Aug. 22, and Selectwoman Kozlark said afterwards that while the work would take some time, she was hopeful it would be productive in the long run. “Planning is taking the lead on studying the effects and possible approaches to mitigate the salt usage,” Kozlark said. “It was an initial step and nothing will be implemented until fully vetted for safety and health of the town.” She added, “At this time the town doesn’t have a good alternative to the ‘Ice B’Gone.’ I think it is encouraging that the town is initiating this discussion with the intent of some kind of implementation in the future.”

 Caption Close The operational changes approved last week for the Oxbow Calcining plant in Port Arthur are supposed to reduce the pollution coming from its smokestacks, and Port Arthur residents will be hoping that happens. But the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shouldn’t regulate on the basis of hope or good intentions. That state agency should be focused on hard data and measurable improvements. It must monitor this plant closely in the coming months to answer a simple question: Is more or less pollution is being emitted from Oxbow’s smokestacks? As it is, Oxbow discharges more than 2,000 tons per year of sulfur dioxide. Because of that dubious distinction, it is one of several plants across the nation required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to have an air-quality monitor nearby. Yet some local and environmental activists are concerned that this change will make it harder to measure exactly what is being discharged into the sky. The change essentially allows Oxbow to exclusively release exhaust at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Previously, it released exhaust out of three smokestacks at 400 degrees Fahrenheit and 2,000 degrees from one additional. But one activist said that with the additional heat, the emissions could be going up and over the nearest air-quality monitor, ending up in a different part of Port Arthur. If that happens, there’s no net improvement in Port Arthur’s air quality. The sulfur dioxide might be affecting a different neighborhood more, but clearly no one can be satisfied with a shift like that. Oxbow officials maintain that they are operating within the limits of state and federal permits, and that may be true in a technical sense. But that all hinges on accurate monitoring of emissions, which is precisely what this change could affect. As it is, one monitor has been temporarily relocated because of construction in the area, and the state agency is working with the EPA to evaluate sites for a permanent location. This issue reinforces a basic point about the petrochemical plants in the region: Southeast Texans appreciate the jobs and tax revenues they produce, but that prosperity can’t come at the expense of our health and safety. Most plants do meet this environmental challenge and still make a profit. With better technology, that’s much more doable than years ago. Oxbow Calcining should be able to meet this standard, too, and state and federal regulators must ensure that it does.

 Jordyn Hermanijordyn.hermani@hearstnp.com In an effort to invest and develop in new global initiatives and solutions that work to prevent and remove plastic waste in the environment, Dow Chemical Co. will be joining a $100 million effort to finance companies and infrastructure that prevent waste in oceans. The announcement was made during a recent Our Ocean Conference in Bali, Indonesia. Dow will be joining several other major global brands to become a founding investor in Circulate Capital. The company also announced at the conference that it intends to donate an additional $1 million to Ocean Conservancy over the next two years to support waste collection and recycling solutions in Southeast Asian countries. This money would be used for projects that build the capacity of local non-governmental organizations and partnerships with city leaders to develop, scale and replicate implementable solutions. "Dow is leading the way in our industry -- by applying circular economy logic, collaborating across the value chain, innovating new products, and through the commitment of our employees and customers -- to put an end to plastic waste in the environment," said Jim Fitterling, chief executive officer of Dow, in a press release. "We will continue to seek opportunities to work with our industry partners, brand owners, local, national and international governments, NGOs and consumers to ensure that we develop true circular economy solutions for plastics." Circulate Capital's mission is to demonstrate the viability of investment in the waste management and recycling sectors to attract the institutional investment capital needed to scale integrated recycling and waste management companies and infrastructure across South and Southeast Asia. These regions have been identified as contributing disproportionately to ocean plastic pollution primarily because they lack the critical waste infrastructure to manage the problem. Circulate Capital expects to receive $100 million in combined funding from a variety of the world's leading consumer packaged goods and chemical companies. Ocean Conservancy is working to protect the ocean from today's greatest global challenges. Together with its partners, the organization creates science-based solutions for a healthy ocean and the wildlife and communities that depend on it. Dow has been partnering with Ocean Conservancy for more 20 years. As a major sponsor of the organization's annual International Coastal Cleanup, Dow and Ocean Conservancy founded the Trash Free Seas Alliance in 2012, a coalition of businesses, academics and NGOs, to analyze and address upstream causes of ocean plastic pollution.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency held a press in September in Durham to announce construction had begun on installation of a new water line to provide clean drinking water to the residences and MIDDLETOWN — Clean drinking water, the absence of which has plagued more than four dozen households and firms along a section of Main Street for 30 years, will become a reality in two years, thanks to the cooperation of countless agencies and individuals. In all, 50 private wells serving 54 locations are contaminated, requiring the distribution of bottled water and the installation of carbon treatment systems as a temporary solution, according to Environmental Protection Agency officials, who celebrated the momentous occasion Tuesday at the Durham Meadows Superfund Site. Federal, state and local officials converged on 281 Main St. to herald the start of a $24.4 million construction project for a water line from Middletown to the town center, work expected to be complete in 2020. Superfund areas are thousands of contaminated sites across the nation that exist due to dumping of hazardous waste, left out in the open, or otherwise improperly managed. These sites include manufacturing facilities, processing plants, landfills and mining sites, according to the EPA. First Selectwoman Laura Francis summed up the feelings of frustration that have permeated discussions for years. “Today is the day that the emotions of the town of Durham residents, which have been concern, fear and anger, change to comfort, relief and gratitude,” she said. #Middletown Mayor Drew talks at presser announcing construction of new waterline from city to #Durham Meadows Superfund site off Main Street - explains parents’ fears of carcinogens #2/2 pic.twitter.com/fEpu4TprRf Francis recalled inheriting the project 12 years ago, when she was first elected. “Leadership matters, expect results” was the campaign slogan that carried her to political victory, Francis said. Since that time, the first selectwoman has discovered the true meaning of such a promise, she told the nearly three dozen people gathered on the sunny morning. “Leadership means that, without a title, without authority over the final decision, without any personal reward, you work to do the right thing. You do the thing that is just for the people,” she said. Nearly six miles of water line — about 30,000 feet — will be installed to allow connection to Middletown’s water system of 120 homes and industrial firms, including Coginchaug High School, Strong Middle School and the Durham Fairgrounds, officials said. #Middletown Mayor Drew talks at presser announcing construction of new waterline from city to #Durham Meadows Superfund site off Main Street - explains parents’ fears 1/2 of carcinogens pic.twitter.com/MgvG4Alo5t EPA Regional Administrator Dennis Deziel was joined by Col. William Conde of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes, and Middletown Mayor Dan Drew to celebrate the groundbreaking. It will connect residents whose wells are impacted by the site to a public water supply. For more than a decade, residents have been using potable water for drinking. The site includes land owned by the Durham Manufacturing Co. and the former Merriam Manufacturing Co. Both firms used various chlorinated solvents, including trichloroethene, which has been detected in groundwater in concentrations as high as 1,400 parts per billion (280 times the safe level), according to the EPA. A large area of contamination and the associated source areas were designated as the Durham Meadows Superfund Site in 1989, the EPA said. “The solution to this problem was far from elegant. It didn’t fit in a box with a big bow on top of it. It was messy, and, at time, elusive,” Francis said. The work necessitated the forming of strategic partnerships, she added. “It’s a model for other communities to emulate.” The project will encompass the building of an 800,000-gallon water storage tank at the top of the Talcott Ridge in Middletown, which also will provide fire protection, according to AECOM Project Manager Richard M. Berlandy. EPA Regional Administrator Dennis Deziel said restoring clean drinking water and returning land to protected use is his agency’s top priority. “We’ve made substantial progress,” he said. DEEP is paying for 10 percent of construction costs. Ninety percent of the funding comes from federal partners, Dykes said. “We know it’s been a long road to get here. There were a lot of solutions to consider, a lot of different alternatives, but this type of collaboration — [municipalities] coming together — to provide the most critical assurance around clean drinking water for the community of Durham is absolutely essential,” she added. Francis summed up the import of Tuesday’s announcement. “Having this project complete will be the most transformational thing that has happened to Durham since, possibly, the [discovery of] the contamination, which will “revitalize” Main Street, as well as provide much-needed fire protection, she added. “Like the colonel said, ‘Let’s move some dirt!’”

 EPA wants to clamp down on emissions in Texas. Emissions that contribute to ozone pollution come from refineries and major petrochemical plants such as ExxonMobil and other motor fuels refineries in Southeast Texas and chemical plants that make synthetic rubber or chemicals used in making plastics. These emissions can combine with heat and sunlight to form ozone at ground level and is considered a pollutant that can harm people. That is why the EPA wants more control of these emissions.

Valentino Mauricio/The Enterprise EPA wants to clamp down on emissions in Texas. Emissions that contribute to ozone pollution come from refineries and major petrochemical plants such as ExxonMobil and other motor fuels refineries in Southeast For years the biggest challenge to air quality in Southeast Texas has come from the four major oil refineries that make their home here. But a recent study by the Environmental Integrity Project identified 90 plants from Port Arthur to Houston that make plastics — and which emitted 55,704 tons of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides in 2017. That’s a lot of emissions, especially since this issue has largely been under the radar until reports like this come out. The plants themselves must strive to reduce this output as much as possible every year. In turn, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must make sure they are operating safely and efficiently. The plastics industry is already estimated to be responsible for about a fourth of the air pollution in the region, but this is also the fastest-growing segment of the petrochemical business. The number of new plastics plants and expansion projects could double in coming years. Much of that growth stems from the surge in cheap natural gas supplies that fuel these plants. Yet according to the EIP study, nearly two-thirds of the 90 plastics plants studied had violated air-pollution limits over the last five years. Many of these discharges could be reduced since they were attributed to failures to properly test and maintain piping, pumps and controls. Moreover, the costs for these violations need to be stiffer. The EIP report found that state regulators imposed penalties on violators for only 57 of 872 unpermitted emissions producing about 11 million pounds of air pollution. Yet the fines for all these violations totaled only $665,000 — about 6 cents per pound of illegal pollution. That’s not good enough. The fines should produce a real incentive to follow state and federal laws instead of being regarded as a minor annoyance to be paid and forgotten. This should concern plant officials, too, since their workers and managers breathe the same air as the rest of us, and they’re even closer to the source of potential pollution. The technology to reduce pollution and operate efficiently gets better each year. It must be matched by a real desire by plant officials to operate cleanly and safely — all the time. The jobs and tax revenues from these plants is welcome, of course. But it cannot come at the expense of our air quality, now or later on.

FILE-- An offshore oil rig docked for repairs in Sabine Pass, Texas, Nov. 4, 2018. The Trump administration on Sept. 12, 2019, is completed the legal repeal of a major Obama-era clean water regulation, which WASHINGTON - For years, the fight over how much power the federal government should have to regulate the wetlands and tributaries that feed into the nation's largest rivers has played out across the country. In the halls of Washington and on sprawling farms and ranches, in courtrooms and corporate boardrooms, a legal tug of war has unfolded over a 2015 rule that gave the Environmental Protection Agency much broader authority over the nation's waterways. Critics say the Obama rule gave the federal government far too much power; supporters countered that it would prevent the loss of vast swaths of wetlands. Court rulings have temporarily blocked the regulation in 28 states, while keeping it in effect in 22 others. On Thursday, the Trump administration plans to scrap the Obama-era definition of what qualifies as "waters of the United States" under the Clean Water Act, returning the country to standards put in place in 1986. "What we have today is a patchwork across the country," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview. "We need to have a uniform regulatory approach." Wheeler, who said the administration will finalize a new definition for which water bodies deserve federal protection within a matter of months, said the agency is seeking to end any lingering uncertainty and return more oversight to individual states. "We want to make sure that we have a definition that once and for all will be the law of the land in all 50 states," Wheeler said. But critics say the rollback will speed the conversion of wetlands and headwaters, which provide critical habitat for wildlife and support the nation's drinking water supply. Americans drained about half of the 220 million acres of wetlands in the contiguous United States between the 1780s and 1980s, most of it to expand farmland. That rate began to slow after George H.W. Bush took the White House, pledging to stem the tide of wetlands loss. "The administration wants to go back to an era where we are destroying wetlands heedlessly," Robert Irvin, president of American Rivers, said of President Donald Trump's latest deregulatory effort. The 2015 rule gave the federal government authority to oversee a wide array of lakes, streams, wetlands, storm-water controls and ditches that feed into larger waterways that are clearly protected under the 1972 Clean Water Act. Denise Stranko, federal legislative and policy manager for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, noted that all but one of the six states in the bay's watershed, along with the District of Columbia, operate under the Obama-era standard. She added that once the administration finalizes its substitute proposal, tens of thousands of acres that connect underground or through ditches to nearby waterways will lose protection. Targeting the Obama-era regulation ranked among Trump's top priorities when he took office. In February 2017, he issued an executive order directing the EPA to review the regulation in an effort to pave the way for what Trump called "the elimination of this very destructive and horrible rule." The Clean Water Act makes it unlawful to pollute a "water of the United States" without a permit, but what constitutes such water has been the subject of lengthy litigation. In a 2006 decision, Rapanos v. United States, the Supreme Court's four most conservative justices at the time offered a constrained view that only "navigable waters" met this test. But Justice Anthony Kennedy, who refused to join either the conservatives or the liberals, said that the government could intervene when there was a "significant nexus" between large water bodies and smaller ones. Trump's executive order said federal officials should rely on the opinion of Justice Antonin Scalia, who argued that the law should apply only to "navigable waters." Wheeler is slated to announce the final repeal of the 2015 rule at the National Association of Manufacturers, whose members had pushed to scale it back. "America is now one step closer to smart and balanced regulation that protects our nation's precious water resources," the group's president, Jay Timmons, said in a statement. Thursday's move is part of a broader effort by the administration to roll back regulations affecting the private sector by the end of Trump's first term. Among the dozens already reversed: easing rules on practices such as curbing methane emissions from drilling operations and holding oil and gas companies responsible for killing birds that get ensnared in their rigs' waste pits. "We will finalize all of our top priorities," Wheeler said. Several of the administration's early wins came through the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to nullify any rule within 60 days of enactment. The Republican-controlled Congress in 2017 was able to overturn several of President Barack Obama's last environmental acts that way, sending the bills to Trump for his signature. But reversing older regulations, such as the Clean Water Rule, has proved more difficult. Wheeler said it was taking longer than first anticipated to finalize the administration's new standards because staffers were conducting economic and scientific research to bolster the case for shrinking the federal government's authority over wetlands and streams. "I'm not in a rush to meet artificial deadlines," he said. "I want to make sure that our regulations are grounded, that they have all the supporting information they need to be upheld by the courts." Irvin said his group was prepared to take the EPA to court over its latest rollback. "Clearly the administration is intent on rolling back as many protections as it can before January of 2021," he said. "Like any rushed efforts, they are likely to make mistakes that will be challenged and overturned in court." Supporters of the administration, however, are eager for the change. On a recent evening in Hugo, Minnesota, Fran Miron looked out over the 800-acre farm that his family has maintained for four generations and explained why he welcomes the Trump administration's latest rollback. He said the Obama rule led to widespread confusion, as well as worries about increasing costs and red tape. "In my opinion, and I think it's shared by many, this was really just a power grab," said Miron, 65, whose family milks 120 cows and grows corn, soybeans and alfalfa. A former mayor of Hugo, Miron said he believes that the federal government doesn't always know what's best for a particular place. "The best decisions are made locally because the local people understand the nature of the issues," he said. "They understand the nuances of the land and our water."

Illinois' coal-fired power plants must cut mercury emissions 90 percent by 2009, Toxic pollution in Connecticut and New England has dropped significantly over the last 10 years, according to new numbers released by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA on Tuesday said land, air and water pollution in New England fell by 50 percent between 2007 and 2017 — and by 57 percent in Connecticut. “Across the six New England states, the data show many positive trends for reductions in toxic chemical releases,” said Deb Szaro, EPA New England Acting Regional Administrator. While the overall reduction in pollution is impressive, town-by-town comparisons in Connecticut show toxins decreased in some communities and rose in others. Chemicals discharged into Bridgeport’s air decreased by 90 percent over the decade while air pollution in Danbury increased by 23 percent, for example. Szaro focused on the positive. “A robust economy and sound environmental policies can achieve measurable results for better public health protections,” Szaro said, adding environmental regulation and economic growth can work together.

Deregulation The period analyzed by EPA includes eight years of activist environmental regulation during former President Barack Obama’s tenure. Since the election of President Donald Trump two years ago, federal air and water regulations have been weakened, most notably in coal-producing regions. Asked if the proposed regulation rollbacks will affect the future discharge of pollution, EPA Spokesman John Senn said the agency expects to see continuing improvement. “We anticipate continuing to see positive performance with continued implementation of environmental regulations combined with the trends we’ve seen in 2017 of environmental stewardship practiced by companies across industrial sectors,” Senn said. A spokesman for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection declined comment on the EPA’s numbers. Privately, state sources said EPA’s release of the pollution data was a public relations ploy by a federal agency under fire for weakening environmental protections. Connecticut has sued the EPA over failure to enforce air pollution regulations on Midwestern factories, claiming that pollution drifts into the state on the prevailing wind. The state opposes Trump administration proposals to scale back auto emission standards and air and water regulations enacted by Obama. Varying success Town-by-town comparisons in Connecticut for toxins show the pollution numbers vary year to year, with some years higher than others. Senn said the numbers change from town to town because each community has different facilities that emit pollution. ”If there are only a few facilities, air pollution changes from one facility can have significant changes for an entire community,” Senn said. Since 2007, EPA said air pollution releases fell 57 percent at industrial facilities submitting data to the agency. Industrial facilities reported implementing nearly 4,000 new source reduction activities that eliminated or reduced chemical waste, EPA said. McMillan said projects which update wastewater plants or put scrubbers on smokestacks also create jobs. “To realize that cycle of improvement, though, we need to maintain strong environmental regulation,” McMillan said.

Illinois' coal-fired power plants must cut mercury emissions 90 percent by 2009, Toxic pollution in Connecticut and New England has dropped significantly over the last 10 years, according to new numbers released by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA on Tuesday said land, air and water pollution in New England fell by 50 percent between 2007 and 2017 — and by 57 percent in Connecticut. “Across the six New England states, the data show many positive trends for reductions in toxic chemical releases,” said Deb Szaro, EPA New England Acting Regional Administrator. While the overall reduction in pollution is impressive, town-by-town comparisons in Connecticut show toxins decreased in some communities and rose in others. Chemicals discharged into Bridgeport’s air decreased by 90 percent over the decade while air pollution in Danbury increased by 23 percent, for example. Szaro focused on the positive. “A robust economy and sound environmental policies can achieve measurable results for better public health protections,” Szaro said, adding environmental regulation and economic growth can work together. While economic growth and a clean environment can occur at the same time, the EPA is rolling back needed regulations, said Laura McMillan, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment. “The current federal administration has repeatedly rolled back environmental protections, loosened enforcement and threatened critical funding” McMillan said. “Weakening these safeguards could damage our natural resources in ways that would take many, many years and taxpayer dollars to recover from,” she said. Deregulation The period analyzed by EPA includes eight years of activist environmental regulation during former President Barack Obama’s tenure. Since the election of President Donald Trump two years ago, federal air and water regulations have been weakened, most notably in coal-producing regions. Asked if the proposed regulation rollbacks will affect the future discharge of pollution, EPA Spokesman John Senn said the agency expects to see continuing improvement. “We anticipate continuing to see positive performance with continued implementation of environmental regulations combined with the trends we’ve seen in 2017 of environmental stewardship practiced by companies across industrial sectors,” Senn said. A spokesman for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection declined comment on the EPA’s numbers. Privately, state sources said EPA’s release of the pollution data was a public relations ploy by a federal agency under fire for weakening environmental protections. Connecticut has sued the EPA over failure to enforce air pollution regulations on Midwestern factories, claiming that pollution drifts into the state on the prevailing wind. The state opposes Trump administration proposals to scale back auto emission standards and air and water regulations enacted by Obama. Varying success Town-by-town comparisons in Connecticut for toxins show the pollution numbers vary year to year, with some years higher than others. Senn said the numbers change from town to town because each community has different facilities that emit pollution. ”If there are only a few facilities, air pollution changes from one facility can have significant changes for an entire community,” Senn said. Since 2007, EPA said air pollution releases fell 57 percent at industrial facilities submitting data to the agency.

 Wesley Reynolds, For the Daily News Pictured are early electrical lines in Midland. (Photo provided/Wesley Reynolds) Pictured are early electrical lines in Midland. (Photo provided/Wesley Reynolds) Caption Close Pictured are early electrical lines in Midland. (Photo provided/Wesley Reynolds) Pictured are early electrical lines in Midland. (Photo provided/Wesley Reynolds) Who would have expected that one very important wedding in 1892 would lead to Midland city having its first electrical lighting contract long before most Midwestern cities were even thinking of electricity as a way of life? Soon after Herbert H. Dow moved to Midland in 1890, he met and asked to marry a local school teacher, Grace A. Ball. The date was set for Nov. 16, 1892. The Midland Sun announced the wedding with great pomp, focusing on the Ball family over Dow, as he was a relative newcomer and considered a "mad capped" inventor, whereas the Balls were one of Midland's finest families. Not to be outdone by the Sun’s coverage of the lavish wedding, its rival newspaper the Midland Republican — perhaps recognizing that Dow's wizardry might usher in a new, modern way of life – announced the wedding, but decided to run a story on Dow’s never-before-seen bromide process. Dow immediately seized on the opportunity to dazzle his spectators with a color, sound, and lights show. This was his chance, and he pulled back the curtain with all the flare of master magician. The Republican exclaimed: “When approaching the buildings one is struck with the brilliancy of the light that issues from windows and upon entering the whole building is found to be lighter by electricity.” This mechanical marvel included an engine room which housed the city’s most powerful steam engine with 200 horse power. A seven-ton drive wheel 14 feet across and a single large belt transferred what the Republican reporter called the “electrical excitement” of the power unit to the entire factory. The the heart of the factory transforming kinetic energy into electric energy was called a “dynamo.” For Midlanders, it was amazing to conceive of such a powerful force conveyed through small strands of copper wire, but the dynamo itself was large enough. It weighed about 12 tons and produced 50,000 volt amperes. An ashy lye pooled in vat upon vat of unrecognizable mixtures; boiling cauldrons of chemical alchemy. The plant ran 13 hours per day, was manned by only 12 men, and total $100,000 in capital. “Everything is of the finest make and therefore the most economical,” quipped the Republican. But the press wanted more. They clamored for electrical power for the whole city because they thought electricity should not be the power behind one industry alone, but rather should in some way become the energy of the people. It would signal a new era in the extension of human will over the environment, forever dispelling the darkness of past ages. “Midland then would be ‘in it,’” the reporter said. At the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893, an entire nation saw the promise of electric light. Nights at the fair were illuminated with Westinghouse’s electric light bulbs and generator. The “White City,” built to imitate the architectural glories of Rome, gleamed with the incandescent hew of a burning filament which would become the definition of synthetic light for over a century. Millions went to the Fair, and all those from Midland who could afford the trip headed southwest. The list included Midland’s finest citizens: storeowners Mr. and Mrs. William Reardon, Mrs. G. W. Abbey of Abbey’s Jewelry, Mr. Herb Sias from one of Midland’s oldest pioneer families, Mrs. Max Anderson, wife of the banker, and her daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Dow, the Hon. J. W. Cochrane and son, and Mr. D. P. Waldo's daughter. The Fair’s practical attractions appealed to both businessmen and housewives. Among the marvelous gardens, astounding machines, climbing towers, and glistening fountains, Midlanders glimpsed their future as Americans. Dow hurried back from the Fair and installed yet another dynamo in his factory. In February 1894, Alderman Gordon appointed a committee to investigate the potential of lighting Main Street. The City Council saw to all the preparations and the date was set for May. Operations commenced in March. One workman even boasted that they could finish by the middle of April, but that was overstating the case. Dynamos sat out in the open until a power house could be constructed. Poles and wires were set up without either destinations or sources of power. Who would be first to be lit up? Bradley’s furniture factory on Ashman Street hosted the new electric works. From there, three wires were hung above Main Street and more than eight miles of wire were bought by the highest bidder. And wire was not cheap. It cost $100 per mile which amounts to $2,941.18 today! Many Midland businesses continued to favor gas for a few more years. Then the illuminations began. After adjusting the “arc light” fixtures, the workmen finally unveiled the light. Dozens of little blazing stars appeared over the street, rolling back the darkness. Then someone thought up a fun way of celebrating. The townsfolk hung Chinese lanterns to throw the marvelous incandescent yellow into a thousand shades of color. It was as if something Jules Verne had imagined had come to Midland, and the magic lights were far more glorious than anyone had imagined. The pioneering era had been extinguished with the lighting of modern life. All were not satisfied, however, as light pollution became a sudden reality. Many questioned the morality of a city with its own nightlife. Others worried that electric light would increase the pace of life in general. The city had forever cast the cold, desolate darkness of Michigan’s endless stump-country behind her. “Insomnia is fearfully on the increase,” ran an advertisement in the Republican. “The rush and excitement of modern life so tax the nervous system that multitudes of people are deprived of good and sufficient sleep, with ruinous consequences to the nerves.” Was man doomed now to a stream of constant urban activity? Would he never again return to the Paradise of “still waters” which “restore the soul?” Time would tell. Wesley Reynolds is a volunteer with the Midland County Historical Society.

 Dan Freedman Caption Close Washington Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Wednesday will introduce legislation to force the Environmental Protection Agency to set maximum levels for the class of chemicals involved in drinking-water contamination in Hoosick Falls and other sites in New York. The measure would require the EPA to set maximum levels for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS for short. The EPA would have two years to do it. In February, the EPA issued what its top official termed an "all-encompassing plan" on PFAS but sidestepped setting maximum levels. The agency, which under President Donald Trump has been in the forefront of rolling back pollution regulations, promised to look into setting new levels. Currently there is no maximum established for PFAS, but the EPA has established a health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) in drinking water. Gillibrand's bill, co-authored with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., reflects the skepticism of health and environmental advocates who say they doubt the EPA will buck the chemical industry's lobbyists. "It is the EPA's job to protect Americans from highly toxic chemicals like PFAS, but they have failed to do what is necessary to help ensure our families in New York and across the country are no longer exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS in their drinking water," Gillibrand said in a statement. "This is a widespread crisis that is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk." Gillibrand has been alternating periods of legislative activity on Capitol Hill with appearances on the campaign trail in her bid to become the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. Toxic levels of a variety of PFAS were found in the drinking water in Hoosick Falls in 2014, the result of filtration from a nearby plant producing chemicals for nonstick plastics in cookware and other products. The levels discovered in Hoosick Falls in 2014 ranged from 180 ppt to 540 ppt. Health and environmental experts and advocates say the advisory level of 70 ppt is too high. In December, the New York Drinking Water Quality Council recommended a "maximum contaminant level" of 10 parts per billion for the two PFAS chemicals found in water in Hoosick Falls, Petersburgh, Newburgh and elsewhere in the state. They are PFOA — perfluorooctanoic acid — and PFOS — perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. But the recommendation has not officially been adopted by the state Department of Health. If it were in force, it would be the most stringent state standard in the nation. The chemical industry has gradually withdrawn PFAS from the market, putting in place substitutes like GenX. But advocates have pointed to studies casting doubt on industry claims that GenX and other chemicals like it are much of an improvement. The industry generally has been supportive of efforts to fight contamination, including specific ceilings for PFAS. But they warn against what they see as overkill. "The weight of scientific evidence does not support some of the proposed policies that are currently under consideration," said John Banovetz, a senior vice president at 3M Corp. "In fact, no public health agency in the world has found that PFAS cause harm to human health at past or current exposure levels." He added: "Legislatively dictated, predetermined outcomes that don't follow the science would undermine the integrity of the regulatory process going forward." The discovery of toxins in drinking water turned Hoosick Falls into a ground zero of sorts for chemical pollution in water. PFAS do not dissipate once they infiltrate ground water. Studies have linked the chemicals to kidney, breast and testicular cancer. The EPA designated parts of the village as Superfund cleanup sites, and its drinking water is now filtered by equipment supplied by the plastics manufacturer blamed for causing the pollution, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, a multinational corporation based in France. The village of Hoosick Falls has been involved in legal action against Saint-Gobain and Honeywell International, another operator of a factory in the area. Gillibrand and Capito are both members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which will hold a legislative hearing on chemical pollution next Wednesday. In addition, the House Energy & Commerce subcommittee on environment and climate change, chaired by Rep. Paul Tonko, D-Amsterdam, will hold a hearing Wednesday on 13 House bills also aimed at reining in PFAS pollution. Among them is one authored by freshman Rep. Antonio Delgado, D-Rhinebeck, which would require EPA public reporting of PFAS releases. Among the witnesses testifying will be Emily Marpe, a mother and community member from Petersburgh.

 By Brian Nearing Caption Close Watervliet A military contractor at the Watervliet Arsenal is paying a $50,000 fine for failing to properly maintain air pollution control equipment, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Hartchrom Inc., a chrome plating company that lines cannon tubes for the U.S. Army, also agreed to improve its inspection and record-keeping for equipment used to control pollution from its chroming process. During two visits to the Building 35 facility in early August 2018, state inspectors found that Hartchrom workers were failing to inspect the pollution control equipment for cracks or leaks. The inspectors then discovered cracks in equipment meant to remove chromium, a toxic, carcinogenic heavy metal. If Hartchrom fixes the issues, DEC agreed to suspend an additional $10,000 fine, according to an agreement signed by DEC and Hartchrom last month. Calls to Hartchrom for comment Tuesday weren't returned. Calls to Michael Sterthous, an Albany-based lawyer for Hartchrom, which has been at the arsenal since 2002, for comment also weren't returned. In March 2017, the Swiss-based company was awarded a $17 million contract from the U.S. Army to perform chrome-plating and surfacing operations for cannon barrels on 120 millimeter and 155 millimeter cannon. According to a DEC statement, the agency has "no evidence of Hartchrom violating emission standards." When pollution equipment was tested by state inspectors in October 2015, it was found to be operating within acceptable limits, according to DEC. When the cracks were found in August 2018, the equipment was again found to be working properly. DEC indicated that Hartchrom was last cited by DEC in 2010 for violations that included beginning construction without a permit. In 2014, the company got into a dispute with arsenal managers over the company's attempted improper disposal of tainted production liquid at the facility's wastewater treatment plant. Arsenal officials stopped the company from dumping 39,000 gallons of tainted liquid, forcing Hartchrom to dispose of the liquid as hazardous waste. Afterward, Hartchrom tried to recoup what it claimed were more than $92,000 in disposal and lost revenue expenses from the U.S. Army. But last year, the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals denied the claim. Calls to arsenal officials for comment weren't returned. Last year, the Army took back management control of the arsenal from the not-for-profit Arsenal Business & Technology Partnership, which had brought in Hartchrom as a tenant.

That’s according to the American Lung Association “State of the Air 2019” report released Wednesday, April 24, 2019 that ranks metropolitan areas based on ozone and particle pollution during 2015, 2016 and 2017. When it comes to clean air, all eight Connecticut counties get an F with ozone pollution. That’s according to the American Lung Association “State of the Air 2019” report released Wednesday, April 24, When it comes to clean air, all eight Connecticut counties get an F for ozone pollution. In a report released Wednesday by the American Lung Association — “State of the Air 2019” — researchers ranked metropolitan areas based on ozone and particle pollution in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The 20th annual air quality report card tracks Americans’ exposure to unhealthful levels of ozone and particle pollution, both of which can be deadly. Connecticut’s worst air pollution ranking comes from ozone. The state is ranked 10th as the worst polluted with ozone. The ranking includes New York-Newark, N.J. and Pennsylvania. Often called smog, ozone pollution is harmful to breathe. Ozone aggressively attacks lung tissue by reacting chemically with it. When ozone is present, other harmful pollutants can be created. The methodology of the report determined a “weighted average” of ozone pollution based on the number of “orange” and “red” days. Orange days are when the air quality index is between 101 and 150, on days when temperatures are in the 80s and 90s and winds are light. Red days are when air quality index is between 151 and 200, on days that are hot, hazy and humid, the air is stagnant and skies are sunny with little chance of precipitation. Fairfield County had the highest number of high ozone days with an average of 25.8 days. It had 52 orange days and 17 red days. New Haven County was second with 15.7 days. It had 32 orange days and 10 red days. Middlesex County was third with 11.5 days. It had 30 orange days and three red days. New London County had an average of 10.7 days. It had 26 orange days and 4 red days. Hartford County was fifth with 6.2 days. It had 17 orange days and one red day. Litchfield County has a weighted average of 6.2 days. It had 13 orange days and one red day. Tolland County average was 4.7 days. It had 14 orange days and no red days. Windham County had the lowest average with 3.8 days. It had 10 orange days and no red days. California had the highest ozone pollution with seven of its cities in the Top 10. Connecticut gets a passing grade with particle pollution — a mix of ash, soot, diesel exhaust, chemicals, metals and aerosols. The microscopic particles can burrow deep within the lungs, triggering asthma, heart attacks, strokes and lung cancer. Although Connecticut has some of the toughest air pollution standards in the country, officials have said Connecticut is downwind of polluting power plants in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia that have failed to provide ozone-reduction plans. Connecticut joined New York and six other Northeastern states in suing the EPA over the enforcement of pollution from Midwestern power plants. The Trump administration has allowed nine states to exceed pollution limits. In February, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong filed the suit to force the Environmental Protection Agency to comply with federal law by requiring further controls on smog pollution. “Connecticut sits at the end of the tailpipe of the nation's exhaust fumes, with severe consequences for public health,” Tong said. “States like Connecticut ... downwind of some of our country's heaviest polluters need the protection of strong interstate ozone pollution regulation. Trump EPA’s failure to comply with the Clean Air Act violates federal law and endangers the health of Connecticut families.”

 By Brian Nearing Schenectady Toxic chemicals will be dug out of two vacant former dry cleaners sites in Schenectady and Watervliet, under plans announced by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The property around the former Admiral Cleaners, 617 19th St., Watervliet, and the former Kenwood Cleaners, 445 Duane Ave., Schenectady, are tainted with high levels of a carcinogenic dry cleaning solvent, tetrachloroethene (PCE), and related toxic byproducts. Exposure to PCE likely increases cancer risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Primary effects from chronic, long-term inhalation exposure are neurological, including impaired cognitive and motor neurobehavioral performance, according to EPA. PCE exposure may also "cause adverse effects in the kidney, liver, immune system and hematologic system, and on development and reproduction," according to the EPA. DEC plans to dig up and dispose of about 15 feet of PCE-tainted soil around the Admiral site and remove an underground storage tank, according to agency paperwork. The site closed in 2017, but had been a dry cleaners since 1950 before closing in 2013 due to environmental violations. After that, it was used as a drop-off shop for dry cleaning, where clothes were taken elsewhere to be cleaned. The $400,000 cost of the program would be paid for the by the state Superfund program, which covers the expense of cleanups when the person or company responsible for the pollution cannot pay or refuses to do so. A copy of the plan can be found in the office of the Watervliet city clerk at 2 Fifteenth St., Watervliet. At the former Kenwood site, about 20 feet of PCE-tainted soil will be removed and disposed of as part of a $1.1 million cleanup plan, according to DEC paperwork. It also will be paid for through the state Superfund program. The cleaners opened in 1950, and operated as late as the 1980s, according to DEC. PCE was found in both the ground and groundwater at levels well beyond state safety standards. PCE vapors were also found to be leaking out of the ground, including at one unspecified "off-site" location. A copy of the plan can be found at the Phyllis Bornt Branch Library, 948 State St., Schenectady.

 Seth Borenstein Associated Press Washington After several years of little growth, global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide experienced their largest jump in seven years, discouraging scientists. World carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to have risen 2.7 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to three studies released Wednesday from the Global Carbon Project, an international scientific collaboration of academics, governments and industry that tracks greenhouse gas emissions. The calculations, announced during negotiations to put the 2015 Paris climate accord into effect, puts some of the landmark agreement's goals nearly out of reach, scientists said. "This is terrible news," said Andrew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive, which models greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures but was not part of the research. "Every year that we delay serious climate action, the Paris goals become more difficult to meet." The studies concluded that this year the world would spew 40.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion tons last year. The margin of error is about one percentage point on either side. The Global Carbon Project uses government and industry reports to come up with final emission figures for 2017 and projections for 2018 based on the four biggest polluters: China, the United States, India and the European Union. The U.S., which had been steadily decreasing its carbon pollution, showed a significant rise in emissions — up 2.5 percent — for the first time since 2013. China, the globe's biggest carbon emitter, saw its largest increase since 2011: 4.6 percent. Study lead author Corinne Le Quere, a climate change researcher at the University of East Anglia in England, said she believes unusual factors are at play this year. For the U.S., it was a combination of a hot summer and cold winter that required more electricity use for heating and cooling. For China, it was an economic stimulus that pushed coal-powered manufacturing, Le Quere said. Use of coal — the biggest carbon emitter — is rising.

 By Chris Tomlinson, Staff writer Caption Close Not long ago, I questioned the conservatism of those who think personal liberty is best measured by access to thin-film plastic bags and single-use plastic straws. Today, I question the wisdom of condemning a whole class of materials. Environmental groups love publishing images of marine mammals suffering from plastic waste. We’ve all seen the plastic clogging at least one whale’s intestines. Researchers, meanwhile, have published reams of data showing how plastic-coating the planet will ruin our health. Since 1950, the world has dumped 14.3 trillion pounds of plastic waste on the planet, including landfills and oceans. The industry produces another 350 billion tons of resins and fibers every year, with industry estimates predicting the market will grow to 535 billion tons a year by 2035. On HoustonChronicle.com: Plastics industry promises to fight waste; trust but verify More than half of all plastic by weight is used only once before going to a landfill or the ocean, according to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal Science Advances. People will incinerate 8 percent of it, and 30 percent of plastic is for long-term use. Only 7 percent is recycled, but only once, before it goes to a landfill. Whether a plastic water bottle ends up littering the planet or in a landfill, though, depends strictly on where it’s consumed. Most marine plastic waste comes from Asia, and overwhelmingly from China, India and Thailand. More than 86 percent of the plastic found in the ocean was dumped first in either an Asian or African river and flowed to the sea. “We all know that plastics should never end up as garbage, particularly not ending up in the ocean,” Patty Long, interim CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, told the Global Plastics Summit, organized by research and data firm IHS Markit. “It’s been pretty uncomfortable over the last six months to a year as we’ve watched images of plastics streaming over beaches, and pictures of sea animals who have ingested plastics,” she added. “There are people looking for quick fixes and easy solutions, but if you’ve spent any amount of time working in this industry, you know there are no silver bullets.” Plastics play an essential role in solving our other global problem: climate change. Plastics make things lighter, which means they require less energy. Plastics can seal buildings and coat windows to provide insulation and save on climate control. Some plastic items should be banned, but most improve our lives. They need to be recycled. Public support for recycling is so strong that half of consumers said they would pay more for sustainable products designed to be reused or recycled, according to a survey from Accenture, the consulting firm. But 72 percent of the respondents from 11 countries perceived plastic as the least environmentally friendly type of packaging, presenting a severe challenge to the industry. Current plastics recycling programs are a financial and literal mess, producing unaffordable products or food-contaminated waste. Ever since China banned the importation of U.S. plastic waste, it has lost all monetary value. The plastics industry needs a system like the one for aluminum, which is efficient and makes collecting cans financially worthwhile. Most recycled plastic currently is mulched and has limited applications. What the industry needs is a chemical system that turns plastic back into a resin that can be used as feedstock for making more plastic products. Unfortunately, chemical recycling systems are mostly experimental, said Dewey Johnson, vice president for base chemicals and plastics at IHS Markit. “To go from where we are today, to have large commercial scale operations that have a global impact, is probably about a decade away,” Johnson predicted. On HoustonChronicle.com: The future may not be plastics after all The Plastics Industry Association is asking Congress to kick start the process by passing the RECOVER Act. The proposal would give federal grants to help develop advanced plastic recycling facilities. “Congress is starting to recognize that while this is really difficult right now in the short term, it does have some opportunities in terms of jobs, investment, wages and taxes,” Long said. If U.S. companies can make recycling plastic profitable, they can take that technology to Asia and pay people to stop throwing reusable resources in their rivers. Rewarding good behavior is always better than trying to punish bad. The root cause of plastic pollution is not what most people imagine. The solution is more complicated than they would prefer, and simple slogans will take us down the wrong path. Cleaning up the plastic pollution smothering the planet requires industry, consumers and government to compromise - not vilify one another.

Overall, the authority’s budget for 2019-2020 is planned for $18.6 million, with just under $16.5 million coming from Norwalk customers. “The Norwalk Water Pollution Control Authority, an enterprise fund, manages the City’s sanitary sewer collection system, pumping stations and wastewater treatment facility, in accordance with environmental standards and regulations in the most cost-effective and responsible manner,” Ralph Kolb, the senior environmental engineer wrote to the Board of Estimate and Taxation in a March letter. Kolb appeared before the Board in April so it could approve the upcoming year’s budget. Some of the drivers of the increased revenue include the fact that that authority’s 20-year wastewater treatment service agreement with OMI, Inc, will expire in May 2020. “In November 2018, we issued a request for proposals and the deadline for submission was March 15, 2019 in which we received 4 proposals,” Kolb told the board. “We’re currently engaged in the evaluation and interview process.” One of the bidders was OMI again, he said, but they have more work to do before selecting their next service provider. However, no matter who the contractor is, Kolb said he believes the price will go up. “We’re anticipating an increase in the annual fee,” he said. This year, the authority also has to purchase nitrogen credits for $90,000 instead of getting those back as additional revenue, Kolb said. The state launched the credit program in 2002 to reduce nitrogen discharged in Long Island Sound, but the wet 2018 caused them to have more than usual, Kolb said. Despite the exceptionally wet year, Kolb said they are not close to the capacity of the wastewater treatment facility, which can handle up to 18 million gallons a day. On average, the city produces 13-14 million gallons each day. The Board of Estimate and Taxation unanimously approved the authority’s proposed budget at its April meeting. kelly.kultys@hearstmediact.com

 By Kaitlin Bain Caption Close A coalition of residents is organizing to tell the state to stop allowing industrial plants to leach pollution into Southeast Texas. Several residents have raised concerns specifically about the levels of sulfur dioxide being released by Oxbow Calcining in Port Arthur. They’re also asking the state to step up lead monitoring in Southeast Texas. The group is planning to submit comments to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality during the annual comment period for input on the agency’s air quality monitoring techniques. The document that details the techniques provides information on the Texas network of ambient air quality monitors that were established to meet national ambient air quality standards, according to the agency. The agency is required to make the report available for public comment before it’s sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “TCEQ works for the public. These organizations exist to provide services to the people and work at our behest,” local activist and former U.S. Rep. Nick Lampson said. “If the citizens aren’t paying attention, then we deserve what we get. But when we participate and speak out, then I think these agencies have an obligation to fix the problem.” Lampson said he’s concerned about Oxbow because he believes the company has been allowed to circumvent the pollution-monitoring process. Oxbow’s Port Arthur calcining plant, on a 112-acre waterfront site near the Sabine Neches Ship Channel, uses petroleum coke, a byproduct from the oil refining process, to create calcined coke, which is then sold to make aluminum, titanium dioxide and other industrial products. The Beaumont Enterprise reported in April that a TCEQ ambient air quality monitor, the location of which was chosen based on Oxbow’s operations, has not been proven to be adequately monitoring sulfur dioxide emissions from the plant. >> Related: Emissions concerns arise over Port Arthur plant To participate in the comment period: The proposed 2019 plan can be viewed on the TCEQ’s website by visiting tceq.texas.gov, clicking air, air quality and monitoring and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 2019 Annual Monitoring Network Plan under the heading “Studies and Data.” Mail comments to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, P.O. Box 13087, Attention: Holly Landuyt, MC-165, Austin, Texas 78711-3087 Email comments to monops@tceq.texas.gov The comment period ends May 22. That’s because, after the monitor’s location was chosen, the plant began releasing all emissions at a much higher temperature than original testing took into account. Neil Carman, a former TCEQ investigator who is now the director of the Clean Air Program for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter, said with the additional heat, the emissions likely are going up and over the monitor and ending up concentrated in a different part of Port Arthur than original testing revealed. Oxbow spokesman Brad Goldstein in April said the company is in full compliance with its operating permits. “We are proud of our environmental record and continue to work proactively with TCEQ to operate within all applicable laws and permits,” he said in an email. But Port Arthur environmental activist Hilton Kelley said while the company may appear to be in compliance, TCEQ should take a more active role in investigating the issue. “That Seventh Street monitor isn’t doing a whole lot of good because it appears that a lot of the emissions coming from Oxbow aren’t hitting the monitor,” he said. “We have a large number of people with respiratory problems, asthma. I do believe it’s because of the disproportionate amount of sulfur from places like Oxbow,” he added. Kelley said he’s also concerned about the amount of lead coming from Oxbow and other plants, information he plans to include in his comments. TCEQ does not have any monitors in the Beaumont-Port Arthur area to pick up lead concentrations on its Ambient Air Monitoring Network Site List. Lampson, Kelley and others are urging residents to join them in sending comments to TCEQ. “I’m hoping people will understand this is adverse to them and say something,” Lampson said. “Go out and change our community so our future gets better.” The two men acknowledged that not everyone has the time or knowledge to gather extensive data about issues in the area. But that doesn’t have to stop residents from making comments, Kelley said. Lampson said residents can write a note saying they agree with other comments being made on an issue. Kelley suggested making comments personal, which sometimes can do more than straight numbers. “We already know Port Arthur is a hotbed for cancer. We know there’s a large amount of toxins being dumped in the air,” Kelley said. “They can talk about the impact of the emissions on family and friends. They can talk about the smell in the air. They can talk about how they feel inside their homes. They can talk about the number of times they’ve had to stay inside for a chemical release without knowing what’s going on. All these things point to the issues we’re having without needing data.” kaitlin.bain@beaumontenterprise.com twitter.com/KaitlinBain Kaitlin Bain is the Government Reporter for the Beaumont Enterprise.

 MNA Staff Caption Close From the Lansing State Journal LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Scientists want to use an unconventional method to remove pollution at former General Motors properties near Lansing where an underground plume of chemicals is creeping toward drinking water wells. The Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust controls the former GM plants. It is proposing a remediation method called "biosparging," which removes pollution by injecting air into groundwater. The method encourages bacteria to consume 1,4-dioxane, an industrial chemical that GM used to clean oil off car parts. Should the trust gain state approval, the project would be among the first and likely the largest to use the method, the Lansing State Journal reported . It's unclear how much the project would cost, but engineers said it could take six to 12 years to fully clean the water. The pollution was discovered after the trust was established by the federal government to take over the GM sites following the company's bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. The dioxane plume is located under two former GM plants in Lansing Township and Lansing. Dave Favero, deputy cleanup manager for the Michigan properties, said dioxane is very soluble. If dioxane is in oil, as it was used at the GM plants, "it leaches out and starts to migrate with the groundwater," he said. Long-term exposure could lead to liver, kidney and reproductive problems and possibly cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Lansing-area plume is within the Lansing Board of Water and Light's wellhead protection area for some of its drinking water wells. Up to 10 of the utility's wells are downstream from the polluted groundwater. The utility started monitoring for dioxane in 2015, and found a small amount within the limits of what the EPA considers safe. The utility hasn't monitored dioxane levels that exceed the EPA's safe limit yet. The trust will need to get approval from state environmental regulators. Scientists and engineers could begin installing biosparging wells this year if the plan is approved.

 By Brian Nearing Troy Petroleum giant Chevron could pay about $1.8 million to clean up a former industrial site in South Troy once used to make manufactured coal gas and later to store asphalt, according to a plan being considered by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Work at the 7-acre Water Street property, located just south of the Route 378 (Menands) bridge, should start next year and last about nine months, according to a DEC notice this week. Storage tanks on the site were removed in 2006 and the site is currently vacant. California-based Chevron USA Inc. would pay to remove about 725 cubic yards of soil contaminated with nearly a dozen industrial chemicals, tar and asphalt left behind when the site closed in 1999 after at least seven decades of industrial use, first for plants that manufactured coal coke and gas, and then for asphalt storage and distribution. The ground is now polluted with aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzopyrene, benzoanthracene, benzene, toluene, arsenic and xylene. Tests have found coal tar as far as 11 feet underground. Once the contaminated soil is removed, the cleanup plan calls for the site to be covered with soil "acceptable for commercial and industrial land use," according to DEC. The land has been filled in with "slag, cinders, brick, gravel and other materials" over the past, according to DEC. DEC will hold a public hearing on the proposal at 7 p.m. Feb. 20 at Troy City Hall, 433 River St., and is taking public comments on the plan Feb. 1 through March 2, through John Spellman, project manager, NYSDEC, Division of Environmental Remediation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233, or john.spellman@dec.ny.gov. A copy of the proposal is available for public inspection at the Troy Public Library, 100 Second St., Troy.

 Kyunghee Park, Bloomberg Caption Close The world's biggest shipbuilder sees China's cleanup of its smoggy skies lifting prices of the vessels this year. As China prioritizes dealing with the smog that has famously blanketed Beijing and other big cities, the world's second-biggest economy is increasingly turning to liquefied natural gas as a replacement for coal for heating and other purposes, boosting imports of the cleaner fuel. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. expects orders for carriers of the gas to lead demand for new ships, Chief Executive Officer Sam H. Ka said. "China's need for LNG appears to have triggered the restart of some gas projects in the U.S., Australia and Qatar," Ka said in a phone interview from Seoul. "Our slots for LNG-carrier construction are pretty much filled up until 2021." Surging demand for LNG in China, as well as in smaller emerging economies, has spurred energy explorers including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA to focus on investments in gas development projects. The accompanying demand for carriers to transport the fuel is a bright spot for a shipbuilding industry that has struggled to win orders since crude oil prices slumped in 2014. Qatar plans to order about 60 new LNG carriers, adding to the 50 it already owns, according to Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al Kaabi. Shares of Hyundai Heavy rose 0.7 percent in Seoul to 143,500 won Tuesday, the highest closing price since March 28. That compares with a 0.3 percent gain in South Korea's benchmark Kospi index. Hyundai's rivals Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. and Samsung Heavy Industries Co. also advanced. Ka expects the rising demand to benefit the world's top three shipyards, which are all based in South Korea. Gas carriers are the most expensive commercial ships and take the longest time to build. "This is a good start to the new year with clear signs of strong demand for LNG carriers," said Um Kyung-a, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in Seoul. "As more and more slots get filled with LNG-carrier orders, it's going to enable shipyards to raise prices for all types of vessels." Hyundai Heavy, Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., together with other smaller South Korean shipyards, won 94 percent of the 80 LNG carriers ordered worldwide last year, according to the country's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. The companies also accounted for 87 percent of Very Large Crude Carriers ordered globally. These helped increase their order backlog by 25 percent last year and will allow them to raise prices for vessels, Ka said on Jan. 24. The executive predicted that average prices for ships built by Hyundai Heavy and its rivals could climb 10 percent this year following a 10 percent increase in 2018. Samsung Heavy received an order from Celsius Tankers in Europe to build two 180,000-cubic-meter LNG carriers for about $375 million, the Seongnam-based shipbuilder said in an email Tuesday. The latest orders planned by Qatar, announced Monday at a Qatar-South Korea summit, comes more than a decade after the Middle Eastern nation's last major LNG-carrier contracts for Korean shipyards. In the three years through 2007, the world's three biggest shipbuilders won orders from Qatar to build more than 40 LNG carriers. Ka expects the global shipbuilding industry to continue on a gradual recovery over the next few years. Orders could exceed 60 million gross tons, which measures the volume of space in a ship, rising from a little more than 55 million tons estimated for last year. Hyundai Heavy could report better earnings for 2019, helped by prices of steel plates that are expected to stagnate or rise moderately this year, Ka said. Prices of the material, used to make the hull of ships, rose more than 30 percent last year, contributing to a nine-month net loss of 274.8 billion won at the company, which is scheduled to report full-year results this week.

 By Marissa Luck Caption Close Exxon Mobil, under pressure from shareholders, has agreed to report plastic pellet spills from its polymer production plants to prevent ocean pollution, according to a shareholder group that focuses on corporate responsibility. The shareholder group, As You Sow, filed a proposed shareholder resolution in January with several major petrochemical producers, including Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical, Phillips 66 and Chevron, asking for annual reporting on spills and measures taken to prevent and clean up spills. Exxon appears to be the first company to succumb to the pressure. Under a deal struck with As You Sow, Exxon will begin providing details about whether any spills occurred, specifics about how it is monitoring for spills and how it is managing pellets. It will also describe how the company assesses the effectiveness of pellet loss prevention measures. The company apparently did not have any spills though in 2018, according to As You Sow. As a result of the agreement, As You Sow withdrew its shareholder proposal, according to SEC documents. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond what was said in the SEC documents acknowledging the withdrawal of the shareholder proposal. RELATED: Reporter’s Notebook: Can chemistry fix the plastic waste problem? "We are pleased that Exxon Mobil has agreed to do public reporting on plastic pellet spills and management," said Conrad MacKerron, senior vice president at As You Sow in a statement. "It is important for all industry players to establish similar transparency so stakeholders can get a realistic view of the size and scope of this problem. We hope the other companies we are engaged with will follow its lead. 260 species affected Exxon's petrochemical division has several plants that produce plastic pellets, called nurdles, which are used to produce thousands of everyday plastic products. These tiny plastic pellets, which can be spilled during handling and transportation and swept into waterways, are estimated to be the second largest direct source of microplastic pollution to the ocean by weight. The tiny pellets, the size of fish eggs, make their way onto shorelines, beaches and break up into smaller pieces that animals can mistake as food. Plastic pollution affects 260 species, causing fatalities from ingestion, entanglement, suffocation and drowning, according to As You Sow. Exxon Mobil is the first major petrochemical producer to agree to report information on plastic pellet spills publicly to shareholders, said Jane Patton, coordinator based in New Orleans with the anti-plastic pollution advocacy movement Break Free From Plastic. "This is significant and huge," Patton said. "I'm glad they're willing to disclose this, but there is a lot more that Exxon needs to be doing to mitigate harm to local communities" that comes as a result of air and waste pollution from petrochemical plants." Many petrochemical companies are involved in a program called Operation Clean Sweep that aims to promote best practices for pellet management and containment to prevent pellet spills.But As You Sow has criticized the group because it doesn't require companies to publicly report spills or plastic management methods. TEAMING UP: LyondellBasell, Dow chiefs call on industry to fix plastic waste problem The other shareholder proposals filed with Chevron, Phillips 66 and Dow Chemical will likely be voted on during shareholder meetings this spring. Taking responsibility As You Sow last year was involved in successful efforts to push Starbucks to ditch plastic straws and pressure KraftHeinz, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and others to commit to increase the use of recycled packaging in their products. Chuck Venezia, senior vice president of petrochemicals at the analyst and research firm Argus Media, said petrochemical companies typically have redundant systems to prevent spills because it's in their best economic interest to avoid losing the product. The issue of plastic pellet spills has not been a major focus area yet for the industry, but he noted that the industry is starting to take more responsibility for reducing plastic waste through better waste management systems, community education and recycling initiatives. "There are so many benefits to plastics that are not getting reported – but just like everything else they need to be handled and treated properly," Venezia said. Ashish Chitalia, polyolefin analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the industry is responding broader backlash against single-use plastics with initiatives such as the nonprofit the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. "We expect to see broader participation in reporting the plastic pellet losses, as doing so may enable companies to improve their economics, standard handling procedure and their sustainability goals," Chitalia said.

 Stephen J. Bronner Caption Close Pizza was just the first step to saving the world, according to Zume co-founder and CEO Alex Garden. The company, makers of a robot-powered truck that cooks pizzas en route to customers, today announced it is making a major pivot to manufacturing compostable food containers. The world, particularly the oceans, are choking on plastic. Ocean Conservancy estimates that every year "8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments." In a stretch of the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and California, there's a mass of plastic and other trash that's about three times the size of Texas. Some of this plastic will take hundreds of years to break down. Much of this pollution -- 300 million tons globally a year -- comes from our addiction to single use plastics, such as bags, tableware and takeout containers. To get a grasp of this worsening problem, you need not look further than China. A recent New York Times story illustrated that just through food delivery apps, the large country generated 1.6 million tons of waste in 2017 -- including "1.2 million tons of plastic containers, 175,000 tons of disposable chopsticks, 164,000 tons of plastic bags and 44,000 tons of plastic spoons" -- a ninefold increase from 2015. Related: Why This Company That Relies on Automation Talks Openly About the Future of Work The answer isn't recycling; only 9 percent of all plastic waste ever produced has been recycled, according to the U.N. The only solution now is to not make the plastic problem worse. That's what Zume hopes to do. The four-year-old company has acquired Pivot Packaging, which co-created Zume's signature compostable Pizza Pod. The combined company, now called Zume Packaging, opened a 70,000 square foot manufacturing plant in southern California. There, it will use a proprietary process to turn materials such as bagasse (sugarcane fiber), bamboo, wheat, straw, and other organic fibers (some of which were bound for landfills) into cups, bowls, plates, utensils and serving trays. Garden said these items break down in 90 days. Two more plants, another in the U.S. and one overseas, are planned as well. The company has set an ambitious goal of replacing 1 billion plastic and styrofoam food containers by 2020. Its customers, which the company says it can't divulge, include a large airline, a $5 billion U.S. foodservice brand and a food conglomerate. "What Zume Pizza really was and still is today is a testing ground for this incredible suite of technologies, which we're beginning to announce today," Garden told Entrepreneur. "Zume is the first attempt to reboot the [packaging] supply chain and to give companies big and small around the world technologies that radically improve their sustainability and improve their margins at the same time. There's no limit to what this technology can create. There's some material science limits, but expect everything that's currently food related, single use plastic to be in scope for us." Related: How Food Entrepreneurs Are Saving the Planet, According to the CEO of Tofurky The cost equation is vital to making any progress with the fight against plastic. After all, businesses only use them because they're so cheap. Garden said Zume's compostable solutions will be at or below the cost of competing products. "When we first started making [the Pizza Pod], it was about $2 a package, which is ridiculous," he said. "We were able to engineer it down to 68 cents a package, which is better, but still far too expensive. As we went further down the road on packaging, we realized there was a huge opportunity. That's why we bought Pivot. We don't want restaurants to have to make tough compromises between profitability and sustainability." He pointed out that Zume also has an advantage as more countries, including most recently Canada, ban single use plastics. The move into packaging is only part of the business expansion for Zume, which holds more than 1,700 patents. Pizza will now fall under Zume Culinary, which will create solutions for food delivery services. Zume Forward will aim to help food companies "predict demand and deploy food and goods where people want them," according to the company. Finally, Zume Source will offer alternatives "for how food is grown, transported, prepared and packaged." Related: Hemp Could Be the Solution to Our Plastic Pollution Crisis But Garden, who previously served as the former president of Zynga and general manager of Xbox Live, said pizza serves as the foundation for his company. "It's pretty disingenuous to try to sell technology into the food industry if you're not a food company," he said. "So we knew that we had to earn the right to have a point of view, and there's no better way to do that than to serve customers safely with craveable food and really demonstrate that you understand what goes into that service."

Firefighters arrive at the site where the Intercontinental Terminals Company petrochemical fire reignited as crews tried to clean out the chemicals that remained in the tanks Friday, March 22, 2019, in Deer Caption Close Firefighters arrive at the site where the Intercontinental Terminals Company petrochemical fire reignited as crews tried to clean out the chemicals that remained in the tanks Friday, March 22, 2019, in Deer Park, Texas. Firefighters arrive at the site where the Intercontinental Terminals Company petrochemical fire reignited as crews tried to clean out the chemicals that remained in the tanks Friday, March 22, 2019, in Deer AUSTIN — Attorney General Ken Paxton, on behalf of the state’s top regulatory agency, filed suit Friday against the company responsible for the Deer Park fire, alleging it released pollution in violation of the Texas Clean Air Act. In the 18-page suit filed in a Travis County district court, Paxton seeks a citation and civil penalties against Intercontinental Terminals Company, the liquid storage terminal company whose facility caused a series of fires this week, for violations of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality rules. The violations include unauthorized air pollution, outdoor burning and visible emissions. Paxton also seeks an injunction to force the company to comply with the law. “The state of Texas works hard to maintain good air quality and will hold ITC accountable for the damage it has done to our environment,” Paxton said in a statement. “ITC has a history of environmental violations, and this latest incident is especially disturbing and frightening. No company can be allowed to disrupt lives and put public health and safety at risk.” For subscribers: Latest fire contained at charred Deer Park plant The TCEQ continues to monitor the air quality in the affected areas about 20 miles east of Houston. The federal Chemical Safety Board, which investigates serious chemical accidents, announced Thursday that it is opening an investigation into the ITC fire. “I would like to thank the Attorney General for acting so quickly on TCEQ’s request to enforce against ICT, LLC,” the environmental agency’s Executive Director Toby Baker said in a statement. So far, Baker said, only air quality violations have been cited in the suit “due to the dynamic, ongoing investigation.” Additional violations, including water quality, will be referred to the Attorney General as part of the action, he said.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By oht_editor | on August 11, 2019 REP. PAUL MITCHELL Editor’s note: Congressman Paul Mitchell, R-Dryden Township recently sent the letter below to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer regarding a proposed gravel mine on the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property in Metamora Township, which is adjacent to the Metamora Landfill Superfund site. Mitchell represents the 10th Congressional District that includes Lapeer County. Dear Gov. Whitmer, I write to express serious concerns about a proposed gravel mine on the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property in Metamora Township. This property is adjacent to the Metamora Landfill Superfund site (“site”) and the impacts this project could have on the local community and groundwater are severe. This issue was initially brought to my attention by my constituents and local stakeholders. At issue is the status of monitoring wells that track the extent and movement of contaminated groundwater emanating from the site, which is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Through multiple discussions and letters expressing these concerns to the EPA, I learned that the responsible parties had not fully complied with a July 2015 order to expand the monitoring wells around the landfill. It is troubling there is not yet a complete monitoring well network in place, especially when there is a proposed development nearby that is likely to heavily use groundwater. On July 16, 2019, after receiving my letters and listening to community concerns, the EPA directed the responsible parties to further revise the Investigation Work Plan to require a more comprehensive strategy to determine the extent of contamination from the landfill and where it is going. That work is still in progress. The EPA continues to address the contamination emanating from the federally regulated site. As they do so, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) must ensure they strictly monitor and study any proposed projects — such as the one at the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property — thoroughly and impartially. The EPA notes in their letter that EGLE would be the primary agency responsible for oversight of large quantity water withdrawals related to mining projects. The EPA has pledged to communicate with EGLE directly about the site, but I also encourage your office to be receptive to our constituents’ concerns about the proposed mine and its impacts. In addition to environmental issues related to the Superfund site, I also want to note my concern and dismay about the influence state-level lobbyists have exerted over state agencies on matters related to gravel mines. As you are surely aware, proponents of opening additional gravel mines in the state through preemption of local control are using a study produced by the Michigan Dept. of Transportation (MDOT) to advance their position. While there is a case to be made for gravel mine development at a general level, any related decisions should be made objectively, openly, and fairly, with feedback and input from all involved parties. That does not seem to be the case with the study in question. Recent media reports revealed evidence that gravel industry lobbyists made substantial and substantive efforts to direct the MDOT staff working on that taxpayer funded study toward the preferred conclusion of mining proponents. The new MDOT Director Paul Ajegba — whom you appointed — rightfully called for an audit of the contracting practices used for that study. As you work to meet the state’s infrastructure needs, I encourage your administration to maintain the principles of local control, impartial governance, and sound science. I look forward to working with your office, EGLE, and other state and federal agencies to ensure that any developments around the Metamora Landfill Superfund site do not endanger human health or pollute our groundwater. For ease of reference, enclosed please find my correspondence to and from the EPA. I encourage you and your Administration to review these materials and listen to all feedback on this issue. Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By oht_editor | on March 27, 2019 The Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP) recently held a 5,000th Verification Celebration in Lansing, highlighting the success of the voluntary program that has helped Lapeer County farms prevent and minimize pollution risks. The milestone represents the work and investment of more than 2,000 producers and agricultural and conservation partners across the state. As a longtime supporter, Michigan Farm Bureau (MFB) and county Farm Bureau members played a significant role in the program’s development, implementation and growth over its first two decades. A turning point for the program — and when the goal was set to reach 5,000 verifications — came in 2011, when legislation supported by MFB and sponsored by now-Senator Kevin Daley, R-Arcadia Township and former Senator Joe Hune, was signed into law. The Lapeer Conservation District has been instrumental in the verification of many dozens of farms in recent years — and that’s good news to the entire county, whether you live on a neighboring farm or miles down the road because the result is a better and healthier environment for all residents. The County Press in our keepsake Progress 2019 edition (March 3) showcased the achievements of local MAEAP verifications. MAEAP is a voluntary environmental program that works individually with farmers to identify and prevent environmental risks on farms that could result in groundwater or surface water contamination. The program evaluates various aspects of farms based on four systems: Farmstead, cropping, livestock, and forest, wetlands and habitat. After mitigating risks on the farm associated with one of the systems, MDARD staff visit the farm to verify the implementation of practices and verify the farm as meeting the program standards. Sen. Daley attended the March 21 event and reflected on the program. “MAEAP helps farmers to be better environmental stewards of their land and is a great example of how the agricultural community, environmental groups, and the government can work together to better the industry,” Daley said. “The 5000th MAEAP verification is a great accomplishment and I am proud to see the success of this program.” A fifth-generation farmer, Lapeer County and Michigan are fortunate to have Daley working on behalf of the agriculture community. He was first elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2009 and represented the 82nd District until 2014, when term limits prevented him from seeking another term. As one of the few farmers in the House at the time, he was the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. In 2018, he was elected to represent the 31st state Senate District, which includes Lapeer, Tuscola and Bay counties. He now serves as chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and is well versed in how MAEAP works. His farm, Daley Acres, is MAEAP verified — as is the Howell Farm owned by Rep. Gary Howell, R-Deerfield Township. Howell and his son, John, operate the farm. Howell has been a member of the Farm Bureau for 34 years, receiving the 2005 Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award. Daley has served on the Lapeer County Farm Bureau Board of Directors, Lapeer County Ag. Preservation Board, and is the former president of the Tri-County Michigan Milk Producers Association. Lapeer County is unique to be served by lawmakers in both Chambers, the House and the Senate, with deep and personal agricultural roots to this community who want the countryside to be free of agricultural pollutants for generations to come. The Lapeer Conservation District, a proud partner of MAEAP with Lapeer County’s legislators, for more than 70 years has worked with local landowners, farmers, governmental agencies, and other organizations to deal with environmental problems. The district board meets at the District Office at 700 South Main St. in Lapeer, Suite 120-C. Meetings are held on the third Thursday of each month at 8 a.m. The public is encouraged to attend.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on September 02, 2018 New directional lights (top left) have been added at Cramton Park in Lapeer following an Aug. 2 chemical burn incident that injured two children, ages 1 and 14. New directional lights (top left) have been added at Cramton Park in Lapeer following an Aug. 2 chemical burn incident that injured two children, ages 1 and 14. LAPEER — The City of Lapeer has installed new directional lighting to improve security at city parks following an Aug. 2 incident when someone put sodium hydroxide on a slide at Cramton Park, resulting in third-degree burns to the legs of a 1-year-old boy. The City of Lapeer operates 13 parks, each one with its own unique physical and logistical issues related to security — and they’re all being reviewed by city staff whether added security measures should be added to the facilities. Lapeer City Manager Dale Kerbyson said discussions are ongoing with leadership at the police department, parks and recreation and the Dept. of Public Works to assess if there may be any vulnerable areas where added measures may enhance security. On Aug. 2 a 1-year-old boy went down a slide at Cramton Park and immediately began to cry and exhibit pain at which time his 14-year-old cousin picked him up, transferring some amounts of the sodium hydroxide onto her skin. The teen was treated and released for her injuries at McLaren Lapeer Region, while the toddler spent several days in the burn unit at Hurley Medical Center in Flint. The slide, located south of Farmers Creek and on the east side of Monroe Street, is more isolated from the rest of the park because it sits further back from Genesee and Monroe streets where it may be less visible to passersby — including police officers. The slide was thoroughly cleaned and has been reopened to public use. Employees with the city’s Dept. of Public Works, said Kerbyson, have since installed two large flood lights on a small brick pump-station building in the far southeast corner of the park — throwing more light in that section of the park to dissuade any further tampering of playscape equipment and improve security to that corner of the park. “We’re looking to put up additional lights around playscapes at other parks,” said Kerbyson, who noted city staff wants to enhance security, but also must be mindful not to create light pollution issues with neighboring residences. There is one video surveillance camera already in use at Cramton Park, and the city may add another unit to the large park. The existing camera did not face the section of the park where the Aug. 2 chemical burn incident occurred. The City maintains numerous other surveillance cameras in the city. The scale of the city’s park and pathway system it maintains, and also polices, is massive. Lapeer has several small neighborhood parks including the quarter-acre Veterans Memorial Park located just east of Main Street off Nepessing Street and Perkins Park in the northwest section of the city. Nearly an acre, this park at the northeast corner of Oregon and Lincoln streets features playground equipment, a pavilion and seasonal portable toilets. Rowden Park, located off North Lapeer Road (M-24), this 65-acre park is the city’s largest and features one mile of continuous asphalt pathway, two boardwalks over wetland areas as well as a playground, sledding hill, two parking lots and year-round bathrooms. The next largest Lapeer park is Prairies & Ponds at Oakdale. This 37.5-acre park located off Genesee Street near Chatfield School includes limestone trails, a floating dock, bridges, a pavilion and nature observation areas. “The City takes great pride in its parks, and we will continue to look at areas and ways we can enhance security, while at the same time not infringe on peoples’ sense of privacy,” Kerbyson said. Police patrols through and around city parks have been increased since the Aug. 2 incident at Cramton Park and the Aug. 26 discovery of a body of a 17-year-old Attica Township boy in the Flint River at Rotary Park — a sevenacre park located along the eastern border of downtown Lapeer on East Nepessing Street. An autopsy determined that Jared Bristol drowned, however police continue their investigation to determine if there were other factors that may have contributed to his death.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on June 17, 2018 The nearly 2,000 acres of the Holloway Reservoir in Marathon and Oregon townships are a favorite recreation spot for locals and visitors alike. The nearly 2,000 acres of the Holloway Reservoir in Marathon and Oregon townships are a favorite recreation spot for locals and visitors alike. COLUMBIAVILLE — According to a Dept. of Natural Resources “Eat Fish Safe Guide” report published by the Michigan Dept. of Health, several species of fish in the Holloway Reservoir are affected by contaminants originating from Lapeer Plating & Plastics. According to the DNR’s Eat Fish Safe Guide, carp caught in the Holloway Reservoir, or in the Flint River between the reservoir and Mott Dam in Flint, should be eaten no more than twice a month. Large and small-mouth bass consumption should be limited to no more than six per year, and rock bass and walleye should be eaten no more frequently than once per month. Each of these species of fish have been found to contain a manmade chemical referred to as PFOS. The Michigan Dept. of Environmental Quality has stated that while swimming in the Holloway Reservoir is safe, swimmers are advised against swallowing water. In Michigan, the Dept. of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) sets the amount of allowable PFOS at 12 parts per trillion (ppt) or less. One ppt equates to a single drop of food coloring in the equivalent of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools. In an Oct. 27, 2017 letter to Lapeer Plating, the MDEQ noted 13 violations of law generally related to EPA requirements. testing of wastewater from Lapeer Plating showed the company “is the primary known contributor of high levels of PFOS to the Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant, and that this pollutant is being passed through to waters of the state as well as stored in the city’s biosolids.” As recent as August 2017, tests showed 19,000 ppt of PFOS originating at Lapeer Plating. Recent PFOS levels found in the Lapeer County areas of the Flint River, including the Holloway Reservoir, range between 50 and 95 parts per billion. PFOS, or Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, is a chemical used in several industries and is found to be a carcinogen in both fish and humans. PFOS collects in plants along riverbeds and lake bottoms and is ingested by fish. It is likely the advisory will remain in effect for “an additional couple of years,” said MDEQ Biologist Joe Bore in a Holloway Lake Association newsletter. According to Bore, PFOS detected in fish has “a short half-life” and therefore conditions will improve quickly once the source of contamination is contained and eliminated.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on April 22, 2018 A monofilament recycling tube is helping state parks locally, and nationwide, collect used fishing line through Michigan Sea Grant and its partnership with the Dept. of Natural Resources fisheries division. A monofilament recycling tube is helping state parks locally, and nationwide, collect used fishing line through Michigan Sea Grant and its partnership with the Dept. of Natural Resources fisheries division. LAPEER COUNTY — Earth Day 2018, which falls on today, Sunday, April 22, and its networks of faithful stewards have chosen plastic pollution as its call to action. Hunters, anglers and outdoor enthusiasts alike have specific plastics that they can help keep out of landfills and the world’s lake, rivers and oceans—namely plastic shell casings from ammunition, plastic targets, and monofilament nylon fishing line, fishing nets, plastic bait cups and other containers. Monofilament fishing line is said to last 600 years in fresh water and is a leading cause of death in marine life, as it either ingests, or get tangled in the discarded lines. To make it easier for anglers to properly dispose of used fishing line, 90 sites across Michigan, including Metamora-Hadley Recreation Area, have a recycling tube provided by Michigan Sea Grant, a cooperative program of the University of Michigan and Michigan State University that is part of the National Sea Grant College Program. The network of 33 university-based Sea Grant programs in coastal states across the country is administered through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Federal funds are matched with funds from state, tribal, business and other non-federal sources to carry out the programs. The other locations throughout the state that have a recycling tube can be found at http:// www.miseagrant.umich.edu/ explore/fisheries/monofilamentrecycling program/ monofilament-recycling-programparticipants/. Millions of spent shotgun shell casing litter ranges and public lands each year. “Sea Grant sent us some tubes, I believe through the DNR Fisheries division,” said Todd Farrell, Park Supervisor at Metamora-Hadley. “We put them out at the fishing pier and that program started several years ago.” It’s not just plastics that Metamora-Hadley tries to reclaim. Farrell said the park puts recycle containers at the camp host sites and that has been in place for at least 10 years. He noted that a former camp host built a container for bottles and cans and the monies collected from those recyclables go back to the camp host program. “We also have recycle containers for cardboard, plastic and metal,” said Farrell. “The camp hosts bring it to the headquarters building for recycling and last year through the DNR we got a recycling container for our day users. We’re just trying to do our part to get people to put their plastic water bottles in there, in particular, by the beach and by the camp host sites. The DNR does encourage everyone to recycle when they visit our state parks.” The monofilament collected is melted down and made into tackle boxes, toys, fishing habitats and plastic pellets that eventually become outdoor furniture and plastic poly lumbers. Plastic drinking water bottles are the biggest challenge with only 23 percent recycled yearly according to the Earth Day Network. Earth Day.org states that many end up in the rivers, lakes and oceans as floating trash. Plastic straws are also on the hit list with 500 million used by Americans each day. Because of the makeup of plastic straws, they are listed as No. 5 plastics and not many recycling centers accept them. EarthDay.org says that 90 percent of the debris in our oceans is plastic—shopping bags, straws, cups, bottles and fishing line—and that only one percent of plastic shopping bags are recycled. Those, too, are a unique type of plastic and have to be taken back to the stores for recycling. Not so easy to recycle is the shell casings, or hulls, from used shotgun shells. Some do reclaim the spent shells and reload them, but the vast majority are discarded because of their complexity. It’s not just plastic that is part of a shotgun shell, as it is made up of paper, metal and plastic. Recycling centers across the nation who do accept the hulls take them apart and resize the different components turning it into plastic poly lumber. An online search found a judge’s chair made from recycled shotgun hulls, while others were turned into toys, coasters, plastic pellets and other home goods. Still, shooting ranges have a myriad of other plastic trash that could be better served as recyclables rather than ending up in landfills. It’s all about being good stewards. Brass is easily used for reloading and many recycling centers pay by the pound for the brass ammunition leftovers. Jack Briggs, range safety officer at Lapeer County Sportsman’s Club noted that the Club does recycle its brass from the various ranges, but he was unsure about the plastic shell casings. Hunters Creek Club in Metamora said they also do not currently recycle their plastic shell casings. Until recyclers find a solution for the ranges, their hands are tied. EarthDay.org has made available a plastic calculator at www.earthday.org/plastic-calculator/ so consumers can see exactly what their plastic footprint looks like and how to properly recycle and how to dispose of plastics.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on December 24, 2017 Thomas Woolley, industrial surveillance, Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant, explains how one of the facility’s domed secondary treatment clarifiers works to clean wastewater and prepare it for eventual discharge into the Flint River. Thomas Woolley, industrial surveillance, Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant, explains how one of the facility’s domed secondary treatment clarifiers works to clean wastewater and prepare it for eventual discharge into the Flint River. LAPEER — Officials say they’ve cut the flow of dangerous contaminants through the city’s wastewater treatment plant into the Flint River, but have only just begun to deal with another problem — about 1.5 million gallons of toxic sludge. On Dec. 15, the Michigan Dept. of Environmental Quality issued the City of Lapeer a permit that allows the Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) to move ahead with plans to set up a temporary system to effectively treat the massive amount of sludge so it can be moved to a landfill. The sludge contains polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — a chemical the EPA says has a number of potentially adverse effects on animals and humans, including a possible link to cancer. On Oct. 4, MDEQ announced it had determined elevated levels of PFAS and another related — and dangerous — compound, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), found in the Flint River originated with the Lapeer WWTP, where officials in turn traced it to Lapeer Plating & Plastics. (MDEQ said it didn’t affect drinking water, but could impact fish.) One of the sludge tanks at Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant. The sludge will be “cleaned” soon so that dangerous chemicals can be kept from the environment. MDEQ officials ordered the city and Lapeer Plating to take immediate steps to address the problem. Lapeer City Manager Dale Kerbyson said it’s been a top priority. “We take it extremely seriously and that’s why we got on it so quickly,” he said, noting the MDEQ has “been a good partner” with the city. In a statement to The County Press, Dean Harlow, CEO, Lapeer Plating, said the company “is working cooperatively with the City of Lapeer and MDEQ to evaluate and address potential discharge of water containing residual from (Lapeer Plating’s) operations.” The City of Lapeer accepts municipal sanitary and industrial wastewater from the city, along with parts of Elba and Mayfield townships. Thomas Woolley, industrial surveillance, Lapeer Wastewater Treatment Plant, holds a sample of water that had been processed by the plant and was headed for its next stop, the Flint River. Thomas Woolley, industrial surveillance, Lapeer WWTP, told The County Press that about 1.5 million gallons of wastewater flow into the plant every day. About the same amount of treated water is discharged daily to the South Branch of the Flint River. The total amount of time from when wastewater enters the treatment facility until is cleaned and discharged into the Flint River is about 30 hours. According to a DEQ letter dated Sept. 7, 2017 sent to Pam Reid, director of the Lapeer Dept. of Public Works, river samples received in June indicated that the Lapeer WWTP was a “significant source of PFOS discharging to the Flint River.” MDEQ notified the city that “The pass-through of pollutants that are, or may become, injurious to the designated uses of the Flint River, including impairment of fisheries, is a violation of” two permits the city needs for the plant, including the permit that allows it to discharge processed water into the Flint River. It further stated an inspection on July 11, 2017 focused on Lapeer Plating & Plastics “because it is the only known metal finisher discharging to the Lapeer WWTP.” According to MDEQ, PFOS and PFAS belong to a class of man-made chemicals used in many industrial applications and consumer products including fire-fighting foams, water proof membranes for outdoor gear, paints and coatings, and non-stick cookware. Used for decades, the chemicals are known to be very stable and do not break down in the environment. (When the persistent nature and potential health effects of the chemicals were identified, their manufacture ceased in the U.S. and use in the chromium electroplating process was phased out by federal regulations in September of 2015.) “PFOS is of particular concern because it bioaccumulates in fish,” wrote Stephanie Kammer, MDEQ district supervisor, in a Sept. 7 letter to the city. In the electroplating industry, the problematic chemical was initially approved as one method to control air emissions. Wooley confirmed that Lapeer Plating was using the chemicals for that purpose. In an Oct. 27 letter to Lapeer Plating, the MDEQ noted 13 violations of law generally related to EPA requirements. The letter noted testing of wastewater from Lapeer Plating that showed the company “is the primary known contributor of high levels of PFOS to the Lapeer WWTP, and that this pollutant is being passed through to waters of the state as well as stored in the city’s biosolids.” In a statement, Harlow told The County Press that the company “is taking all actions requested by the Michigan DEQ to date to address past use and potential discharge of water containing PFOS.” In a Nov. 22 letter to MDEQ, Harlow outlined how the chemicals were previously used by Lapeer Plating and steps taken in the last several months to stem the flow to Lapeer WWTP. Harlow said Lapeer Plating used a PFOS-based chemical starting April 21, 2010 until June. 11, 2013. In October and November, the company “thoroughly cleaned” several tanks “believed to be the original historical source of the PFOS.” The company also ordered a “short-term rental carbon filtering system” and agreed it will take weekly samples for testing until further notice. Other steps taken include removing equipment with potential exposure to storm water, developing a “pollution incident prevention plan,” removal of hazardous waste from the company’s property, among other things. Harlow told The County Press Friday that the company “is in the process of installing a permanent state-of-the-art treatment system to address PFOS in its discharge.” Kerbyson gave credit to Lapeer Plating officials for their attention to the matter and said city staff is meeting with company representatives on a weekly basis. Woolley said test results indicate lowered levels of the chemicals. However, the city is now stuck with a massive amount of sludge that pre-dates the fixes recently implemented. Sludge, oftentimes called “biosolids,” is a result of the heaviest solids that flow into the plant. During the treatment process, the heavy solids are pumped into large holding tanks. The resulting material looks like mud. Woolley said Lapeer WWTP currently has about 1.5 million gallons of sludge being stored. While in the tanks, the heaviest solids sink to the bottom and are pumped through a centrifuge as part of a “dewatering” process. The resulting “dewatered” material can be suitable for use as fertilizer, and in the case of Lapeer WWTP, when enough accumulates it is trucked to local farms. However, Lapeer WWTP must have a permit to do so. MDEQ took away Lapeer WWTP’s permit in September, Woolley said, just before the plant was to truck out another big load to area farms. The reason is simple: the material can’t be used as fertilizer if it’s full of toxic chemicals. “Regarding disposal of your biosolids, careful consideration needs to be made to ensure that contaminants are not transferred from one media to another,” said Carla Davidson, of MDEQ’s water resources division, in an email to city officials on Oct. 3. To address the problematic sludge, a temporary system will be set up by a company contracted by the city. Starting Jan. 5, it will operate 10 hours a day, five days a week, and process 180,000 gallons per day. The purpose will be to essentially clean the sludge by pulling out the dangerous contaminants through the elaborate temporary filtering system. The “clean” sludge will then be landfilled, according to the permit. “There are just many steps here to make sure we completely protect the environment,” Kerbyson said. The permit indicates addressing the problem will take about six weeks. “We’ve got to get rid of what we got,” Woolley said. “Clean out the system.” Kerbyson and Woolley both said it won’t be cheap, but didn’t want to provide a figure on how much it will cost. Kerbyson said Lapeer Plating has agreed to cover any and all associated costs with the project. “We know that the company has committed to covering the costs so we have not turned in a claim to our insurance company,” Kerbyson said. Still, Kerbyson can’t help but think the problem could have been addressed years ago. “The DEQ was aware of the PFOS problem in 2013, and it took them until this summer to mention it to us,” Kerbyson said. “We have this PFOS issue solved and I’m going to say, on an optimistic side, completely cleaned up by the middle of next month,” Kerbyson said. “We did that in six or seven months. If they had notified us in 2013, it would’ve been done years ago.” Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on November 05, 2017 The nearly 23-acre Brown City sewage lagoon system (upper right) has become a favorite resting spot for a gaggle of more than 400 Canada geese as they migrate south. They like it so well they don’t want to leave. The nearly 23-acre Brown City sewage lagoon system (upper right) has become a favorite resting spot for a gaggle of more than 400 Canada geese as they migrate south. They like it so well they don’t want to leave. BROWN CITY — A gaggle of more than 400 Canada geese have taken up temporary residence on the shores of the Brown City municipal sewage lagoons, and City Hall isn’t happy. The problem is that large volumes of goose droppings have elevated the bacteria count level of the partially purified sewer water to the point where it exceeds the allowable standard for discharging it into the adjacent county drain. According to City Manager Clint Holmes, the water is tested once in the spring and once in the fall. The permissible level of fecal coliform established by the Michigan Dept. of Environmental Quality is 200 colonies per 100 milliliters of water. A recent test revealed the city’s lagoons’ level to be 1,065, five times the allowable limit. The Brown City lagoon system property is on the east side of Maple Valley Road just north of M-90. It consists of three cells, or ponds, surrounded and divided by berms of soil. Cell number one covers 6.4 acres holding a maximum 8.25 million gallons of water. Cell number two is the same size. Cell number three covers 10 acres with a maximum holding capacity of 31 million gallons. According to Holmes, the city pumps into the lagoons about 108 million gallons of raw sewage per year. That is between 180,000 and 240,000 gallons per day. Holmes said that the city discharges approximately 96 million gallons of partially purified sewer water per year into the county drain, with another 12 million gallons disappearing through evaporation. The lagoons are designed with a 47.5 million gallon holding capacity, which could store 260,000 gallons of sewage for 180 days before being discharged. Council member Bill Walters summed up the situation for the city council on October 23, saying, “It seems to me we need to see what we can do to get rid of the pooh.” After some discussion about how much a goose eats per day, and how much a goose defecates per day, along with some talk of other more peaceful means of moving the geese on, it was decided that the matter can best be settled by the barrel of a goose gun. Council instructed Holmes to enlist two or three responsible goose hunters for the task of taking enough of the fowl so as to encourage the rest of them to continue on with their migratory journey. As of last Wednesday, Holmes said two hunters had volunteered, with a third expected to sign on later in the day. The hunters were required to furnish the city with a liability release in case of a mishap. Unauthorized hunting on the site is strictly prohibited. Due to the many problems caused for humans by huge numbers of Canada geese stubbornly congregating in places regarded as outside their habitat in the wild, the species is no longer federally protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Along with other state actions, the result is that, though they are not officially designated as “pests,” geese can be readily killed. Your email address will not be published.

While the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to keep the 2018 conventional biofuels level at 15 billion gallons, as called for in the Renewable Fuel Standard, is good news, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) is warning that EPA’s plan to reduce additional levels of required “advanced biofuels” in the nation’s fuel supply will undermine goals to create a more robust renewable fuels industry and greater energy independence. “Renewable fuels have been a tremendous success story for the country and for the rural economy,” said Dale Moore, AFBF executive director of public policy. “The Renewable Fuel Standard has reduced our country’s dependence on foreign crude oil, reduced air pollution, increased farm incomes and provided good-paying jobs in rural America.” The prospects of EPA dialing back the advanced biofuels requirement couldn’t come at a worse time for the current farm economy, according to Michigan Farm Bureau Field Crops and Advisory Specialist, Kate Thiel, citing depressed crop prices below cost of production for major commodities – most notably corn and soybeans. “The reasonable additional biofuel requirements being asked for here would help tremendously in stimulating crop prices as well as provide an economic boost throughout rural Michigan,” Thiel said. “EPA’s intention to reduce the 2018 requirements for advanced renewable fuel to 4.24 billion gallons, down from 4.28 billion gallons this year, not only dampens the prospects for reduced emissions and increased energy security, but also inhibits investment in cleaner, domestic fuels and the infrastructure needed to accommodate higher biofuel blends—all of which are goals of the RFS.” According to AFBF’s Moore, EPA’s proposal includes an overall 2018 biofuel mandate of 19.24 billion gallons, with 15 billion gallons of that in conventional biofuels, or ethanol, and 4.24 billion gallons in advanced biofuels. “The RFS was designed to give American consumers more choices at the pump and lower gas prices, and to utilize biofuel as more than just a gasoline additive with octane-boosting value. But EPA’s 2018 proposal fails to send the signal to the industry that greater infrastructure investment is needed and meaningful marketplace changes need to occur,” Moore said. Farm Bureau is urging EPA to set the advanced biofuel requirements for 2018 at 5.25 billion gallons and the biomass-based diesel volume for 2019 at 2.75 billion gallons. EPA intends to finalize the rule by Nov. 30. Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on August 30, 2017 September is National Food Safety Month and this year’s theme is “Notorious Virus.” September is National Food Safety Month and this year’s theme is “Notorious Virus.” Many people don’t know that viruses can bring about foodborne illness, and they blame it on bacteria, but some of the largest outbreaks in the United States are caused by Norovirus and Hepatitis A – both virulent viruses. Norovirus is often referred to as the “stomach bug.” Many of us have had it without knowing our illness was caused by a virus. Norovirus comes on quickly, usually within a couple hours, and symptoms consist of vomiting and diarrhea, stomach cramping and even fever and body aches. In some at-risk people like the elderly, small children and those with a weakened immune system, it can cause severe dehydration leading to hospital stays. Some in the at-risk population die from their symptoms. The norovirus illness usually lasts no more than a few days in healthy people. The best way to avoid getting norovirus is to wash your hands often, especially if coming in contact with someone with the “stomach bug.” The virus can be infectious for a long time on sinks, and other inanimate objects, so touching something that the sick person touched, like dishes or laundry, can bring about the illness. It can be transferred through food as well, so if you are experiencing symptoms DO NOT prepare food. You should also be sure to rinse all fruit and vegetables, cook food to its required minimum internal temperature, and clean and sanitize kitchen surfaces often. Hepatitis A is quite different from Norovirus. You can have the virus for weeks before showing any symptoms. Some symptoms are the same as with norovirus, but fatigue, joint pain, dark urine and yellowing of the skin (jaundice) also occurs. There can also be pain or discomfort in the area of the liver. Hepatitis A lasts for weeks to several months, and if you believe you have the virus, you should contact your doctor. Hepatitis A can be spread by drinking contaminated water, being close to someone who has the virus, including sexual contact, eating food polluted by sewage, and eating food prepared by someone with the virus if they don’t wash their hands properly after using the toilet. If any of these pertain to you, and you have symptoms, you should make an appointment with your doctor or health center to be tested. There are many other viruses that can cause illness, but these two are the focus of National Food Safety Month this year. Michigan State University Extension recommends you learn about how bacteria and viruses can cause you to be ill, and take precautions like washing your hands well and often to avoid becoming ill.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on August 02, 2017 A windy day looking out on Lake Superior. A windy day looking out on Lake Superior. The Lenawee Conservation District has been awarded three Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) grants by the Great Lakes Commission totaling $300,000. The Lenawee Conservation District projects will address phosphorous and sediment reduction needs at multiple sites throughout the district. “The Great Lakes are a magnificent national and natural treasure, and we have a responsibility to preserve them for generations to come,” said Congressman Tim Walberg, who made the announcement. “The Lenawee Conservation District is doing important work to protect the health of our waterways and communities, and I’m pleased to see their ongoing efforts recognized. These grants also highlight the need to continue funding the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to protect the Great Lakes, which are a vital economic and environmental asset for Michigan and the entire country.” “I’d like to congratulate Lenawee Conservation District for being awarded this grant in support of their work protecting the health and sustainability of our Great Lakes,” said Tim Eder, executive director of the Great Lakes Commission. “This project demonstrates the power of the GLRI to generate critical economic and environmental improvements for communities throughout the region. Thank you to Rep. Walberg for your continued support of this important initiative.” The Great Lakes Commission manages the Great Lakes Sediment and Nutrient Reduction Program, which strategically addresses polluting phosphorus and sediments from entering the Great Lakes Basin with a unique, targeted grassroots approach which awards grants to nonfederal agencies and nonprofit organizations in priority watersheds throughout the region. Funding for this program is provided by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative under a cooperative agreement between the Great Lakes Commission and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on April 27, 2016 LANSING — Individual environmental responsibility was given lip service by nearly eight out of 10 respondents in a recent survey about the Great Lakes, issued the week before Earth Day (April 22). The survey, conducted on behalf of the International Joint Commission (IJC), “was intended to establish baseline data across an array of perceptions ranging from perceived threats to the Great Lakes and the importance of watershed and Great Lakes protection, to awareness of the IJC and cross-border water protection efforts.” While the survey showed a wide range of perceptions, it also could serve as an indictment of public ignorance about the issues that impact the lakes. In one question, for example, participants were asked to name “anything that you feel may pose a threat to the lakes and rivers that surround and feed into the Great Lakes.” Responses indicated that 24 percent didn’t know. 23 percent said invasive species, 13 percent said pollution in general. Agricultural pollution, waste and runoff was cited by only 2 percent of respondents from eight Great Lakes states (including Michigan) and Ontario. “With all the publicity that seems to come from extremist groups that point the finger at agriculture, that’s surprising,” said Laura Campbell, manager of Michigan Farm Bureau’s Agriculture Ecology Department. “But it is good, because farmers are working very hard to protect the Lakes.” Perhaps in keeping with the bafflement of survey takers, “The role of individual responsibility for protecting the health of the lakes (was) cited by 78 percent of respondents, although 30 percent are unsure what steps they can take.” As Earth Day approached last week, Campbell said farmers are leading the way. “The public may not know what to do,” she said, “But farmers are already acting. They are taking individual responsibility for the Great Lakes, and their efforts are far more significant than most people realize.” Oddly, at the same time the 4,000 survey respondents cited individual responsibility for the lakes, 45 percent listed government as responsible for the lakes’ health. More oddly, in the section about watershed protection, government at various levels were cited as being “currently responsible for protecting the health of the Great Lakes basin” by 39 percent of respondents. Farmers, however, tend not to trust in government regulation to accomplish much. In Michigan, Campbell said, the premiere voluntary environmental program in the nation proves that government mandates do little by comparison to collective, voluntary efforts of individuals. “These environmental issues, as well as the lakes and the basin itself, are so complicated that we’re not surprised people are confused,” Campbell said. “But the efforts of farmers in the entire basin show a sense of responsibility toward the lakes and the environment. In Michigan, we have quantifiable results that show the level of concern by farmers and the benefits of that individual action.” She’s referring, of course, to the Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP), which shows that more than 3,100 farms have been verified by an independent state agency as having put practices in place to protect the environment, with a heavy emphasis on water quality and preventing nutrient leaching. Ten thousand additional farms have started in the MAEAP program and already are adding to the impression record which shows that, since 2011, MAEAP-verified farms have: Kept more than 160,000 dump trucks of sediment ON farms and OUT of Michigan waters (if it was concrete, that much would build nearly three Ford Fields). Kept enough nutrients out of Michigan waters to grow nearly 1 million tons of algae (that amount would more than cover Houghton and Higgins Lakes). What is the IJC? The IJC is an international organization created by the Boundary Waters Treaty, signed by Canada and the United States in 1909. It advises the U.S. and Canadian governments on safeguarding the Great Lakes for drinking, swimming, fishing and the health of the ecosystem. Science, transparency and public engagement are principles underlying the Commission’s Great Lakes water quality work. Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on April 27, 2016 The Caro Poet plant will expand to produce 67 million gallons per year, compared to the 55 million gallons it’s producing now. The Caro Poet plant will expand to produce 67 million gallons per year, compared to the 55 million gallons it’s producing now. CARO — While opposition to ethanol production has seen many, varied arguments over the years, most of them have been debunked by efficiency and common sense, according to Dave Gloer, general manager of the Caro Poet plant. “I think four or five years ago, we heard the argument that corn for ethanol was taking food off people’s table, but I don’t hear that much anymore,” Gloer said. “We’ve never used anything but No. 2 yellow commercial grade corn used for animal feed and industrial purposes like plastics. Now the opposition to ethanol seems to come from the oil industry, and it’s evolved into a fight over market share, pure and simple.” Arguments over water use to produce ethanol also become moot when compared to oil production, Gloer said. “We use far less water than oil uses to generate a gallon of gas,” he said. “We use two gallons of water to produce one gallon of ethanol, and the oil industry uses closer to 20.” Actually, depending on the source of information, it takes at least 44 gallons of water to produce one gallon of gasoline, according to Answers.com. If you add in diesel fuel, that number surges to 97 gallons of water per gallon of fuel. Another debunked argument is that it takes more heat units (Btu) to make ethanol that it produces. “If that were true, we would not be in business,” Gloer said. “In this plant, if you look at all the Btu we consume, it’s still one-third of the Btus in a gallon of ethanol. Besides that, a large amount of the Btu we use is for drying the animal feed. That’s not part of the ethanol process. We also burn a lot of Btu as part of our pollution control process according to our permit.” Knowing all that, remember too that ethanol’s process is getting more efficient all the time. “I’ve been here nine years, and the technology improvements are mindboggling,” Gloer said. “When I started, we got 2.7 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn. Now we’re closer to three. The maximum is 3.15, if we convert every bit of starch in the corn. I don’t know if we’ll ever stop getting more yield out of the corn, but we may find that the curve is getting flatter.” As ethanol becomes more efficient to make, Poet plans to follow the trend. It announced in January that it will expand to produce 67 million gallons per year, compared to the 55 million gallons it’s producing now. Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on April 20, 2016 Friday is Earth Day in Lapeer County and across our nation. Each year April 22 marks the anniversary of the birth of the modern environmental movement in 1970. The height of counterculture in the United States, 1970 brought the death of Jimi Hendrix, the last Beatles album, and Simon & Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” War raged in Vietnam and students nationwide overwhelmingly opposed it. At the time, Americans were slurping leaded gas through massive V8 sedans. Industry belched out smoke and sludge with little fear of legal consequences or bad press. Air pollution was commonly accepted as the smell of prosperity. “Environment” was a word that appeared more often in spelling bees than on the evening news. Earth Day 1970 gave voice to that emerging consciousness, channeling the energy of the anti-war protest movement and putting environmental concerns on the front page. The idea for a national day to focus on the environment came to Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson, then a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, after witnessing the ravages of the 1969 massive oil spill in Santa Barbara, Calif. Inspired by the student anti-war movement, he realized that if he could infuse that energy with an emerging public consciousness about air and water pollution, it would force environmental protection onto the national political agenda. Here in Michigan on this Earth Day week we wish to bring to your attention the potential for a massive oil spill that would be hard to contain and clean up — and it’s found deep below the majestic Straits of Mackinac that separate the state’s peninsulas. Each day, according to recent press reports, some 540,000 barrels of light crude oil and natural gas liquids pass below the Straits en route from the shale oil wells of Alberta to refineries in Detroit and Sarnia, Ontario. The pipes, known as Line 5, are 20 inches in diameter, with one-inch-thick walls. The state of Michigan granted the underwater easement in 1953. Line 5’s existence was all but forgotten until another Enbridge pipe, Line 6B, burst open in July 2010 and over 18 hours spewed as much as 1.1 million gallons of heavy crude oil into the Kalamazoo River near the town of Marshall. In the wake of that — the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history — and with the fight raging over TransCanada’s proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline across the Great Plains, environmentalists looked around to see where else Enbridge was moving oil to Michigan. To the surprise of many, they realized that it operated a major line through one of the world’s most sensitive freshwater areas. The Washington Post reported that Attorney General Bill Schuette, a GOP front-runner for governor in 2018, appeared to condemn Line 5 in comments when he released a report last summer from the Michigan Petroleum Pipeline Task Force that he chairs. He told the Post, “You wouldn’t site, and you wouldn’t build and construct pipelines beneath the Straits today.” And yet the Canadian-owned Enbridge company has received a reprieve because Schuette has declined to order an immediate shutdown, as he could under the terms of the state’s agreement with Enbridge regarding the easement. Instead, he established a Pipeline Safety Advisory Board to study all of the state’s spaghetti tangle of pipelines and make recommendations as to what to do. That committee, which has met twice, is ordering up a comprehensive report on how Enbridge would transport the oil and gas in Line 5 to refineries if it could no longer pump it through the Straits. Enbridge’s position is that they’re a better company — that it learned from the Kalamazoo River disaster. They say they’re not the same company that had a long poor maintenance history and that it has pre-positioned equipment in northern Michigan in the event of the unthinkable. Enbridge says to trust them, that their pipelines beneath the Straits are safe. On this Earth Day week, we can’t take the chance they’re wrong and urge our elected lawmakers — Rep. Gary Howell and Sen. Mike Green — to work to insist our state’s abundant fresh water is protected from international pipeline companies. Earth Day matters, every day.

Darryl Haines of Marlette Township hauled corn last fall from leased fields in Burnside Township to the POET Biorefining plant in Caro that produces 53 million gallons of ethanol annually. NORTH BRANCH TWP. — EPA finished off a week of challenging relations with the agriculture community by announcing its long-delayed renewable fuel standards for 2014 through 2016. It adds up to 15.93 billion gallons of renewable fuel for 2014, 16.3 billion gallons in 2015, and 17.40 billion gallons in 2016, according to the EPA’s “ambitious, yet responsible growth” plan for the biofuel industry. “This proposal marks an important step forward in making sure the renewable fuel standard program delivers on the Congressional intent to increase biofuel use, lower greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security,” said Janet McCabe, the acting assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Air, which released the figures Friday. “We believe these proposed volume requirements will provide a strong incentive for continued investment and growth in biofuels.” The standards cover cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and corn ethanol. While the numbers do represent an increase in the amount of biofuel required in the past by the EPA, the proposed volumes are lower than Congress had targeted. It was not what seemingly anyone wanted to hear. “The anti-ethanol crowd, led by grocery chains and corn users, insists that every acre of corn used for ethanol keeps food and feed prices higher than they would be otherwise,” noted Alan Brugler of Brugler Marketing and Management. “Ethanol and corn grower groups aren’t happy because there is surplus corn available both here and around the world, and the proposed targets are below what the actual law required. Lawsuits are expected.» “EPA has to be given some credit for attempting to get the RFS back on track by increasing the renewable volume obligations (RVOs) over time,” said Bob Dineen, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. “But the frustrating fact is the agency continues to misunderstand the clear intent of the statute — to drive innovation in both ethanol production and ethanol marketing. The agency has eviscerated the program’s ability to incentivize investments in infrastructure that would break through the blend wall and encourage the commercialization of new technologies. Today’s announcement represents a step backward for the RFS.” Biofuel producers agreed. “Today’s proposal by the EPA puts the oil industry’s agenda ahead of farmers and rural America. While the EPA is correct in recognizing the intent of Congress to continue growth in biofuels, the targets announced today fall well short of rural America’s potential to produce low-cost, clean-burning ethanol,” said Jeff Lautt, CEO of POET, the South Dakota-based ethanol producer. “America’s farmers have answered the call laid out in the Renewable Fuel Standard to help wean our nation off of foreign oil. Agriculture has taken incredible strides in recent years, growing yields through efficient farming practices and technology improvements, and we have all reaped the benefits of that labor through greater availability of high-performance, domestically produced ethanol.” Some members of Congress were also unhappy with the EPA’s proposal. “Unfortunately, EPA’s announcement falls short of accomplishing the goals laid out in the Renewable Fuel Standard,” said U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan), ranking member of theSenate Agriculture Committee. “The advanced biofuels industry creates thousands of jobs in rural America, all while reducing pollution and reducing ourdependencyonforeign oil.” Crop farmers and renewable energy producers got much better news from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack,who made another big biofuels announcement on Friday: the USDA’s new $100 million Biofuels Infrastructure Partnership. “USDA’s investments in renewable fuel infrastructure will help us meet future Renewable Fuel Standard targets and lay the ground work for more investments in advanced biofuels,” Senator Stabenow said. “I applaudUSDAfor supporting producers of renewable energyby getting fuels to consumers at the pump.” The USDA’s grants-based initiative is intended to help states develop the market for renewable fuel, particularly higher ethanol blends such as E15 and E85. “American-made, clean energy sources support the environment, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create jobs and sustain the economy in rural communities across the country. We are fortunate that our farmers are producing record amounts of feedstock for these fuels,” Vilsack said. “However, a combination of factors, including lower commodity prices and reduced demand for feed as the poultry industry recovers from highly pathogenic avian influenza, are creating uncertainty for America’s corn and soybean producers. With this partnership, USDA is helping to ensure the infrastructure is in place for consumers to access more renewable fuels, expand marketing opportunities for farmers, and grow America’s rural economies.” Your email address will not be published.

The top two artist renderings depict a more contemporary structure that could be built without a variance, while the lower two barn-style structures would require approval since it is taller but is the preferred design since it would blend better with the rural nature of the community. OREGON TWP. — Some area residents have been keeping a wary eye on the old Thom farm corner of Marathon and Stanley roads ever since the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) announced a year ago June it would build a water treatment plant there to service Genesee County water customers and possibly the City of Lapeer. Some residents, like Ralph and Sandy Baer, are worried how the 80-acre facility and its 125-million gallon reservoir will affect property values in the area. Ralph said they’ve had their house on the market for a year and have already had some potential buyers walk away when they learned what’s planned for kitty-corner to their home. Area residents became even more concerned when a nine-page letter signed by the “Oregon Township Homeowners Association” (OTHA) started appearing on store counters in the area. Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeffrey Wright called the unsigned document a “manifesto,” and told an Oregon Township Hall meeting room full of residents Sunday that it is full of “misinformation.” Wright and several of his staff members came to Oregon Township on Sunday to reassure residents that KWA is going to be a good neighbor. Wright told residents that despite the OTHA letter’s claim that no state Dept. of Environmental Quality (DEQ) study has been done for the plant, the reason KWA didn’t bring a site plan to the township sooner is that the agency just got DEQ and EPA approval four weeks ago. He dismissed concerns about pollution from the plant saying KWA will be pumping water from Lake Huron that’s “clean to begin with” and treating it at the Oregon Township site with “industrial strength bleach” and powdered lime. Wright noted the lime is the same as the lime that local farmers regularly spread on their fields. Wright noted that KWA will be extending a Consumers Energy gas line south from Columbiaville to the site and instead of bringing it into the property at the corner of Marathon and Thom roads, they’re paying an additional $450,000 to extend the line another half-mile south, giving residents on the west side of Marathon Road access to natural gas. Mark Monson, who’s been a vocal critic of the project, wanted to know why KWA could extend the gas line along Stanley Road from Marathon to Klam Road to offer homeowners along the south side of the planned water treatment plant the same perk and pave Stanley Road all the way to Klam and not just the front gate of the water treatment plant. Wright noted that while the OTHA letter demanded that no trees be cut along Stanley Road, if KWA paved the mile-long section of road, the Lapeer County Road Commission would require it to remove all trees from the right-ofway. Matt Lincoln who owns a farm to the north of the site said he’s worried about how run-off will affect his property. Wright said the site will be managed using Genesee County’s water management standards, which are stricter than those of Lapeer County. He said in addition to the 125-million gallon reservoir, KWA will build a series of detention ponds on the site. While the OTHA letter fretted about employee traffic, Wright said the plant will have 10-12 employees coming and going daily and about one large supply truck a month. He said that will be considerably less traffic than the 14 homes that could have been built on the site. Wright said KWA officials will be back in Oregon Township Nov. 18 to seek a number of variances, none of which are needed for the operation of the plant. He said KWA will be seeking approval for a horse barn-like design for the water treatment plant that will exceed the township’s height limitation, but still be shorter than an existing silo on the site. He said KWA is also asking for permission to build a 200-foot tall cell tower instead of an 80-foot tower. According to Wright, the taller tower would improve cell phone and broadband service in much of the township, and the horse barn design will add $1 million to the cost of the project, but fit better with Oregon Township’s rural character than a contemporary design. The horse barn design’s peaked roof and copulas would push the building’s 35-foot height limitation to 50 feet. Wright said KWA will spend “hundreds of thousands of dollars” to plant trees and shrubs on the western third of the site where the water treatment plant will be and the eastern end of the property where the reservoir will be will look like “a big meadow.” He said once the earthwork is down next summer, KWA will replant the area with native plants. He said the heavy construction is expected to begin about the time farmers put their equipment in the field and be done by harvest time. Wright said construction on the site should be complete by mid-2016. Wright promised once the work is done, residents will barely know the plant is there. He invited residents to visit the KWA’s Henderson Road pump station. He said several people have built houses next to it since it was completed. He said in 60 years of operating water treatment plants, Genesee County has never had a problem that endangered its neighbors. Several residents wanted to know what taking 80 acres off the township’s tax roles will do to the township’s bottom line. Oregon Township Treasurer Cheryl Rhein- O’Neill said it would mean a $1,000 loss in revenue. Wright added that fire hydrants KWA will install every half mile along the pipeline should help fire insurance rates of residents. Wright’s assurances still didn’t convince everyone. Lapeer County Clerk Theresa Spencer, whose family has owned property near the planned water treatment plant noted, “There are still a long list of unknowns.” KWA officials will be in front of the Oregon Township Planning Commission at 7 p.m. Nov. 25 for site plan approval.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on September 03, 2014 PORT SANILAC — Heavy clouds and the threat of severe thunderstorms did not deter about 50 people, mostly lakeshore residents, from voicing opposition to the proposed nuclear waste repository slated to be constructed in Kincardine, Ontario, across Lake Huron from the Sanilac County shoreline. The forum, a town hall-style meeting sponsored by state Senators Mike Green and Phil Pavlov, was held Aug. 26 in Port Sanilac’s harbor gazebo. Equipped with easels displaying charts and maps, and with the horizon of Lake Huron as his backdrop, Pavlov, R-St. Clair Twp., explained the nature of the proposed project, telling the audience, “It is a deep burial disposal system for nuclear waste, the by-product of the Kincardine plant’s eight nuclear reactors, which supply nearly 50 percent of Ontario’s electric power. They currently store their waste in above ground containers. The company (Ontario Power Generation) believes they have a safe geologic formation for deep burial even though the site is located less than a mile from the shore of Lake Huron.” State Sen. Phil Pavlov, R-St. Clair Twp., addressed an audience that gathered Tuesday to hear more about efforts to oppose a proposed nuclear waste dump to be located about a mile from Lake Huron on property of an Ontario electric utility company. Lawmakers and citizens are skeptical. “There’s no safe way to dispose of it,” said Casey Ross of Port Sanilac. “Why are we making more?” “I’m concerned with it polluting our Lake Huron and other Great Lakes,” stated Jackie Armstrong of Lakeport. “I didn’t realize it was that close.” Pavlov told the audience, “My concerns and objections center on two things: proximity and permanence. By that I mean, location and method.” Pavlov pointed to a map highlighting the shoreline position of Kincardine in relation to the Canadian landmass of nearly 4 million square miles. “I don’t believe OPG has done due diligence to explore alternatives,” he said. “They haven’t considered other sites.” Pavlov said, “Above ground storage can be dealt with in the event of a problem. Deep burial is permanent. Once it’s down there it’s down there, and nothing can be done to repair it. The ramifications of a potential disaster are far beyond our capabilities to handle it.” Because of economics, there’s less opposition to the proposal in Kincardine, Pavlov said. Ontario Power Generation, which is owned by the Ontario provincial government is Canada’s largest owner of nuclear power plants, and together with its other facilities produces 60 percent of Ontario’s electric power. In 2008, it became one of Canada’s top 100 employers. In 2014 it reported assets of $38 billion with a net income in the second quarter of $116 million. Despite an “equal interest in clean water on the other side of the board,” said Pavlov, “there’s no outrage in Kincardine because of all the economic benefits.” Jerry Lawrence and Jack Noble of Michigan Steelheaders Association reported that they had visited the Kincardine area and met with officials. The men said that they believe that there are “more suitable sites, perhaps in old tin mines about 250 miles to the east. But why would they want to incur the expense of trucking the waste when they could bury it near the plant? It could be a devastating thing in the future.” “Their (the Canadian) government is not very concerned,” said state Rep. Paul Muxlow, R-Brown City. “Fiftythree thousand barrels of nuclear waste…they say it’s secure for 500 years. What about then? It’s not just about us. It’s about the people to come.” In his remarks, state Sen. Mike Green, R-Mayville, pointed to the complexity of dealing with the issue because it is an international problem. “It’s not like we can pass a law in Lansing and stop it.” This prompted an audience member to ask, “How can we as U.S. citizens influence Canada? We have no right to tell them what to do.” Acknowledging Canadian sovereignty, Pavlov said, “It’s about pressure. We’ve passed five pieces of legislation in the state senate. It’s now in the Michigan house.” Pavlov outlined some of what he called “the mechanisms for pressure”. Citing various boards and commissions, such as the International Joint Commission, the Great Lakes Commission, and certain agreements including the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty, and the Great Lakes Compact, Pavlov said these must be employed to bring concerns to Canadian and U.S. authorities. “We must urge President Obama to invoke the powers he has,” stated Pavlov. “And to do this, we really need you. Spread the word through social media. Learn more about it from the website protectlakehuron.com. Sign the online petitions. Hard copies are on the way. “When we finally get an opportunity to speak over there, we want to present your signatures to the Canadian authorities.” Pavlov said, “They are no where near construction yet. Get engaged. It’s not a done deal.” Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on August 20, 2014 LAPEER COUNTY — Calling a nuclear waste dump proposed for Kincardine, Ontario, less than a mile from Lake Huron, “not safe” and “not acceptable,” a contingent of state legislators in late June asked President Barack Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, the U.S. Congress and other parties to intervene and stop the so-called Deep Geologic Repository. With the Blue Water Bridge and the St. Clair River as a backdrop, State Sen. Phil Pavlov, who represents St. Clair and Lapeer counties, State Rep. Dan Lauwers, of Brockway Township, State Sen. Mike Green, of Mayville, and State Rep. Paul Muxlow, of Brown City, held a press conference on May 19 to demand that the proposed dump be scrapped. All the men are Republicans. The Thumb-area lawmakers have announced measures to stop the construction of a Canadian nuclear waste dump and strengthen the state’s protection of natural resources against radioactive waste. Pavlov also announced the creation of an online petition, www.ProtectLakeHuron.com, and encouraged residents throughout the Thumb and the state of Michigan to sign the petition and add their voices to the call for presidential action. “This proposed facility would pose a critical threat to the health of the Great Lakes and other natural resources throughout Michigan,” said Pavlov, R-St. Clair Township. “I take very seriously my duty as a legislator to protect our natural resources and public health. That is why I will continue to fight the development of this site and ask my fellow residents to join in this effort.” Concurrent Senate and House resolutions call on the president, the secretary of state and Congress to take the appropriate procedural steps to submit a letter of reference or request a binding decision from the International Joint Commission (IJC), the official organization appointed to prevent and resolve disputes over the use of the Great Lakes. A second concurrent resolution would urge the Great Lakes Commission to study the impacts of the facility and take a formal position on it. In addition to banning the importation of all radioactive waste, a bill in the package would extend Michigan’s current ban on nuclear waste disposal to include Class C radioactive waste — the most dangerous form of low-level nuclear waste. The bill also would create the Great Lakes Protection Radioactive Waste Advisory Board to assess a broad range of public health, natural resource, cultural, archaeological and historical consequences of the proposed Ontario facility. “I will ask the board to set an aggressive timetable and conduct public hearings on the matter to determine a wide range of potential impacts,” Pavlov said. “This information-gathering effort and the conclusions from the panel can help bring to light key potential risks from the proposed facility and hopefully help to attract additional national and international attention to calling the facility to a halt.” Green, R-Mayville, added, “The Great Lakes are Michigan’s most valuable natural resource, not only for our ecosystem but for our economy as well. Michigan has a long history of protecting this resource and that’s what we are joining together to do today.” Their co-sponsors in the state House joined Pavlov and Green in unveiling this plan. “These measures put the debate into a scientific forum, which allows for public comment,” said state Rep. Paul Muxlow, R-Brown City. “The process should make it clear to everyone that the development of this nuclear waste disposal facility is unacceptable, and I hope it puts significant pressure on the Canadian government to stop their approval of the site.” Tens of millions of United States and Canadian citizens depend on the Great Lakes for drinking water, fisheries, tourism, recreation and other industrial and economic uses. Placing a permanent nuclear waste burial facility in Kincardine, Ontario could lead to a leak or breach of radioactivity from the facility or to a similar pollution incident, which could severely harm the ecology of the Great Lakes, perhaps permanently. “Michigan’s Great Lakes are one of our most prized resources, and we have a responsibility to protect them,” said state Rep. Andrea LaFontaine, R-Columbus. “This legislation does just that. It prioritizes the conservation of our beautiful water and everything that comes with it. With great things comes great responsibility, so let’s step up to the plate and care for the Great Lakes to the best of our ability.” Under the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty, the IJC, made up of individuals appointed from the U.S. and Canada, is authorized to address international matters relative to the U.S. and Canadian interests in protecting the Great Lakes. An important part of the treaty enables either nation to submit a letter of reference to the IJC for their debate, research and investigation regarding issues having the potential to impact the health of the lakes. The concurrent resolutions pertaining to the IJC urge the legislatures and governors in the seven other Great Lakes states to submit the same request for the U.S. to invoke IJC provisions. Pavlov said he will request that the IJC hold hearings in key locations that will be adversely affected by the facility proposed by the Canadian company Ontario Power Generation. The measures have already gained national attention and praise from key conservation groups. “Burying nuclear waste a quarter mile from the Great Lakes is a shockingly bad idea — it poses a serious threat to people, fish, wildlife and the lakes themselves,” said Andy Buchsbaum, regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation’s Great Lakes Regional Center. “We support this legislative package that asks Canada to reconsider its plan to store large amounts of radioactive waste on the shores of Lake Huron. It’s time to go back to the drawing board to find a solution that doesn’t put our Great Lakes, environment, communities and economy at risk.” James Clift, policy director for the Michigan Environmental Council, added, “The unique elements of the project, such as its nearly unprecedented reliance on limestone to contain emissions from nuclear waste and, most notably, the site’s proximity to Lake Huron, demand that Ontario Power Generation (OPG) take seriously its obligation to consider alternative sites. Unfortunately, the process employed and supporting information provided by OPG to this point do not reflect sufficiently careful analysis of alternative sites.” “As we all get ready to take our families boating, swimming and fishing in the Great Lakes this summer, the implications of this proposed project are really brought home,” said Erin McDonough, executive director of the Michigan United Conservation Clubs. “We appreciate the leadership Senator Pavlov and his legislative partners are showing in proactively addressing the serious issue of burying nuclear waste along Lake Huron’s shoreline.” Your email address will not be published.

 Breaking News: Four COVID-19 patients pass away today in Lapeer County By ohtadmin | on August 17, 2014 Sen. Carl Levin Sen. Carl Levin Editor’s note: The following guest column was written by Sen. Carl Levin. Levin is the senior U.S. senator from Michigan and co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force. In July, the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held a hearing on the Great Lakes Ecological and Economic Protection Act, which I introduced along with a bipartisan group of eight Senate cosponsors, including Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, my co-chair on the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, and Michigan’s Sen. Debbie Stabenow. This legislation would help restore and protect the Great Lakes, the largest source of surface freshwater on the planet. It would target the most significant problems facing the Great Lakes and ensure that we implement these projects cost-effectively. The Great Lakes are one of the world’s great treasures, providing drinking water to more than 40 million people; supporting 1.5 million U.S. jobs and $62 billion in wages; transporting critical supplies for manufacturing, electricity generation and food for the world; and supporting the region’s $4.6 trillion economy. The Great Lakes brought industrial and natural resource development to the region, which resulted in tremendous economic development and population growth. This development, however, also resulted in toxic substances polluting the waters and sediments, untreated wastewater threatening public health, and polluted runoff choking habitats and killing aquatic life. The recent toxic algae bloom on Lake Erie that cut off drinking water to a half a million residents is just one example of how much we depend on our lakes. The Great Lakes Ecological and Economic Protection Act, also known as GLEEPA, would tackle problems from past pollution and protect the lakes from current and future threats. GLEEPA would formally authorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, an inter-agency program launched by President Obama in 2009 to implement a regional collaboration strategy developed in 2005 through a process established in an executive order by President George W. Bush. The history of the restoration strategy clearly shows the work of restoring and protecting the Great Lakes is founded on a plan that reflects a broad range of viewpoints and has strong bipartisan support. GLEEPA would focus federal resources on the areas of highest priority identified in the collaborative plan, which would be further refined as new science and information become available. While the GLRI is broadly authorized in the Clean Water Act, passing this legislation would help ensure the program has clear congressional direction and goals, is results-driven and transparent, and implements the most cost-effective solutions. The bill would also formally establish the Great Lakes Advisory Board to provide advice and recommendations concerning restoration and protection. The board would reflect many different viewpoints, including local, state and tribal governments; environmental, agricultural and business organizations; hunters and anglers; and academia. Finally, the bill would formally establish a 10-member interagency task force to coordinate restoration efforts, ensure projects are not duplicated and that they use existing successful programs. GLEEPA also would accelerate progress toward the goals of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, a formal agreement between the U.S. and Canadian governments establishing shared goals for protecting and improving water quality of the Great Lakes. The GLRI has achieved real progress: cleanup of more than 1.3 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment; control of the destructive sea lamprey and restoration of sturgeon, trout and other important fish species; construction and improvement of barriers to prevent an invasion by destructive Asian carp, and planning for additional measures to keep these fish out of the lakes; protection of tens of thousands of vital habitat acreage; and restoration of thousands of miles of rivers for fish passage. GLEEPA would help ensure that progress continues to be made using a solid framework for achieving measurable and outcome-based results. The Great Lakes are precious and irreplaceable. As temporary stewards of this invaluable resource, we must do all we can to restore and protect the Great Lakes for the millions of people who depend on them today and the millions more who will in the future. I’m glad the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee held an important hearing on this vital legislation, and I’m hopeful it can receive approval from the full committee and move on to a vote in the Senate.
