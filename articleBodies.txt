 The Midland Daily News This column will be a little different than the usual approach that I take. I read an interesting commentary about an interview taken from Medcape Family Medicine, July 14, 2016, with Robert D. Brook, MD, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Michigan and Director of the Hypertension Center there. Dr. Brook is from Michigan and does research on the effects of air pollution. He said he was sitting on the beach in the late 1990s with his brother who is an atmospheric scientist. Dr. Brook thought the haze he saw on the horizon, while looking over Lake Michigan, was “sea haze.” His brother explained to him, however, that it was pollution causing the foggy atmosphere. It piqued Dr. Brook’s interest and so began his lifelong research into the effects of pollution on healthcare. As with most of us, Dr. Brook thought the major problem with air pollution was that it caused lung problems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other issues like these. Research has shown, however, that the majority of health effects from air pollution are adverse cardiovascular events. This includes heart attacks, strokes, heart failure and sudden death. Air pollution is the ninth leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. Air pollution in defined in terms of fine PM. A PM 2.5 means particles that are less than 2.5 µm in diameter. They result from fossil fuel combustion (coal, gas, etc.), mobile sources such as traffic, or the energy industry in the modern world. The PM for a particular size is then measured in weight/m3. In the United States, the average PM 2.5 is about 10 µg/m3. In comparison, PM levels in a smoky bar are about 500 µg/m3. A little bit confusing but just compare the numbers while reading below. For the last few years, the United States has gone down from levels of 25 to 30 µg/m3 in the 1970s and 1980s to an average level of 10 µg/m3 now. This dramatic reduction has translated into an improvement in all-cause mortality leading to a six- to seven-month increase in life expectancy on average in the United States. (I thought that was pretty impressive!) However, close to 25 percent of Americans are still exposed to levels above the World Health Organization standards of 10µg/m3. Many such areas are next to roadways or in urban industrial locations. People in Asia, particularly China and India, are exposed to far higher levels of pollution than we now are. These are also the areas where cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are escalating dramatically. It is interesting to note that second-hand smoke levels are around 500 µg/m3. One cigarette delivers well over 5000 to 10,000 µg/m3. One cigarette is comparable to a month’s worth of exposure to air pollution in Beijing, China! So how does air pollution trigger the cardiovascular/heart problems? Extensive research has shown different ways. Pollutants injure the lining of the blood vessels, they cause the blood vessels to constrict and narrow, and the platelets in the blood which are involved in clotting become more sensitized and clot more easily. This all leads to more clots in the vessels (strokes and heart attacks) and arrhythmias in the heart (sudden death). (I’m simplifying this significantly!) Then the next question is: How do the pollutants do these things? For those of you who have read this column regularly, you have learned that it appears that inflammation is the first step in the cascade of events that cause strokes, heart attacks, cancer and dementia. Reduce inflammation and you reduce all of these major killers. It turns out that when the lung inhales pollution particles, the lung tissue becomes inflamed. The inflammation isn’t just isolated to the lungs, but rather inflammatory chemicals throughout the body are increased. Subsequently, the inflammation causes vascular and cardiovascular tissue to be inflamed, causing constricting of the vessels, as well as the clotting and buildup of atheroscleratic plaques. Interesting! Inflammation is the culprit once again. Many of us have heard about inflammation around the gums (gingivitis) causing heart disease. It’s part of the same story. Gingivitis causes significant inflammation which generalizes throughout the body. It is the chemicals that cause inflammation that lead to the major problems of strokes, heart attacks, cancer, and dementia. A second way that air pollution leads to heart problems is that the lung can sense these foreign particles and promote rapid changes in the body’s chemistry. It’s sort of the “flight or fight” response. Our body surges with various hormonal chemicals when it feels “attacked” and that leads to an increase in blood pressure, constriction of blood vessels, and heart arrhythmias. The final way that the pollution affects the heart and blood vessels is that the very chemicals causing the pollution are toxic in themselves. Those chemicals are absorbed through the lungs and have a direct effect on various body tissues. There are thousands of very fine particles of organic chemicals and metals in pollution. Cigarette smoke is a convenient way to deliver nicotine into the body, but the air we breathe delivers many of those other chemicals also. If scientists can detect these bodily responses to short term exposures to pollutants, imagine what happens over the long term. Think of the adverse effects on the body’s systems. We must remember that pollution is not the only factor causing heart and lung problems. Diet, obesity and exercise all play a role. But when you add on pollution, the effects multiply. One final thing in the interview was discussion of the mask that you see many Asians wearing when they are in the major cities. Do they filter out pollution? Mostly the masks being worn are simple surgical masks that protect people from respiratory droplets. They aren’t made to protect us from the fine particles in air. China and the rest of Asia are often exposed to PM levels between 100 to 500 µg/m3 (10 to 50 times what the average level is in the United States). There is some evidence showing that home air filters or purifications systems with HEPA filters do reduce exposures and lead to improved health. Research is ongoing. So, as I noted, this is a little different approach to my usual column, but rather interesting stuff, isn’t it? Dr. John L. Pfenninger’s column appears on Sundays. His office, Medical Procedures Center, is located in Midland.

 By EMERY P. DALESIO RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina judge said Friday he wants to review a surprise deal settling decades of groundwater pollution at Duke Energy's coal ash pits because he questioned the motives behind the company's deal with state environmental regulators. The deal reduced the $25 million fine at a Wilmington power plant that state regulators had promoted as the largest penalty for environmental damage in state history. The agreement cut the fine to $7 million but also sought to resolve groundwater pollution claims at all 14 of the company's power plants storing toxic coal ash, not just one. The judge who signed off on the settlement last fall went too far with his order that seemed to close lawsuits involving conservation groups, Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway said. "It is a bit surprising that in a penalty case over one plant, it developed into as comprehensive a settlement as this," Ridgeway said. The Department of Environmental Quality could decide the appropriate fine for Duke Energy polluting the groundwater at its Sutton power plant, Ridgeway said. But because Administrative Law Judge Phil Berger Jr. wasn't asked to rewrite the scope of his order approving the deal, Ridgeway said he suspected the settlement's language was designed to close the courtroom door to environmental groups or others. "I have to suspect that there is some ulterior motive," he said. The parties later agreed to ask Berger to revise his order, Duke Energy spokeswoman Erin Culbert said. Berger is the son of state Senate leader Phil Berger. The Republican's district includes Eden, site of a 2014 spill of toxic coal ash that prompted a new law requiring Duke Energy to clean up its coal ash holding pits by 2029. State water quality officials knew for years about the contamination at Sutton's unlined ash pits but took no enforcement action until August 2013 — after a citizens groups tried to sue Duke Energy. Monitoring wells near Duke's dumps at Sutton showed readings exceeding state groundwater standards for chemicals including boron and thallium, which was used in rat poison until it was banned because it is highly toxic. The hearing came on the day DEQ signed off for the first time on plans to drain the water off the top of basins where coal ash is collected, a needed step to closing, excavating or covering them. The state permit for work at Duke Energy's Riverbend power plant in Mount Holly is intended to be a model for documents needed to close coal ash pits around the state. It allows water to be diverted to rivers and streams until 3 feet of water remains above the ash. Duke Energy will be required to test fish near the discharge site to see whether their bodies contain collected mercury or lead, and twice a year test the waterway for those heavy metals and arsenic, chromium and cadmium. ___ Follow Emery P.

url: https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Dow-Chemical-Nature-Conservancy-explore-using-6934589.php
 The Associated Press FREEPORT, Texas (AP) — Before Houston and its suburbs were built, a dense forest naturally purified the air along a stretch of the Texas Gulf Coast that grew thick with pecan, ash, live oak and hackberry trees. It was the kind of pristine woodland that was mostly wiped out by settlers in their rush to clear land and build communities. Now one of the nation’s largest chemical companies and one of its oldest conservation groups have forged an unlikely partnership that seeks to recreate some of that forest to curb pollution. The plan drafted by The Dow Chemical Co. and the Nature Conservancy is only in its infancy and faces many hurdles. But it envisions a day when expensive machines used to capture industrial pollutants might be at least partially replaced by restoring some of the groves of native trees that once filled the land. “It looks very promising at the early stage of the research,” said Mark Weick, director of sustainability programs for Dow. “But for this to become something that is an emission control, everyone needs to know it works.” Many plants, and especially trees, capture pollution naturally when it hits their leaves. Trees with the biggest leaves and the widest canopies capture the most pollutants, especially nitrogen oxide, a common byproduct of combustion that can irritate lungs and contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone. The reforestation proposal imagines emissions from Dow’s largest North American factory drifting downwind into the trees near Freeport, Texas. Dow and the Nature Conservancy began a six-year, $10 million collaboration in 2011, when they came together to look at ways natural resources could be used to save the company money. After reading an obscure notation by the federal Environmental Protection Agency that suggested reforestation could improve air quality, the two groups decided to research how the idea might work and whether it could be cost-effective. Scientists used a complex model from the U.S. Forest Service that considers everything from wind patterns to the size of tree leaves and the overall canopy to estimate the air-quality improvements that might come from 1,000 acres of forest. “The big discovery was that you could combine the traditional infrastructure with reforestation and still meet regulation,” said Laura Huffman, the conservancy’s director in Texas. The trees, Huffman said, may not completely replace traditional technology, but they could complement it, allowing factories to use smaller, cheaper equipment. The research found that over 30 years a 1,000-acre forest would remove 4 to 7 tons of nitrogen oxide annually, said Timm Kroeger, a senior environmental economist with the conservancy. A traditional mechanical “scrubber” removes about 50 to 70 tons annually. So a 10,000-acre forest equals one average industrial scrubber, he explained. And in this part of Texas, where open land is ample, reforestation is within reach. The cost of the project not including the land would be about the same as using traditional forms of pollution control, Weick said. Organizers hope to work with a landowner interested in reforesting, probably with help from conservation tax credits. Or the Nature Conservancy or the federal government would buy the land and give it to Dow free of charge. A recent progress report determined that the cost of cleaning a ton of nitrogen oxide through reforestation was $2,400 to $4,000, compared with $2,500 to $5,000 using traditional equipment. The research is still being reviewed by other scientists. And before any formal plan could be adopted, it would have to win approval from state and federal regulators, who would require any pollution-cleansing method to be quantifiable and enforceable. Trees may not fit the bill. Unlike machines, they are living organisms that are subject to diseases, droughts and other threats such as hurricanes or fires. Back in 2005, another scientific group researched a similar idea and decided it would not pay off. “The conclusion that we reached was that what they were trying to do was difficult and that the degree of uncertainty was larger than the benefits,” said Mark Estes, a senior air quality scientist with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Even if it wins broad support, the plan won’t be approved anytime soon. In Texas, it can take up to four years to change clean-air rules. And that’s before any proposal moves up to the EPA. As he looked out over land ripe for reforestation, Jeff Wiegel, the conservancy’s director of strategic initiatives in Texas, was realistic about the pace of progress. “It’s a long road toward that,” he said.

 The Dow Chemical Co. will pay to clean up six areas of contaminated sediment in the Tittabawassee River as part of a new agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The pollution is in the three-mile stretch of the river that is adjacent to Dow’s Michigan Operations site. It is the first segment in what the EPA expects to be a series of upstream-to-downstream cleanup projects. Unlike high levels of dioxin found in other areas of the river, this segment contains arsenic, chlorobenzenes, chlorophenols and more that were released by Dow. In three of the six areas, cleanup also will take place for dense non-aqueous phase liquid, or DNAPL, which the EPA said is a heavy liquid made up of materials that do not mix with water and sink to the bottom of the river. The planned work and previously released cost estimates are as follows: • Area 1: Place a clean cap over contaminated sediment to isolate and stabilize the sediment. Cost: $250,000. • Areas 2 and 3: Remove and treat DNAPL, isolate contaminated sediment with sheet pile and a cap and capture water within the sediment and treat it. Cost: $1.8 million. • Areas 4 and 5: Place a clean cap over contaminated sediment to prevent erosion. Cost: $600,000. • Area 6: Dredge and dispose of sediment contaminated by ethyl parathion; remove and treat DNAPL; isolate remaining contaminated sediment with sheet pile and a cap; and capture water within the sediment and treat it. Cost: $3.1 million. “Materials will be treated and disposed at approved locations, sites will be monitored during and after the cleanup and the cleanup systems will operate and be maintained,” the EPA stated in an e-mail announcing the new agreement. Mary Logan, EPA remedial project manager, previously said the cleanup would prevent chemicals on the surface from harming small invertebrates or contaminating areas downstream if the sediment was disturbed. Dow spokeswoman Mary Draves said the company remains focused on moving toward a resolution. “Now that the plan for segment 1 has been finalized we will begin to conduct work as outlined in the agreement,” Draves said in an e-mail. “This, along with other work we have conducted, is part of our continued work with both the EPA and MDEQ towards progress on implementation of our agreement.” Visit www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/dowchemical for more information about the Superfund site.

 Tony Lascariof the Daily News Replacing contaminated soil, cleaning homes and paving roads in Saginaw's Riverside Boulevard neighborhood are all meant to prevent residents from being exposed to dioxins and furans. But, it's possible the work will need to be repeated in the future because the Tittabawassee River regularly floods the area containing 11 homes. The Dow Chemical Co. and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed to cleanup work in July, and officials involved recognize there are limitations. "It's going to reflood; it's going to recontaminate to some extent," said Al Taylor, a Michigan Department of Environmental Quality geologist. It is unclear how fast, and at what level, contamination will return, Taylor said. He said previous cleanup sites have varied from having little to "significant" recontamination following flooding. A monitoring system needs to be developed to make sure contamination levels do not rise to current levels, Taylor said. He said action would have to be taken if levels rise to where they become a problem again. With work taking place to remove contamination upriver of the neighborhood, officials hope recontamination can be prevented. Dow's 1,900-acre chemical manufacturing plant in Midland was a source of dioxins and furans, which are byproducts from the manufacture of chlorine-based products. Dow spokesman John Musser has said the contamination found in the Saginaw neighborhood is thought to have been the result of releases from pre-World War I operations. Jeff Kimble, on scene coordinator with EPA Region 5, said the houses are unique because they regularly flood, as opposed to other houses along the river that generally are built above the floodplain. Detailed sampling of the neighborhood was triggered by one initial sample that contained 5,900 parts per trillion of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds. The testing found more than 10,000 parts per trillion in surface soils in the neighborhood. Kimble said samples taken indoors indicate the contaminants are being tracked indoors. In the yards, two feet of soil will be removed from the riverbank to Riverside Boulevard and replaced with fresh soil and vegetation. The dirt road, which creates dust in dry periods, will be paved. "Dow has been steadfastly working out there," Kimble said, with a goal of finishing by Oct. 15. Four other areas of concern that have a higher priority for the EPA also are being examined to determine contamination levels in residential soil. Kimble said those properties do not have houses as close to the floodplain, like the Riverside Drive neighborhood does.

 JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer France, stung by oil tanker disasters that soiled its seas and beaches, is moving to protect one its most precious maritime resources _ the Mediterranean _ with stiff new punishments for polluters. The measures, adopted last week by the French parliament in a rare show of unanimity, will create an environmental protection zone off southern France's Mediterranean coast, whose sun-drenched waters and beaches draw hordes of tourists every year. World Wildlife Fund oceanographer Denis Ody welcomed the effort but said France must strengthen policing in the Mediterranean to make it effective. "This law is a good idea but will work only if accompanied by the financial and human means to have it taken seriously," he said Monday from the southern port city of Marseille. The measures, which President Jacques Chirac is expected to sign soon, are directed at shippers deliberately dumping oil, garbage and other pollutants in the Mediterranean. It seeks to punish them even when they are outside French territorial waters. Under the law, France will create an ecological protection zone extending up to 90 miles from its Mediterranean coast. France says it does not need the approval of neighboring countries to implement the new measures, though other Mediterranean nations it has contacted generally welcomed the idea. The Mediterranean is a major world shipping route linking the Atlantic Ocean with the Suez Canal. About a quarter of global oil traffic goes through the Mediterranean, according to French government figures. In 1999, the sinking of a 25-year-old tanker called the Erika spilled 3 million gallons of oil that washed up on France's Atlantic beaches. Another oil spill last year off northwestern Spain added urgency to French and European efforts to tighten maritime safety laws. The Prestige disgorged millions of gallons of oil when it broke up and sank in November, polluting Spanish and French coasts and shutting down fisheries. But French authorities say the washing out of ballast, oil and fuel tanks, the dumping of garbage at sea and similar practices cause more pollution than shipping accidents. "It's this deliberate pollution that is the main target" of the new measures, said Tokia Saifi, France's secretary of state for sustainable development, when she presented the proposals to lawmakers Thursday. Ships flush their tanks at sea because it is cheaper and quicker than doing so in port, and because few ports have tank-washing facilities, Ody said. Studies suggest 225 million gallons of oil and fuel are flushed into the Mediterranean each year this way, he said. "It's a chronic problem," Ody said. Captains of ships caught washing out oil tanks in the zone risk fines of up to $600,000. Their vessels could be seized until the fine is paid, French government officials said. Captains of French ships caught polluting the zone also risk up to four years in prison. The government expects the law to take effect before the summer, when sun-loving tourists descend on Mediterranean beaches en masse.

 DAVE BRYAN Associated Press Writer David Baker remembers the upheaval in his hometown of Anniston in the 1990s when many residents realized their health and property had been contaminated by toxic PCBs from a nearby chemical plant. The experience spurred Baker and others in predominantly poor, black west Anniston to form Community Against Pollution to fight for damages and clean up the contamination. Today, most of the group's members have been involved in lawsuits against the chemical company. "It was just something you could not believe in these days and times to see the people who suffered behind this," Baker recalled. Like Baker, citizens in many poor, black communities around Alabama and the South in recent years have fought companies who have located pollution-spewing industrial plants, hazardous landfills and waste incinerators near homes and schools. Known as "environmental racism," the practice of locating such toxic operations near politically powerless blacks has been stymied by the emerging citizen groups. "Companies now don't just bully in," said Robert Bullard, sociology professor at Clark Atlanta University. "When they do, they're in for a rude awakening. There is no path of least resistance any more." Bullard, author of "Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class and Environmental Quality," said many members of watchdog groups are involved in lawsuits seeking massive damage judgments. Over time, as low-income neighborhoods in Southern towns became more racially mixed, poor people, white and black, joined in the fight, Bullard said. They often run up against business and civic leaders working to develop communities economically. To the developers, such projects often bring in badly needed jobs and revenues for areas that sometimes have little of either. Larry Lee, a spokesman for a company that reopened a landfill in east Alabama last year, said many supported the project, which brought about 35 jobs to a rural community in Tallapoosa County. But in 2000, a company that planned to build Alabama's biggest solid waste landfill withdrew its proposal after the Rev. Jesse Jackson joined residents to oppose the dump in predominantly black and poor Macon County. The landfill would have covered 700 to 800 acres near the town of Shorter and accepted up to 5,000 tons of trash a day from around the South. But Milton McGregor, a white who is a dog track magnate and property owner, withdrew the application after meeting with Jackson and other leaders, and a day before the county commission was to vote on it. Bullard said environmental racism has its roots in the segregationist era in the South when racially segregated schools were legal and building paved roads or parks in black communities was optional. As the New South began to take shape following World War II, politicians in many Southern towns wanted to create jobs and bring in tax revenues to grow local economies. "In many cases (the South) would accept things that other regions would say no to," Bullard said. "Race was a major player in determining where these facilities went in and how they were operated." Many companies moved projects such as waste incinerators and petrochemical plants out of the crowded Northeast. Typical was Sumter County in Alabama, where the nation's largest hazardous waste landfill was built at Emelle in 1978. The 3,200-acre waste treatment, storage and disposal facility came to the predominantly black county during a period when few blacks held public office there. The disposal site, run by Waste Management Inc., created jobs in the area, but it received some of the most hazardous wastes from Superfund sites in the United States and from foreign countries. It handled nearly 800,000 tons of hazardous waste at its peak in 1989 until state officials began to see its negative impact. The state imposed higher taxes on waste shipments and fewer PCB-contaminated materials were sent as tonnage dropped. In the early 1990s an awareness of environmental racism arose among community activists and academics, said Bullard. He said Louisiana in particular became a "hotbed" of environmental racism lawsuits, with many communities along the Mississippi River serving as sites for incinerators and petrochemical plants. In the mid-1990s, the Japanese company, Shintech Inc., wanted to build a $700 million plastics plant in St. James Parish. But parish residents got help from student attorneys at Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. Shintech eventually scaled down the plan to $250 million, and moved it to Plaquemine. In rural Lowndes County, one of the poorest in the country, efforts to build a 230-acre solid waste landfill near the historic Selma-to-Montgomery National Historic Trail are on hold because of community outrage. County commissioners approved the project on land owned by Waste Management Inc. But Lowndes County Citizens United for Action sued to halt construction, contending in part it was wrong to put a waste disposal site near the highways where marchers helped inspire the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The case is making its way through the courts. The mainly black county residents had support from the mainly white residents of Lowndesboro. "Twelve jobs _ come on," said Barbara Evans, who heads the community group. "Twelve jobs for a dump on the … historic civil rights trial." Evans said with roughly 250 types of landfills in the state, including 29 that take in more than 32,000 tons of waste daily, Alabama doesn't need new landfills to handle its trash. "I think Alabama is being targeted and I think especially the communities of color and low-income neighborhoods are being targeted," she said.

 Ralph E. Wirtz of the Daily News If you are a little younger, you still would have seen some of the tanks and the smokestacks, but the wording on the side would have changed. You would have seen "Total" emblazoned across the white metal. Today, you can still see some of the tanks and some of the smokestacks, even though the plant closed two years ago. But they are going fast, as are the remnants of what used to be a thriving industry in this Gratiot County city. Including, the residents hope, the pollution. The pollution is what you wouldn't have seen had you been driving through Alma - the oil slowly seeping toward the groundwater through the earth, or the sludge that accumulated on the bottom of Horse Creek, a tributary of the Pine River used for outflow from the Total refinery waste ponds. Some people noticed, although few outside Chicago, Lansing or the immediate area. For the past eight years, investigations have revealed large amounts of pollution in the ground, water and air surrounding the plant site. The investigations have resulted in a $4 million fine and a $9 million cleanup project for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock - the latest owner of the property. The stories of the cleanups along the river between Alma and St. Louis are intertwined, much like the histories of the two cities. They both grew in fits and starts, counting logging and agriculture as the first wave of industry, heavy manufacturing in the early 1900s as the second and growth of two distinct industries as the third. The chemical industry in St. Louis began in 1935, when the Michigan Chemical Co. began taking brine from the ground near the area's mineral springs, turning it into bromides and salt. Crystal Flow salt was a hot item in area grocery stores. As Michigan Chemical grew, it began producing methyl, ethyl bromides, magnesia, DDT, antihistamines and analgesics, and the waste from these processes went right into the river. People then didn't know what they do now about controlling pollution and there were few laws and regulations to force them to comply. In the middle of the century, if a reactor overflowed, it was allowed to just spill onto the ground, according to Jack Bails, who was chief of the Environmental Law Enforcement Division of the Department of Natural Resources beginning in 1976. "If people had a liquid they wanted to get rid of, they would just take it to the back 40," he said. "It was common practice at a lot of chemical manufacturing facilities." Ron Orwig, who now lives in Mount Pleasant, worked 13 years for Michigan Chemical. He agrees, citing one incident from 1974 or 1975. "I remember a hydrochloric acid tank, I don't know how many thousands of gallons were in it, that was being pumped, and whoever was pumping it forgot to open up the valve, and they sucked the bottom out of the tank. All that acid went right into the river." Even when the companies were abiding by the rules, the weak environmental laws of that time allowed problems to brew. "In the late 1970s, it became pretty obvious that disposal practices at chemical manufacturers were a major problem," Bails said. Sean Horne, project manager for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. is in charge of tearing down the last of the refineries which dominated the Alma landscape since Mid-West Refinery opened its doors in 1934. Shortly thereafter, three other refineries - Leonard, Wolverine and Northern - opened after the Durbin Gusher was discovered in the Mount Pleasant oilfields in 1935. Another - the McClanahan Refinery -opened in St. Louis but was bought by Leonard in 1938 and moved into Leonard's operation. Wolverine and Northern closed shortly thereafter. Alma's two remaining refineries kept employment steady until Mid-West was purchased by Leonard in 1966 and closed. In the early 1970s, Leonard was purchased by the French oil company Total and operated until 1999, when it closed. Sixty years of putting pollutants into area waterways overwhelmed the system, and now community members and officials are taking the steps to clean it. In St. Louis, the Environmental Protection Agency has named the river a Superfund site and is taking out sediments that read as high as 34,000 parts per million DDT, along with high levels of polybrominated biphenyls and hexabromobenzene. In addition, Scott Cornelius of the Environmental Response Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is seeking to correct a problem at the Michigan Chemical plant site that threatens the cleanup. In Alma, the EPA came to an agreement with UDS to put $9 million toward the cleanup of petroleum pollutants from Horse Creek and the Pine River. Jim Sygo, chief of the Waste Management Division of MDEQ, said more will be spent, if needed, to bring the waterway and other contaminated areas "to the satisfaction of the state and state guidelines." State officials thought they had the problem solved in St. Louis in 1982, when the state, the Environmental Protection Agency and Velsicol Chemical Co., which purchased Michigan Chemical Co. in the 1970s, signed an agreement to cap the 54-acre plant site and contain any pollutants there. In the agreement, no action was taken on the pollutants in the river, and officials today say they believed at the time that sediments would cover the pollution, keeping it out of the food chain. "At that time, that's what we thought," Bails said. Unfortunately, they were wrong.

 LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer Environmental groups criticized Israel on Tuesday for a plan to dump treated factory wastewater into the Mediterranean Sea. For decades, factories have been discharging untreated waste into the Kishon River, which empties into the Mediterranean at Haifa Bay north of Tel Aviv. But the Environment Ministry banned the practice beginning Tuesday. As part of a master plan to clean up the polluted river, a bypass pipe would be built to carry factory wastewater with certain types of salts directly to the sea. Environmental groups said the ministry had failed to research possible harm to plant and animal life in the sea. "There are organic wastes, poisons and metals in that water," said Sharon Shemesh-Rosenbaum, a spokeswoman for the Israeli branch of Greenpeace. "We don't trust the factories to let only salts flow through the pipe into the sea." The ministry said it is studying the environmental affect to determine the length of the bypass and a best location to minimize harm to the sea. Officials believe "releasing the effluent into the depths of the sea will not damage the quality of the sea water," a ministry statement said. About 700,000 cubic feet of untreated water were being dumped daily into the Kishon River. As of Tuesday, all wastewater must be treated before it is discharged. The push to clean up the Kishon began in 2000 when it was revealed that 40 out of 750 divers of an elite navy unit, who had carried out diving exercises in the river, contracted cancer. The Kishon River and Haifa Bay are lined with chemical factories, which have been dumping their waste into the waterway for decades. Greenpeace also criticized Israel for allowing the heavy pollution of the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv, which also flows into the Mediterranean Sea. ___ On the Net: Ministry of Environment: http://www.sviva.gov.il// Greenpeace Mediterranean: http://www.greenpeacemed.org.mt/

 Breaking News: Gov. Whitmer orders non-essential businesses to suspend in-person operations until at least April 13 By oht_editor | on August 11, 2019 REP. PAUL MITCHELL Editor’s note: Congressman Paul Mitchell, R-Dryden Township recently sent the letter below to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer regarding a proposed gravel mine on the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property in Metamora Township, which is adjacent to the Metamora Landfill Superfund site. Mitchell represents the 10th Congressional District that includes Lapeer County. Dear Gov. Whitmer, I write to express serious concerns about a proposed gravel mine on the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property in Metamora Township. This property is adjacent to the Metamora Landfill Superfund site (“site”) and the impacts this project could have on the local community and groundwater are severe. This issue was initially brought to my attention by my constituents and local stakeholders. At issue is the status of monitoring wells that track the extent and movement of contaminated groundwater emanating from the site, which is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Through multiple discussions and letters expressing these concerns to the EPA, I learned that the responsible parties had not fully complied with a July 2015 order to expand the monitoring wells around the landfill. It is troubling there is not yet a complete monitoring well network in place, especially when there is a proposed development nearby that is likely to heavily use groundwater. On July 16, 2019, after receiving my letters and listening to community concerns, the EPA directed the responsible parties to further revise the Investigation Work Plan to require a more comprehensive strategy to determine the extent of contamination from the landfill and where it is going. That work is still in progress. The EPA continues to address the contamination emanating from the federally regulated site. As they do so, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) must ensure they strictly monitor and study any proposed projects — such as the one at the D-Bar-A Boy Scout property — thoroughly and impartially. The EPA notes in their letter that EGLE would be the primary agency responsible for oversight of large quantity water withdrawals related to mining projects. The EPA has pledged to communicate with EGLE directly about the site, but I also encourage your office to be receptive to our constituents’ concerns about the proposed mine and its impacts. In addition to environmental issues related to the Superfund site, I also want to note my concern and dismay about the influence state-level lobbyists have exerted over state agencies on matters related to gravel mines. As you are surely aware, proponents of opening additional gravel mines in the state through preemption of local control are using a study produced by the Michigan Dept. of Transportation (MDOT) to advance their position. While there is a case to be made for gravel mine development at a general level, any related decisions should be made objectively, openly, and fairly, with feedback and input from all involved parties. That does not seem to be the case with the study in question. Recent media reports revealed evidence that gravel industry lobbyists made substantial and substantive efforts to direct the MDOT staff working on that taxpayer funded study toward the preferred conclusion of mining proponents. The new MDOT Director Paul Ajegba — whom you appointed — rightfully called for an audit of the contracting practices used for that study. As you work to meet the state’s infrastructure needs, I encourage your administration to maintain the principles of local control, impartial governance, and sound science. I look forward to working with your office, EGLE, and other state and federal agencies to ensure that any developments around the Metamora Landfill Superfund site do not endanger human health or pollute our groundwater. For ease of reference, enclosed please find my correspondence to and from the EPA. I encourage you and your Administration to review these materials and listen to all feedback on this issue. Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter.

 Breaking News: Gov. Whitmer orders non-essential businesses to suspend in-person operations until at least April 13 By oht_editor | on March 27, 2019 The Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP) recently held a 5,000th Verification Celebration in Lansing, highlighting the success of the voluntary program that has helped Lapeer County farms prevent and minimize pollution risks. The milestone represents the work and investment of more than 2,000 producers and agricultural and conservation partners across the state. As a longtime supporter, Michigan Farm Bureau (MFB) and county Farm Bureau members played a significant role in the program’s development, implementation and growth over its first two decades. A turning point for the program — and when the goal was set to reach 5,000 verifications — came in 2011, when legislation supported by MFB and sponsored by now-Senator Kevin Daley, R-Arcadia Township and former Senator Joe Hune, was signed into law. The Lapeer Conservation District has been instrumental in the verification of many dozens of farms in recent years — and that’s good news to the entire county, whether you live on a neighboring farm or miles down the road because the result is a better and healthier environment for all residents. The County Press in our keepsake Progress 2019 edition (March 3) showcased the achievements of local MAEAP verifications. MAEAP is a voluntary environmental program that works individually with farmers to identify and prevent environmental risks on farms that could result in groundwater or surface water contamination. The program evaluates various aspects of farms based on four systems: Farmstead, cropping, livestock, and forest, wetlands and habitat. After mitigating risks on the farm associated with one of the systems, MDARD staff visit the farm to verify the implementation of practices and verify the farm as meeting the program standards. Sen. Daley attended the March 21 event and reflected on the program. “MAEAP helps farmers to be better environmental stewards of their land and is a great example of how the agricultural community, environmental groups, and the government can work together to better the industry,” Daley said. “The 5000th MAEAP verification is a great accomplishment and I am proud to see the success of this program.” A fifth-generation farmer, Lapeer County and Michigan are fortunate to have Daley working on behalf of the agriculture community. He was first elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2009 and represented the 82nd District until 2014, when term limits prevented him from seeking another term. As one of the few farmers in the House at the time, he was the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. In 2018, he was elected to represent the 31st state Senate District, which includes Lapeer, Tuscola and Bay counties. He now serves as chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and is well versed in how MAEAP works. His farm, Daley Acres, is MAEAP verified — as is the Howell Farm owned by Rep. Gary Howell, R-Deerfield Township. Howell and his son, John, operate the farm. Howell has been a member of the Farm Bureau for 34 years, receiving the 2005 Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award. Daley has served on the Lapeer County Farm Bureau Board of Directors, Lapeer County Ag. Preservation Board, and is the former president of the Tri-County Michigan Milk Producers Association. Lapeer County is unique to be served by lawmakers in both Chambers, the House and the Senate, with deep and personal agricultural roots to this community who want the countryside to be free of agricultural pollutants for generations to come. The Lapeer Conservation District, a proud partner of MAEAP with Lapeer County’s legislators, for more than 70 years has worked with local landowners, farmers, governmental agencies, and other organizations to deal with environmental problems. The district board meets at the District Office at 700 South Main St. in Lapeer, Suite 120-C. Meetings are held on the third Thursday of each month at 8 a.m. The public is encouraged to attend.

 By Chevall Pryce A group of local stakeholders continues working to identify, measure and mitigate direct causes of water pollution in Cypress Creek. The Cypress Creek Watershed Partnership whose members include local government figures, business owners and residents, began hosting public meetings earlier this year to spread the partnership’s message and form a steering committee. The 11-member committee is overseeing the creation of a watershed protection plan, or WPP, to reduce the amount of water pollution within Cypress Creek. Related: Community-led committee to work on fixing Cypress Creek water quality On Nov. 14 and 19, the CCWP hosted work group meetings to discuss possible direct causes for water pollution and brainstorm ideas for measuring those causes. According to data already collected by the CCWP, fecal waste from pets — specifically pet dogs — accounts for approximately 80 percent of the bacteria in the creek. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Houston-Galveston Area Council are facilitating the partnership’s strategy development process with help from a grant provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Justin Bower, senior planner with H-GAC, led the meetings, which he said are meant to gather recommendations and information for the partnership before the steering committee approves recommendations for the next phase of reducing waste in the watershed. Human waste During the Nov. 14 work group meeting at Barbara Bush Library, Bower met with interested community members and local stakeholders to discuss human-related sources, including pet waste. The partnership website states that certain sections of the watershed’s waterways have levels of fecal contaminants exceeding Texas’ limit for recreational use. The fecal contamination comes from a variety of sources, including human wastewater and animals, according to the website. Bower said human waste is more likely to get humans sick than animal waste or other sources. Related: Fecal matter in Cypress Creek prompts watershed protection plan Attendees suggested better educating other community members about the dangers of exposure to stormwater due to pollution, more frequent unannounced testing of wastewater treatment plants, and reinforcing the importance of picking up waste from pets. Part of the issue is knowing generally what kind of waste is coming in-stream, but not being able to pinpoint where exactly the sources of pollution are the worst. For instance, data collected at wastewater treatment plants is being accounted for in the WPP, but the exact levels of pollution along the waterway are not specified. “We recommend looking for resources to do additional in-stream targeted sampling,” Bower said. “Let’s say we have an issue with one tributary. Do some targeted sampling up and down there so we can start to say, ‘It’s good here, it’s good here, what’s in between those.’” Bower said when contaminant sources are found, then the CCWP can work with Harris County and the TCEQ to address those sources contributing to water quality issues. Bower said the CCWP is speaking with apartment complexes and neighborhoods to get a better sense of how many people pick up their pet waste and if they have the resources available to do so, such as pet waste disposal stations. The information gathered may result in a lower documented percentage of waste from pets than was previously thought. “We just assumed when we populated dog numbers that those dogs are producing waste that is making it to the stream, which isn’t necessarily the case,” he said. “We’ll find a conservative estimate to reduce that number by to reflect ownership.” Livestock and wildlife waste While livestock waste, including cows, horses, goats, sheep and pigs, may not be the largest contributor to the pollution of Cypress Creek, Bower said it is still an issue for the partnership to address during the work group meeting about agriculture, wildlife and invasive species’ impact on water quality Nov. 18 at the Weekley Community Center. Currently the CCWP is looking for more direct measurement of livestock populations near the waterways to determine the actual impact and significance of their waste. Bower said the CCWP is already aware they need to reduce their previously measured impact of animal waste on Cypress Creek downstream. “When we looked at the numbers initially, we had about 10 percent of the total amount of watershed coming from cattle or livestock,” he said. “Unsurprisingly most of them are out on the prairie or west of (SH)99. We looked at the cattle numbers versus the stocking rates that some of the district board members suggested ... and our numbers were actually pretty close.” Mary Anne Piacentini, executive director of the Katy Prairie Conservancy, said the conservancy is working to keep cattle from polluting the waterways. “On Warren Ranch all of our streams now are fenced off so the cattle are not getting into our streams,” she said. “So, you’ve got 600 cattle that aren’t getting to the stream that way. The hope is that we’re going to be able to do more of that on our other properties if we get to convert all of our herds.” Just like with other sources, the closer the source is to the stream, within a buffer that the CCWP has determined, the more impact their waste will have on the waterway. Bower said waste from agriculture is not necessarily the main issue, but it still needs to be stopped and people need to be warned to avoid contact with the water if possible. As for species like feral hogs and deer, sparse data is present for either group right now. Feral hogs can be a problem for the watershed due to their high reproductive rates, tendency to destroy vegetation and destabilize streams, along with their waste, Bower said. Bower said feral hog concentrations are higher in the western portion of Harris County with less development. “The largest percent (of waste feral hogs produce) in any of the watershed is about 4 percent before we move the numbers so they’re going to be probably about 6 or 7 (percent) in the western most part,” he said. Deer waste contribution data is also sparse but needs measurement. Bower said data is needed for all other wildlife, but probably won’t be a major consideration unless they have a large impact in larger numbers. For instance, birds are not perceived as having as large of an impact as other sources. What now? The CCWP will host a public meeting Nov. 21 to provide information on past meetings and receive more feedback and suggestions for the WPP. Information about the partnership and future efforts can be found at https://cypresspartnership.weebly.com/. Bower suggested citizens do all they can to prevent waste from polluting waterways by attending CCWP meetings and doing their part within their daily life. “We’re not talking about the old days of the smoke stack coming out of the factory, we’re talking about the cumulative impact of everything everyone’s doing,” he said. “Walk your dog? Pick it up. It’s better than drinking it.” chevall.pryce@chron.com

 By Sergio Chapa A petrochemical plant located about 120 miles southwest of Houston has entered into $50 million settlement in a lawsuit over polluting Lavaca Bay with plastic pellets. Formosa Plastics Corp., San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and Calhoun County resident Diane Wilson reached the settlement on Tuesday, according to a U.S. District Court filing in Victoria. Company officials reported that the $50 million would go to the newly formed Matagorda Bay Mitigation Trust to promote environmental sustainability in the region. Some of those projects include working with the Matagorda Bay Fishing Cooperative to restore marine ecosystems, environmental restoration work Green Lake Park in Calhoun County, YMCA youth camps, beach restoration and funding the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve's "Nurdle Patrol" to find and remove plastic pellets known as nurdles along area waterways. “The conditions agreed to in this settlement demonstrate Formosa’s commitment to manufacturing our products in a safe and environmentally friendly manner,” Formosa Plastics Corp. USA Executive Vice President Ken Mounger said in a statement. “We will continue to partner with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that FPC USA environmental programs are at the top of our industry.” Downstream: Judge finds Formosa liable for plastic pollution at Texas plant In a statement, Wilson called the settlement a victory for the environment. “The years of fighting to protect the natural resources of the Lavaca Bay-Cox Creek area have finally paid off,” Wilson said. “It’s a huge victory for the environment – and for the people who love and depend upon it. We look forward to working with Formosa to restore the health of our environment and make sure it stays pristine.” Texas RioGrande Legal Aid sued Formosa in July 2017 on behalf Wilson and her group, the San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper. The suit alleged Formosa had polluted waterways near its Point Comfort plant for nearly three decades. Wilson, a Calhoun County native and former shrimper, had fought Formosa since the early 1990s. Employing more than 1,900 employees and 795 contractors, the Point Comfort plant produces resins for plastics such as high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). “A settlement of this size sends a powerful message to corporate polluters – there’s a steep price to pay for flagrant, chronic violations of laws that protect our environment,” Texas RioGrande Legal Aid attorney Erin Gaines said in a statement. “And with plastics pollution of our oceans at a crisis, the message comes at a vital time.” Fuel Fix: Get daily energy news headlines in your inbox Founded in 1954 and headquartered in Taiwan, Formosa was ranked as one of the world's largest chemical companies. Formosa's U.S. headquarters is in New Jersey. Company officials previously said that they have installed multiple screening and control systems to control pollution. The company has said it has the plant has 16 full-time contract employees whose main job is to clean up debris and pellets outside the plant.

 Dan Freedman Caption Close Washington Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Wednesday will introduce legislation to force the Environmental Protection Agency to set maximum levels for the class of chemicals involved in drinking-water contamination in Hoosick Falls and other sites in New York. The measure would require the EPA to set maximum levels for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS for short. The EPA would have two years to do it. In February, the EPA issued what its top official termed an "all-encompassing plan" on PFAS but sidestepped setting maximum levels. The agency, which under President Donald Trump has been in the forefront of rolling back pollution regulations, promised to look into setting new levels. Currently there is no maximum established for PFAS, but the EPA has established a health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) in drinking water. Gillibrand's bill, co-authored with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., reflects the skepticism of health and environmental advocates who say they doubt the EPA will buck the chemical industry's lobbyists. "It is the EPA's job to protect Americans from highly toxic chemicals like PFAS, but they have failed to do what is necessary to help ensure our families in New York and across the country are no longer exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS in their drinking water," Gillibrand said in a statement. "This is a widespread crisis that is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk." Gillibrand has been alternating periods of legislative activity on Capitol Hill with appearances on the campaign trail in her bid to become the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. Toxic levels of a variety of PFAS were found in the drinking water in Hoosick Falls in 2014, the result of filtration from a nearby plant producing chemicals for nonstick plastics in cookware and other products. The levels discovered in Hoosick Falls in 2014 ranged from 180 ppt to 540 ppt. Health and environmental experts and advocates say the advisory level of 70 ppt is too high. In December, the New York Drinking Water Quality Council recommended a "maximum contaminant level" of 10 parts per billion for the two PFAS chemicals found in water in Hoosick Falls, Petersburgh, Newburgh and elsewhere in the state. They are PFOA — perfluorooctanoic acid — and PFOS — perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. But the recommendation has not officially been adopted by the state Department of Health. If it were in force, it would be the most stringent state standard in the nation. The chemical industry has gradually withdrawn PFAS from the market, putting in place substitutes like GenX. But advocates have pointed to studies casting doubt on industry claims that GenX and other chemicals like it are much of an improvement. The industry generally has been supportive of efforts to fight contamination, including specific ceilings for PFAS. But they warn against what they see as overkill. "The weight of scientific evidence does not support some of the proposed policies that are currently under consideration," said John Banovetz, a senior vice president at 3M Corp. "In fact, no public health agency in the world has found that PFAS cause harm to human health at past or current exposure levels." He added: "Legislatively dictated, predetermined outcomes that don't follow the science would undermine the integrity of the regulatory process going forward." The discovery of toxins in drinking water turned Hoosick Falls into a ground zero of sorts for chemical pollution in water. PFAS do not dissipate once they infiltrate ground water. Studies have linked the chemicals to kidney, breast and testicular cancer. The EPA designated parts of the village as Superfund cleanup sites, and its drinking water is now filtered by equipment supplied by the plastics manufacturer blamed for causing the pollution, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, a multinational corporation based in France. The village of Hoosick Falls has been involved in legal action against Saint-Gobain and Honeywell International, another operator of a factory in the area. Gillibrand and Capito are both members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which will hold a legislative hearing on chemical pollution next Wednesday. In addition, the House Energy & Commerce subcommittee on environment and climate change, chaired by Rep. Paul Tonko, D-Amsterdam, will hold a hearing Wednesday on 13 House bills also aimed at reining in PFAS pollution. Among them is one authored by freshman Rep. Antonio Delgado, D-Rhinebeck, which would require EPA public reporting of PFAS releases. Among the witnesses testifying will be Emily Marpe, a mother and community member from Petersburgh.

 By Brian Nearing Watervliet A military contractor at the Watervliet Arsenal is paying a $50,000 fine for failing to properly maintain air pollution control equipment, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Hartchrom Inc., a chrome plating company that lines cannon tubes for the U.S. Army, also agreed to improve its inspection and record-keeping for equipment used to control pollution from its chroming process. During two visits to the Building 35 facility in early August 2018, state inspectors found that Hartchrom workers were failing to inspect the pollution control equipment for cracks or leaks. The inspectors then discovered cracks in equipment meant to remove chromium, a toxic, carcinogenic heavy metal. If Hartchrom fixes the issues, DEC agreed to suspend an additional $10,000 fine, according to an agreement signed by DEC and Hartchrom last month. Calls to Hartchrom for comment Tuesday weren't returned. Calls to Michael Sterthous, an Albany-based lawyer for Hartchrom, which has been at the arsenal since 2002, for comment also weren't returned. In March 2017, the Swiss-based company was awarded a $17 million contract from the U.S. Army to perform chrome-plating and surfacing operations for cannon barrels on 120 millimeter and 155 millimeter cannon. According to a DEC statement, the agency has "no evidence of Hartchrom violating emission standards." When pollution equipment was tested by state inspectors in October 2015, it was found to be operating within acceptable limits, according to DEC. When the cracks were found in August 2018, the equipment was again found to be working properly. DEC indicated that Hartchrom was last cited by DEC in 2010 for violations that included beginning construction without a permit. In 2014, the company got into a dispute with arsenal managers over the company's attempted improper disposal of tainted production liquid at the facility's wastewater treatment plant. Arsenal officials stopped the company from dumping 39,000 gallons of tainted liquid, forcing Hartchrom to dispose of the liquid as hazardous waste. Afterward, Hartchrom tried to recoup what it claimed were more than $92,000 in disposal and lost revenue expenses from the U.S. Army. But last year, the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals denied the claim. Calls to arsenal officials for comment weren't returned. Last year, the Army took back management control of the arsenal from the not-for-profit Arsenal Business & Technology Partnership, which had brought in Hartchrom as a tenant.

 By Brian Nearing Schenectady Toxic chemicals will be dug out of two vacant former dry cleaners sites in Schenectady and Watervliet, under plans announced by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The property around the former Admiral Cleaners, 617 19th St., Watervliet, and the former Kenwood Cleaners, 445 Duane Ave., Schenectady, are tainted with high levels of a carcinogenic dry cleaning solvent, tetrachloroethene (PCE), and related toxic byproducts. Exposure to PCE likely increases cancer risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Primary effects from chronic, long-term inhalation exposure are neurological, including impaired cognitive and motor neurobehavioral performance, according to EPA. PCE exposure may also "cause adverse effects in the kidney, liver, immune system and hematologic system, and on development and reproduction," according to the EPA. DEC plans to dig up and dispose of about 15 feet of PCE-tainted soil around the Admiral site and remove an underground storage tank, according to agency paperwork. The site closed in 2017, but had been a dry cleaners since 1950 before closing in 2013 due to environmental violations. After that, it was used as a drop-off shop for dry cleaning, where clothes were taken elsewhere to be cleaned. The $400,000 cost of the program would be paid for the by the state Superfund program, which covers the expense of cleanups when the person or company responsible for the pollution cannot pay or refuses to do so. A copy of the plan can be found in the office of the Watervliet city clerk at 2 Fifteenth St., Watervliet. At the former Kenwood site, about 20 feet of PCE-tainted soil will be removed and disposed of as part of a $1.1 million cleanup plan, according to DEC paperwork. It also will be paid for through the state Superfund program. The cleaners opened in 1950, and operated as late as the 1980s, according to DEC. PCE was found in both the ground and groundwater at levels well beyond state safety standards. PCE vapors were also found to be leaking out of the ground, including at one unspecified "off-site" location. A copy of the plan can be found at the Phyllis Bornt Branch Library, 948 State St., Schenectady.

(Pioneer file photo) Caption Close Within a few weeks, more anglers hope to be on their boats. (Pioneer file photo) Within a few weeks, more anglers hope to be on their boats. (Pioneer file photo) BIG RAPIDS — With the current, global COVID-19 situation, DNR advises fishermen to head out to fish only if you're feeling well and practice social distancing, at least 6 feet away from another person. Frequently wash your hands with soap and warm water, or use hand sanitizer. If driving to or from your fishing spot, roll the windows down a bit for air flow, the DNR said. Though anglers are still ice fishing in the northern regions of the state, the shoreline ice is breaking up and making it harder for anglers to get on and off the ice. Where the waters have opened up, docks are slowly being installed. In Mecosta County, “there’s a few guys still out fishing for perch at Davis Bridge,” Tanner Havens of Frank’s Sporting Goods in Morley said. “It’s slowed down the last couple of weeks. We’re just waiting for some rain down to Croton, they’re catching a lot of steelhead. That’s starting to heat up. With a little bit of rain in the next week or two, it’s getting ready to kick off. We’re needing some rain.” Tom Tanner, of Triggertime Outfitters, Big Rapids, said it’s still a transitional period from ice to regular fishing. “There’s some steelhead and trout fishing. But I have no clue how it’s going,” Tanner said. In northwest Michigan, at Lakes Cadillac and Mitchell, anglers still were ice fishing, although the ice is becoming more and more questionable, the DNR said. Areas with moving water have opened, and the shoreline is starting to open. “Steelhead is the order of the day, Rob Eckerson of Pappy’s Bait Shop in Wellston said. “The Big Manistee is the place to be. Water is around 39 degrees. At 40 is when it starts to picking up. River flow is medium, so that’s also good. Bear Creek has fish in it Betsie River has fish in it. The lakes have opened up. You can launch a boat at Portage Lake and you can launch a boat at Manistee Lake.” At Manistee, pier anglers were getting some steelhead. Once the waters clear up, fishing should be decent for steelhead and brown trout, the DNR said. “I haven’t heard of any walleye yet being caught off the pier,” Bud Fitzgerald, of Tangle Tackle Co. said. “River fishing seem to be pretty good all the way from the dam down. For the Manistee River steelhead are in the river; however, there have been no great reports coming in, the DNR said “It’s slow down a little bit,” Kristen Loeffler said. “It’s mainly because of the coronaviris. The people going out fishing they’re going to Manistee Lake and doing perch fishing. I here they’re doing pretty good. I heard some people are going to the river. I don’t know how they’re dig there. I had some guys heading down to Manistee Lake. Some guys are heading over to Portage.” Pier fishing should improve for steelhead and brown trout at Ludington, the DNR said. Fishing Tip: Storing ice-fishing equipment for next season Courtesy of the Michigan DNR You may want to think about getting ready to store your ice fishing equipment. The key is doing it properly, so you’ll be ready to hit the ice next winter. Here is a checklist of things to do: •If you have an auger, check for any damage and dry all the blades before storing it. You may want to consult your power auger’s manual to know how to appropriately handle any leftover gas and how to protect the engine. •Remove batteries from any electronics to prevent any potential damage from leaking batteries. •Make sure your portable shelter is completely clean and dry before storing. You may want to put some moth balls in it or hang it to keep pests at bay. •Take a full inventory of your rods, reels and tackle to see what you might need/want next year. Also remove all bait or line from your hooks and lures for storage and make sure everything is dry. By the time everything is properly stored, you’ll be itching to get out on your favorite stream, river or lake for some spring fishing.

 MNA Staff Caption Close From the Lansing State Journal LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Scientists want to use an unconventional method to remove pollution at former General Motors properties near Lansing where an underground plume of chemicals is creeping toward drinking water wells. The Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust controls the former GM plants. It is proposing a remediation method called "biosparging," which removes pollution by injecting air into groundwater. The method encourages bacteria to consume 1,4-dioxane, an industrial chemical that GM used to clean oil off car parts. Should the trust gain state approval, the project would be among the first and likely the largest to use the method, the Lansing State Journal reported . It's unclear how much the project would cost, but engineers said it could take six to 12 years to fully clean the water. The pollution was discovered after the trust was established by the federal government to take over the GM sites following the company's bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. The dioxane plume is located under two former GM plants in Lansing Township and Lansing. Dave Favero, deputy cleanup manager for the Michigan properties, said dioxane is very soluble. If dioxane is in oil, as it was used at the GM plants, "it leaches out and starts to migrate with the groundwater," he said. Long-term exposure could lead to liver, kidney and reproductive problems and possibly cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Lansing-area plume is within the Lansing Board of Water and Light's wellhead protection area for some of its drinking water wells. Up to 10 of the utility's wells are downstream from the polluted groundwater. The utility started monitoring for dioxane in 2015, and found a small amount within the limits of what the EPA considers safe. The utility hasn't monitored dioxane levels that exceed the EPA's safe limit yet. The trust will need to get approval from state environmental regulators. Scientists and engineers could begin installing biosparging wells this year if the plan is approved.

 By Brian Nearing Troy Petroleum giant Chevron could pay about $1.8 million to clean up a former industrial site in South Troy once used to make manufactured coal gas and later to store asphalt, according to a plan being considered by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Work at the 7-acre Water Street property, located just south of the Route 378 (Menands) bridge, should start next year and last about nine months, according to a DEC notice this week. Storage tanks on the site were removed in 2006 and the site is currently vacant. California-based Chevron USA Inc. would pay to remove about 725 cubic yards of soil contaminated with nearly a dozen industrial chemicals, tar and asphalt left behind when the site closed in 1999 after at least seven decades of industrial use, first for plants that manufactured coal coke and gas, and then for asphalt storage and distribution. The ground is now polluted with aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzopyrene, benzoanthracene, benzene, toluene, arsenic and xylene. Tests have found coal tar as far as 11 feet underground. Once the contaminated soil is removed, the cleanup plan calls for the site to be covered with soil "acceptable for commercial and industrial land use," according to DEC. The land has been filled in with "slag, cinders, brick, gravel and other materials" over the past, according to DEC. DEC will hold a public hearing on the proposal at 7 p.m. Feb. 20 at Troy City Hall, 433 River St., and is taking public comments on the plan Feb. 1 through March 2, through John Spellman, project manager, NYSDEC, Division of Environmental Remediation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233, or john.spellman@dec.ny.gov. A copy of the proposal is available for public inspection at the Troy Public Library, 100 Second St., Troy.

 By Marissa Luck Exxon Mobil, under pressure from shareholders, has agreed to report plastic pellet spills from its polymer production plants to prevent ocean pollution, according to a shareholder group that focuses on corporate responsibility. The shareholder group, As You Sow, filed a proposed shareholder resolution in January with several major petrochemical producers, including Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical, Phillips 66 and Chevron, asking for annual reporting on spills and measures taken to prevent and clean up spills. Exxon appears to be the first company to succumb to the pressure. Under a deal struck with As You Sow, Exxon will begin providing details about whether any spills occurred, specifics about how it is monitoring for spills and how it is managing pellets. It will also describe how the company assesses the effectiveness of pellet loss prevention measures. The company apparently did not have any spills though in 2018, according to As You Sow. As a result of the agreement, As You Sow withdrew its shareholder proposal, according to SEC documents. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond what was said in the SEC documents acknowledging the withdrawal of the shareholder proposal. RELATED: Reporter’s Notebook: Can chemistry fix the plastic waste problem? "We are pleased that Exxon Mobil has agreed to do public reporting on plastic pellet spills and management," said Conrad MacKerron, senior vice president at As You Sow in a statement. "It is important for all industry players to establish similar transparency so stakeholders can get a realistic view of the size and scope of this problem. We hope the other companies we are engaged with will follow its lead. 260 species affected Exxon's petrochemical division has several plants that produce plastic pellets, called nurdles, which are used to produce thousands of everyday plastic products. These tiny plastic pellets, which can be spilled during handling and transportation and swept into waterways, are estimated to be the second largest direct source of microplastic pollution to the ocean by weight. The tiny pellets, the size of fish eggs, make their way onto shorelines, beaches and break up into smaller pieces that animals can mistake as food. Plastic pollution affects 260 species, causing fatalities from ingestion, entanglement, suffocation and drowning, according to As You Sow. Exxon Mobil is the first major petrochemical producer to agree to report information on plastic pellet spills publicly to shareholders, said Jane Patton, coordinator based in New Orleans with the anti-plastic pollution advocacy movement Break Free From Plastic. "This is significant and huge," Patton said. "I'm glad they're willing to disclose this, but there is a lot more that Exxon needs to be doing to mitigate harm to local communities" that comes as a result of air and waste pollution from petrochemical plants." Many petrochemical companies are involved in a program called Operation Clean Sweep that aims to promote best practices for pellet management and containment to prevent pellet spills.But As You Sow has criticized the group because it doesn't require companies to publicly report spills or plastic management methods. TEAMING UP: LyondellBasell, Dow chiefs call on industry to fix plastic waste problem The other shareholder proposals filed with Chevron, Phillips 66 and Dow Chemical will likely be voted on during shareholder meetings this spring. Taking responsibility As You Sow last year was involved in successful efforts to push Starbucks to ditch plastic straws and pressure KraftHeinz, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and others to commit to increase the use of recycled packaging in their products. Chuck Venezia, senior vice president of petrochemicals at the analyst and research firm Argus Media, said petrochemical companies typically have redundant systems to prevent spills because it's in their best economic interest to avoid losing the product. The issue of plastic pellet spills has not been a major focus area yet for the industry, but he noted that the industry is starting to take more responsibility for reducing plastic waste through better waste management systems, community education and recycling initiatives. "There are so many benefits to plastics that are not getting reported – but just like everything else they need to be handled and treated properly," Venezia said. Ashish Chitalia, polyolefin analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the industry is responding broader backlash against single-use plastics with initiatives such as the nonprofit the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. "We expect to see broader participation in reporting the plastic pellet losses, as doing so may enable companies to improve their economics, standard handling procedure and their sustainability goals," Chitalia said.

 By Taylor Goldenstein AUSTIN — Attorney General Ken Paxton, on behalf of the state’s top regulatory agency, filed suit Friday against the company responsible for the Deer Park fire, alleging it released pollution in violation of the Texas Clean Air Act. In the 18-page suit filed in a Travis County district court, Paxton seeks a citation and civil penalties against Intercontinental Terminals Company, the liquid storage terminal company whose facility caused a series of fires this week, for violations of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality rules. The violations include unauthorized air pollution, outdoor burning and visible emissions. Paxton also seeks an injunction to force the company to comply with the law. “The state of Texas works hard to maintain good air quality and will hold ITC accountable for the damage it has done to our environment,” Paxton said in a statement. “ITC has a history of environmental violations, and this latest incident is especially disturbing and frightening. No company can be allowed to disrupt lives and put public health and safety at risk.” For subscribers: Latest fire contained at charred Deer Park plant The TCEQ continues to monitor the air quality in the affected areas about 20 miles east of Houston. The federal Chemical Safety Board, which investigates serious chemical accidents, announced Thursday that it is opening an investigation into the ITC fire. “I would like to thank the Attorney General for acting so quickly on TCEQ’s request to enforce against ICT, LLC,” the environmental agency’s Executive Director Toby Baker said in a statement. So far, Baker said, only air quality violations have been cited in the suit “due to the dynamic, ongoing investigation.” Additional violations, including water quality, will be referred to the Attorney General as part of the action, he said.

 By Erin Douglas Caption Close Companies found to have emitted the most air pollutants in 2017 in Texas, according to an environmental report, are in some cases pinning the blame on Hurricane Harvey, as well as unique one-time plant upsets and maintenance. A recent report based on data filed by companies to state regulators identified Texas' top air polluting companies. Environment Texas, an environmental policy nonprofit that analyzed the data and produces the yearly report, found that the Houston metro area, home to several refineries and petrochemical plants, had the second most unauthorized releases of pollutants in the state. RELATED: Texas for most unauthorized pollution, environmental study finds Companies can receive permits to regularly emit pollution while operating major industrial sites. When facilities exceed those permitted levels, companies are required to report the incidents to state regulators with information that includes how much they emitted and the duration of the incident. Using those filings of unauthorized emissions, Environment Texas found in its yearly analysis, that hundreds of companies reported over 4,000 unauthorized pollution incidents in 2017, up a little over 9 percent from the previous year. The group has conducted the annual assessment since 2015. Companies file emissions event reports each time a plant has an unauthorized release of pollutants due to a malfunction or planned activity, such as equipment maintenance. If the plant claims and proves that the excess emissions were not preventable, among other criteria, then no fine is imposed. Both Exxon Mobil and Magellan Midstream Partners mentioned the hurricane as a key contributor to the high emissions their plants produced in 2017. But Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said he does not believe this is a valid excuse for the pollutants. He pointed to several Corpus Christi plants, which shut down operations several days prior to the hurricane making landfall. "Certainly there were increases in emissions for some facilities during the hurricane, but we think many, if not most were preventable," Metzger said. "These (events) are preventable if companies take the time, spend the money and train their workers to control emissions." The hurricane may have contributed to 8.3 million pounds of air pollution released by industrial plants immediately before, during and after the storm, as a result of waiting too long to shut down, according to a separate report by the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit organization. Other companies said that the high levels of emissions during 2017 were due to scheduled, one-time work and other singular events. Metzger, however, said contrary to these being one-time events, data from prior years show that violations are ongoing and occur over and over again. PLASTICS: For LyondellBasell CEO, pollution is personal In 2017, 275 companies reported over 4,000 emissions events that resulted in the release of more than 63 million pounds of air pollution in the state, up 27 percent from 2016. As a comparison, the average American family emits 411 pounds of sulfur dioxide each year, according to the Leonardo Academy, a nonprofit that quantifies environmental impacts. The Environment Texas report questioned how effective the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's regulatory process is, showing that enforcement has decreased as a percent of emissions events since 2011. There were more than 4,000 reported unauthorized emissions events reported in the state in 2017, yet the TCEQ only imposed penalties on 58 emissions events that year, data showed. The TCEQ declined to comment on the report specifically, but Brian McGovern, TCEQ spokesperson, said the commission "vigorously" defends its enforcement process. Here are facilities with the greatest unauthorized emissions, according to the Environment Texas analysis: 1. Waha Header Compressor Station, Trans-Pecos Pipeline LLC 3.88 million total pounds "This was the result of an isolated event due to scheduled work that occurred on the pipeline back in 2017," wrote Lisa Dillinger, spokesperson for Energy Transfer, in a statement. "This is not something that will be re-occurring." 2. Mabee Ranch CO2 Plant, Chevron USA Inc. 3.26 million total pounds "In February 2017, we experienced an event at the Mabee C02 Plant, which accounted for over 80 percent of the facility's emissions referenced in the report," wrote Veronica Flores-Paniagua, spokesperson for Chevron, in a statement. "In 2018, we made significant investments in the McElroy field and Mabee C02 Plant to decrease emissions and improve reliability." 3. Seminole Gas Processing Plant, Hess Corporation, OXY USA Inc. 3.03 million total pounds "Occidental took over operatorship of the Seminole Plant in September 2017, and is actively investing in programs to control, monitor and minimize emissions from that plant as we do for all of our operated assets," wrote Susie Geiger, spokesperson for Occidental, in a statement. 4. Galena Park Terminal, Magellan Terminal Holding LP 2.53 million total pounds "Like many others in the energy industry with facilities along the Texas Gulf Coast, in 2017 our Galena Park facility experienced record breaking rainfall and flooding from Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in a petroleum products release and associated emissions event," wrote Bruce Heine, spokesperson for Magellan Midstream Partners in a statement. 5. Silvertio 76 17 Unit P 1H, Anadarko E&P Onshore LLC 2.16 million total pounds "The emissions cited in the report are related to a well-control event that occurred in 2017," wrote John Christiansen, spokesperson for Anadarko Petroleum. "We reported both the event and associated emissions to the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, respectively, with the Railroad Commission overseeing the cleanup that was completed in 2017." 6. ExxonMobil Beaumont Refinery, ExxonMobil Oil Corp. 1.74 million total pounds "The Environment Texas report compiles emissions data submitted to TCEQ for isolated events," wrote Sarah Nordin, spokesperson for ExxonMobil Oil Corp. "Compiling this data does not tell the whole story, especially in 2017 with the impacts of Hurricane Harvey." 7. James Lake Gas Plant, James Lake Midstream LLC 1.57 million total pounds James Lake Midstream could not be reached for comment. 8. JT McElroy 202 TB, Chevron USA Inc. 1.53 million total pounds "In 2018, we made significant investments in the McElroy field and Mabee C02 Plant to decrease emissions and improve reliability," wrote Veronica Flores-Paniagua, spokesperson for Chevron, in a statement. 9. Parks Compressor Station, Targa Pipeline Mid Continent WestTex LLC 1.38 million total pounds Targa Pipeline could not be reached for comment. 10.

 Sudhin Thanawala, Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Wildfires in California in 2018 released the rough equivalent of about 68 million tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide — about the same amount of carbon emissions as are produced in a year to provide electricity to the state, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Friday. The carbon dioxide figure — based on data analyzed by the U.S. Geological Survey — is more than 15 percent of all emissions produced by California in a year, according to Zinke. "We know that wildfires can be deadly and cost billions of dollars, but this analysis from the U.S. Geological Survey also shows just how bad catastrophic fires are for the environment and for the public's health," Zinke said in a statement. This year included California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire — a blaze in November that took out nearly 14,000 homes in a rural Northern California county and killed at least 88 people. Another fire that started the same day in Southern California killed three people and destroyed 1,500 structures, including the homes of celebrities in tony Malibu. Those two fires produced emissions equivalent to roughly 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide, Zinke said. The 2018 emissions figure for California wildfires is "strikingly high, significant in the context of overall statewide emissions, and likely a record value for single-year direct carbon emissions from wildfires in California history," said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "It is an alarming number, but we live in a fire-prone state," said Dick Cameron, director of science for land programs at the California chapter of the Nature Conservancy. Zinke used the carbon figure he released Friday to continue to push for the thinning of forests. Cameron said that would help but that climate and home construction were also significant factors in the destructiveness of the fires. Cameron cautioned that wildfire emissions were still a relatively small component of climate changing greenhouse gases. In California, cars and other transportation account for more than 40 percent of total emissions.

 By Brian Nearing Green Island A pollution cleanup for a planned $60 million project at the site of a former oil tank farm on a Hudson River island will continue until early 2020, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The 11.2-acre vacant property, just south of the Green Island Bridge on what is called Center Island, was once home to King Fuels, which closed in 2008 after nearly a century of use as an oil terminal. Peter Luizzi & Bros. Contracting of Albany wants to build a marina there as part of a mixed-used residential and commercial development called Starbuck Island. So far, the developer has pumped out underground oil from the site and removed some tainted soils, said Sean Ward, executive assistant to Green Island Mayor Ellen M. McNulty-Ryan. "The hole dug there must be about 30 feet deep," he said. Now, the site must be refilled and covered over with about two feet of clean soil to meet state pollution standards for "restricted residential use," according to a notice issued Wednesday by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The DEC notice said this work will begin this month and continue for about 15 months. Luizzi wants to construct 250 housing units, along with a marina, offices, restaurants and shops. The plan also calls for 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of commercial and retail space, 5,000 to 10,000 square feet of office space, 8,000 to 10,000 square feet of restaurants, and other amenities. Pollution tests of the site done in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2016 found levels of barium, lead, mercury and other chemicals in the ground and water. This year, DEC has overseen the removal of tons of tainted soil contaminated by fuel oil and other chemicals. Investigations in 2017 found a 3-foot-thick layer of liquid petroleum about 25 feet underground. State-ordered tests also found that the site was made up of as much as 28 feet of "historic fill materials including ash, brick, glass and other waste materials." Cleanup plans included: — Removal of underground storage tanks.— Collection and testing of groundwater.— Injection of chemical stabilizers to neutralize contaminated groundwater.— Filling in and covering over remediated areas with clean soil.— Installation of a "cover system" consisting of building foundations, retaining walls, rip-rap, asphalt roads and walkways.— Areas not paved over will be covered with 2 feet of clean soil in order to meet state safety standards for residential areas.— Installation of vapor intrusion mitigation systems in all on-site buildings.— Creation of a health and safety plan, and a community air monitoring plan as the cleanup continues.

 By Kenneth C. Crowe II Caption Close NASSAU – The town crowned Tributary T-11A as Little Thunder Brook to transform it from a quiet little stream that’s been polluted by the Dewey Loeffel Landfill Superfund Site to a war cry recalling the community’s 19th century history of fighting back. “Referring to the stream at T-11A doesn’t do it justice. We’re trying to stand up for rural New Yorkers who’ve been ignored,” said Supervisor David Fleming. The Town Board reached back 175 years to capture the fury of the Anti-Rent Wars that shook upstate New York in the 1840s. Frank Abbott fought under the name Little Thunder when he led his neighbors dressed as Indians to protest high rents. They even tarred and feathered their opponents as they fought for their cause. “Frank Abbott helped to bring down politicians that ignored the rights of rural residents. In this fight for our collective future, it is fitting that we honor Abbott’s legacy with the healing represented by the work about to start on Little Thunder Brook,” Fleming said. The town sees itself standing up to Albany and Washington, D.C. using Little Thunder to shout out for attention to neglected issues. The heavily polluted Dewey Loeffel Landfill became a toxic dump when an estimated 46,000 tons of industrial waste were buried at the site. The toxic materials included industrial solvents, waste oil, PCBs, scrap materials, sludge and solids. Soil and sediment along Little Thunder Creek is contaminated with PCBs -- polychlorinated biphenyls --a suspected carcinogen. Little Thunder Creek is a 1,900-foot-long tributary of the Valatie Kill, a protected trout stream that empties into Kinderhook Lake in Columbia County. Until the Town Board acted earlier this month, the creek was unnamed, known only by its forgettable bureaucratic designation of T-11A. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2 Office said in a statement it fully supports the renaming. "EPA encourages community members and their representatives to become involved in the issues that affect their communities. We welcome new ideas to target air, water, and other pollution. Community engagement and grassroots involvement is crucial to addressing environmental concerns such as the contamination in and around the Dewey Loeffel Superfund site," its statement said. The symbolism evoked by the name Little Thunder can be a rallying point for residents and a platform to launch additional action, said Jennifer Dodge, an assistant professor at the state University at Albany’s Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy. “What we can understand from this type of symbolic politics is what is at stake for people in an issue, in addition to the tactical and strategic issues… In the Nassau story, the strategy of naming the river Little Thunder might work well to get people mobilized because they might identify with the “little guy takes on the government” narrative..,” said Dodge, an expert on framing facts, symbolic politics and environmental policy conflicts. The question remains if the new name will be as successful “in the sense of raising the issues up, that is, about the contamination of the water and potentially the human health effects, which is a very powerful narrative in politics,” Dodge said. Dan Shapley, Water Quality Program director for Riverkeeper, said the health of the smallest tributaries impact the Hudson River. "Naming a stream is a simple and powerful act. Once we've ennobled a stream with a name, it's harder to neglect and pollute it. And I have to add, Little Thunder Brook is an awesome name," Shapley said in a statement. Cleanup work is under way at Little Thunder Creek. The General Electric Co. is removing contaminated soil and sediments along the creek. These will be replaced with clean backfill; the stream channel will be restored; and trees and shrubs will be planted. The EPA has said the work will be completed in early 2019.

 Diane Dupuis is the new development director at FLOW (For Love Of Water), the Traverse City-based organization dedicated to preserving the waters of the Great Lakes basin. She previously spent ten years at Interlochen Center for the Arts in communications and fund-development roles before fundraising for two land conservancies. She joins FLOW at a propitious time; the organization has been in the forefront of two high-profile legal fights. One concerns the drawing of water by Nestle in Mecosta County, and the other is the dispute over Line 5 running under the Straits of Mackinac.Northern Express sits down with Dupuis to talk ground water, high water, water justice, and the critical flow that moves — or drains — the people’s fight: money. What is your background?I’m the daughter of two Detroit Public Schools educators and social justice activists. I grew up in the Detroit area, attended Kalamazoo College, and worked in Detroit’s publishing sector for the first part of my career. In 2001 my husband, musician Steve Carey, and I relocated to the Traverse City area with our two small children, and I began working at Interlochen Center for the Arts, first in communications and then in fundraising. From there I joined the fund development staff at the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy. When my elderly mom needed looking after downstate, I was able to make that transition by working in development in Ann Arbor, at Legacy Land Conservancy and then the Ann Arbor Art Center. My nonprofit experience also includes service on the boards of Michigan Writers and Washtenaw Literacy, and I currently serve as vice chair of Michigan Audubon. I’m a hiker, cross-country skier, and sea kayaker equally mesmerized by campfires, star-gazing, and rock-strewn beaches. So why FLOW? Like many lifelong Michiganians as well as those who embrace Michigan later in life, I feel a fundamental connection to our waters, and along with that a conviction that we all share a responsibility for safeguarding this precious asset. In addition to the beauty and grandeur of our waters, and along with the recreational delights and the wildlife habitat they afford, our water is also crucial to human health. Access to clean drinking water is a universal need, and I can’t think of a more important issue facing us at this time than water justice. In working to keep public water publicly available, FLOW collaborates with many partners throughout the Great Lakes states and Canadian provinces from right here in the Grand Traverse region, a water-lover’s paradise. FLOW is the right place for me to roll up my sleeves and live my values, inspired every day amidst a landscape defined by water. Where does FLOW get its funding? Why does FLOW need a development director?FLOW is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that depends on charitable donations to fund our work. Financial support comes from individuals, corporate sponsors, and foundations throughout the Great Lakes basin. We also benefit from the time and expertise that volunteers devote to our effort, everything from helping to make our office run smoothly to pro bono legal work. Midwesterners are particularly generous in supporting causes they believe in, and our region is fortunate to sustain a bright constellation of very worthy organizations working to enhance lives. At FLOW, one aspect of my job is to help ensure that everyone who cares about water justice in the Great Lakes can, with their generosity, participate in moving FLOW’s work forward. Another aspect is to help supporters appreciate how their generosity makes a positive difference in protecting public water from private interests. The part of each day that I most look forward to is thanking all the committed and insightful people who pitch in with energy, resources, and hope. Two of the biggest issues around water and FLOW are Line 5 and Nestle’s continued drawing water. What is the latest on those? As long as the multinational Enbridge Energy continues to operate Line 5 (a major oil pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac), a massive area of the Great Lakes is at risk of a catastrophic oil spill. Last spring, Michigan’s Attorney General Dana Nessel ruled that previous laws and agreements with Enbridge were unconstitutional, invalid, and unenforceable. In June, Enbridge filed suit in the Court of Claims in Lansing against the State of Michigan and its departments to resuscitate the oil tunnel deal. FLOW is providing crucial legal and science support to the effort to decommission the Line 5 pipeline by forcing compliance with environmental and public trust laws. Earlier this fall, the Michigan Court of Claims issued orders accepting FLOW’s and the City of Mackinac Island’s amicus briefs, which reject opposing arguments by Enbridge. The ruling means that vital issues raised by FLOW’s “friend of the court” brief and the city’s brief will be considered by the Michigan Court of Claims, including the public trust rights of citizens to draw drinking water from and otherwise use the Great Lakes, and the soils and bottomlands beneath them, unimpaired by private interests. Also, the fight to keep public water from being sold for private profit remains a focus for FLOW. Private landowners have a right to reasonable use of water for the benefit of their land. But reasonable use does not mean robbing large volumes of water from the headwaters of our streams, lakes, and wetlands—water taken for free and sold elsewhere for private gain. While Nestle pays $200 a year to extract 210 million gallons of water that belongs to everyone, people in our communities have lost access to clean, affordable drinking water. A multinational water bottler’s excessive profiteering doesn’t sit well when people in Flint reel from the lack of access to water safe from the risk of lead poisoning, or tens of thousands of people in Detroit continue to suffer the indignity and harm to families and health from water shutoffs because they cannot afford the high price of water to meet their basic needs, or communities throughout the state wrestle with groundwater contamination from PFAS and other pollutants. What water issues are we dealing with (or ignoring) in this region?Michigan is “The Great Lakes State” but is a failing steward of the sixth Great Lake, the water lying beneath Michigan’s ground. FLOW is calling for state-level reforms to strengthen protection of Michigan’s groundwater. That includes statewide monitoring and replacement of failing septic systems. Michigan prides itself on being an environmental leader, particularly in curbing water pollution. But in one area of water policy, Michigan is dead last among the 50 states: It is the only state in the nation that lacks a uniform sanitary code requiring periodic inspection and maintenance of septic systems – even though 30 percent of Michiganians rely on such systems. An estimated 130,000 septic systems in the state are failing, releasing 5.2 billion gallons of sewage annually into Michigan waters. Numerous Michigan rivers and lakes have detectable levels of human fecal bacteria. Groundwater, too, is contaminated by septic wastes. This issue needs more attention throughout Michigan. What is the deal with the high water levels? How will this affect us going forward?Scientists don’t know whether Great Lakes levels will rise or fall in response to climate change, as increases in precipitation may be offset by increased evaporation from higher temperatures and reduced ice cover. Climate science makes clear, though, that the frequency and severity of storm events will increase the potential for unprecedented, rapid changes in Great Lakes levels. We only have to look back six years or so to a time when water levels in 2013 were significantly lower than average, compared to the high levels we see today. This dramatic fluctuation in water levels is yet another sign of the climate crisis that is evidenced by extremes of all kinds: storms, droughts, floods, wildfires, polar melting, record-breaking temperatures, and more. Is avian botulism still a thing Up North?Avian botulism kills diving ducks and loons, often as they begin their migratory flight to winter habitat. The numbers are down from a high in 2012 or thereabouts. Of the six or so bird carcasses collected in the Sleeping Bear Dunes area this fall, I’m told that avian botulism was detected in about half.Where else does FLOW work? Are there other Great Lakes efforts we should be aware of in this area?Around the Great Lakes, which contain roughly 20 percent of the world’s available surface fresh water, old and failing infrastructure, urbanization, intense agricultural uses, runoff and many more sources are threatening water quality. For specific localities around the region, “OUR20” is a FLOW initiative that empowers local communities to instill the values of water stewardship in their policies and practices. This grassroots, place-based program is built on the knowledge that water is precious to all, and its stewardship has the potential to unite communities in achieving environmental goals. Any community can adopt the “OUR20” model. How can people can get involved/take action?Becoming and staying informed is fundamental, and FLOW’s twice-monthly e-newsletter is a great place to start. It highlights issues and events, and offers information on specific actions that individuals can undertake to increase their involvement and create change. Sign up is easy, at flowforwater.org/get-involved/sign-up-here/. We also encourage citizens to follow us on Facebook to stay abreast of water news on a daily basis. Follow us here: Facebook.com/FlowforWater. FLOW also welcomes volunteers for a range of activities. And, of course, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t mention our website’s donation page: https://flowforwater.org/donate/ Is water the next precious commodity? What does than mean for the Great Lakes? Nature and ecological systems provide trillions of dollars in annual benefits to humanity. The Great Lakes and their tributary rivers and streams, wetlands, and groundwater – the largest fresh surface water system in the world – are an immense source of natural capital that will become increasingly valuable as the accumulating effects of climate change stress the global environment, and worsening water scarcity draws attention to the water wealth of the Great Lakes region. As populations shift to water-rich regions, infrastructure and water justice will become increasingly critical, as will the imperative to keep public water publicly available. What's needed most right now? Where should the general public be putting forth their time, energy and money? Water is at the nexus of food, energy, transportation, the climate crisis, social justice, and the economy. Solutions based on law and science can prevail with public support.ART, MEET WATER (AND FUNDRAISING SUCCESS)Part art exhibit, part fundraiser, and all about the water, Higher Art Gallery’s “Source: Artists for FLOW” exhibit recently featured 32 pieces — created by 21 different artists — connected to and/or commentaries on the region’s land and water. Thanks to proceeds from the opening night event and works sold, the gallery raised $4,500 for FLOW. The event and exhibit were not only one of two fundraisers gallery owner Shanny Brooke creates each year to give back to the community but also proof of how effectively art and water can work together — a foundation FLOW communications coordinator Jacob Wheeler said feeds FLOW’s new Art Meets Water initiative. “It’s clear that one of the most important ways to connect with water is to connect emotionally,” he said. And art appeals to the emotions. “Literature, music, dance, poetry, and art all come into play. To get people to think more of water and what FLOW does, [art] is a great tool.” The organization’s new Art Meets Water hub features inspirational tools aplenty: a groundwater video that includes a painting by Glenn Wolff and narration by Anne-Marie Oomen; photos of the artists and their work at Higher Art Gallery; Oomen's "Love Letters to the Lakes," presented to the International Joint Commission this summer; and video of Crispin Campbell and Michael Delp's cello-poetry collaboration at FLOW’s “In Praise of Water” benefit last June at the Cathedral Barn in the Commons.

 Located on 200 acres on a pond in the woods between Kalkaska and Mancelona, the Au Sable Institute still looks like the small summer boys camp it once was, since its founding in the 1950s.But it’s much more than a camp today. Throughout the school year, Au Sable hosts hundreds of students from around northern Michigan for field trips exploring the natural world. Each summer, the institute hosts 30 to 40 college students from around the country to teach them how to be Christian environmentalists.Au Sable is the headquarters for an institute that runs environmental studies campuses in Washington State, Costa Rica, India, and, beginning next year, Chicago.Fred Van Dyke, Au Sable’s executive director, is a formally trained wildlife biologist and self-taught theologian, and he’s passionate about expressing his faith through environmental work. That might make Van Dyke unusual among evangelicals, but Van Dyke hopes to change that, one student and a time.Northern Express trekked into the woods to visit Van Dyke at the institute’s campus and learned about how the place started and what they do. Northern Express: So, if I follow correctly, Dr. Harold Snyder established this place first as the Au Sable Trails Camp for Youth in the 1950s, and, over the years it evolved into the institute that it is today. A major turning point that made that possible came in 1979, after Au Sable received an incredible gift. Fred Van Dyke: Yes. One of the gifts, not the only one, was the fact that Harold bought this land originally from a man named Louie Kleinschmidt. And Louie was not particularly well-liked, locally. He was an alcoholic and lived alone in a trailer in the woods. He didn’t have many friends, but Harold consistently befriended him. Harold wanted to win Louie to Jesus Christ, so he often brought Louie over to the camp to meet the boys, get comfortable. Louie did, and it was very moving for him. Harold relates that Louie often cried when he talked to the boys. As far as we know, Harold did not succeed in his primary objective. But one winter when they hadn’t heard or seen Louie around for a while, one of the neighbors went to the trailer and banged on the door. No answer. He went inside. And Louie was dead. But Louie had changed his will, and in his will, he had bequeathed to the institute 80 acres, close to but not contiguous with it, down on Sunset Trail, close to Pickerel Lake. Express: And that turned out to be a very valuable piece of property. Van Dyke: No one thought much of it at the time because it was covered with scrubby pines. But Louis also bequeathed with that land the mineral rights, and as the energy development began in this part of the country in the 1970s, some energy companies approached the board and asked for permission to explore that back 80. The board didn’t initially agree, but they negotiated with a lot of different companies and finally reached an agreement. And the deposit that they struck has been one of the longest-lasting and most productive — both with oil and natural gas — in northern Michigan. That led to a lot of royalties. To be as precise as possible, 1979 is an important year, because that is when Au Sable officially became an Institute. Express: Do you agree that it’s ironic that an institute dedicated to environmental studies owes its life to oil money? Is there anything about that that you find problematic? Van Dyke: Well, some people do, but I think it’s not as ironic as it looks, for several reasons. The first is that I haven’t been an academic all my life. I used to work for Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks as a wildlife biologist, and I know that my helicopter that we used to radio-collar the moose and the elk and the deer, was burning about 15 to 20 gallons of flight fuel per hour. And the Super Cub, the plane I used to track them, was burning about six to 10 gallons an hour. And if we get bigger, it takes 500,000 gallons of rocket fuel to put one satellite in orbit that will track whales and ospreys and all kinds of long-distance moving creatures.Conservation is very energy demanding. If you make it more local, in order to teach the students how to care for God’s creation, to do a good job, we’re going to have to move them off of this campus sometimes, so we will consume gasoline and fossil fuels like that in the course of their education. So, in that sense, whether we had the wells or not, we would be a consumer of fossil fuels until we succeed in transforming our technology, which we intend to do over the long haul, so it doesn’t need carbon emission-type fuels. Express: You’ve given this a lot of thought. Van Dyke: The second dimension of it, which is not as much ironic as it is appropriate, is that we recognize being part of the problem of landscape fragmentation. The Au Sable well, when it was put in, removed forest, and that’s happened on over 60,000 well sites in Michigan. So, we engaged the DNR and two energy companies in a study of the best methods for reforesting abandoned oil pads, because they don’t reforest themselves. We just completed the field work on that. My goal is that this work will be submitted [for publication in an academic journal] in early 2020.So, we recognize that we’re part of the problem. And this, I think, is the more significant problem than just the fact that the oil came out of the ground — the fact that you’ve changed the system. So, we’re working with energy companies and the DNR to find a way to put those sites back into a forest ecosystem, and then to publish that so it’s accessible and shared with the whole scientific and conservation community. So that is an appropriate act of our repentance. And the third reason why I admit I don’t feel great angst is when we consider how Au Sable acquired the endowment: It didn’t come from any scheming or deception or any kind of contractual ploy. It happened because Au Sable’s founder, acting as a disciple of Jesus Christ, very intentionally went about loving somebody that nobody else loved. Express: I know a lot of what you do here has a national or international focus, but you also dedicate a lot of time to educating children from all over northern Michigan. Tell me about that. Van Dyke: There’s all kinds of local engagement. One is the Environmental Leadership Intensive Program, a professional development program for current or post-graduate students who are especially interested in environmental education and in working in and someday leading a not-for-profit organization. So, they teach K–12 students from home, parochial, and public schools all around us in northern Michigan. And when they’re not teaching, they’re actively engaged with the staff in lessons about how not-for-profits are organized, how they’re led, what kind of skills you need, how they’re budgeted, so that when the person leaves, we want them to be able to be a good teacher, but also be a good staffer in an environmental organization. The teaching aspect goes back to the very beginning of the institute, and over 130,000 people have gone through the environmental program here on this campus to learn about creation care. Express: Do you ever encounter conflicts as a Christian organization that works a lot with public schools? Van Dyke: No. In the public school, we’re going to present the knowledge and skills and techniques needed to care for God’s creation even if the school doesn’t acknowledge that’s what it is and calls it nature, which is okay. Now, when we work in other contexts, where it’s explicitly important for them to know our mission, then we are explicit about that, and our mission is one that we state as “Au Sable inspires and educates people to serve, protect and restore God’s Earth.” And then all of the theological basis behind that has also been an important work of the institute. But we don’t encounter conflict, because we are engaged in doing work that God wants us to do, but our work in that setting is not to evangelize the students; it’s to do the work. Express: Does having your mission based on Christianity lead to any notable difference between the Au Sable Institute and secular environmental groups? Van Dyke: We have a lot of similarities and shared goals and aspirations, and sometimes, when we work together, some shared achievements. We have differences in what we think are the key foundational pillars of what we are doing. I would say from a Christian standpoint, there are five: We affirm biblically that all of creation is good; that is the issue of moral value. We affirm that, with moral value, there is appropriate moral agency in human beings, and the right response is to serve and protect, which comes to us from Genesis 2:15: “The Lord God took the man and put him the Garden of Eden to serve it and to protect it.” We affirm the capacity and the responsibility and authority of human beings to actually do the work — that’s the capacity that comes from being made in the image of God, so you have the capacity to be a reflective interactant with other creatures. You can understand what their needs are and act on that. And the authority to act as a representative of God — not in physical likeness, but in personal presence — and pursue the same aims that He would have for the good of his creation. And the fifth pillar is that we have redemptive hope. Our work has significance because all of creation is included in God’s plan of redemption and restoration, and so we don’t have to be filled with despair if we save this endangered species today, and it becomes extinct in 10 years. That would be tragic, but it’s not a basis for despair, nor is it even to be expected because we affirm and believe hopefully that God has a plan for restoring his creation, and we are acting congruently. So those are differences. Express: I can see also that there must be a lot of overlap, also, because your objectives are going to be mostly similar. Van Dyke: Yeah. There’s overlap there. I think one of the biggest differences is we are willing to ask a question that a lot of conservation organizations aren’t willing to ask, and that’s the “So, what?” question. So, what if we accomplish this and maybe it turns out badly in 10 years or 20? We answer that by saying there is significance to our work because it’s cooperative with and congruent with a long-term eternal destiny for creation. It’s not work that’s done in vain. Express: What happens when you encounter conflicts between Scripture and science? Van Dyke: Well, we don’t fundamentally encounter those conflicts. I mean, if you’re talking about a literal interpretation of six days of creation, you know, that might be a conflict if we felt compelled to adopt that view, but that’s one of many interpretations of that part of Genesis, and has been for centuries, going back to Augustine. So we see no conflict there because we’re affirming the truth of the Genesis narrative that creation is an act of God; it didn’t create itself, it doesn’t sustain itself, and it doesn’t have goodness in itself. Its goodness is imparted to it and made a part of it by God. So, no. In terms of specifics, we don’t experience and see conflicts between science and Scripture. Science is not designed to answer the questions that Scripture is answering. Express: Tell me about how you went from being a Montana conservation officer to the director of Au Sable. Van Dyke: For the record, I wasn’t a conservation officer, although I helped them sometimes in law enforcement. I was a wildlife research biologist. I had spent a little time in academia before that at a small Christian college in Indiana, then five years in Montana, then back to academia at a Christian college in northwestern Iowa, then to Wheaton [College, in Illinois]. I think in that whole spread I was always trying to express my faith in what I did and what I said and what I wrote. So, I published a lot of scientific studies, but I also wrote books about Christian ethics and environmental care. One’s called “Redeeming Creation,” and the other is called “Between Heaven and Earth.” Those are two of the best known. I also was trying to contribute to my own field, so I produced a textbook in conservation biology. Express: It seems like you had these two things that made you ideal for your current position. Van Dyke: It gave me some positive characteristics. There were other people that were considered, so I’m grateful and pleased the trustees finally selected me, but I think all I was really trying to do my whole life was be myself. I wasn’t trying to impress one side or the other by being something other than what I was. It is odd, because sometimes you don’t know quite where you fit in, but Au Sable is one place where I do. Express: What do you consider the most pressing environmental issue facing northern Lower Michigan? Van Dyke: We have several. Maybe you’ve heard there’s going to be a septic summit, in Traverse City on Nov. 6. Fifty states in the U.S., and there’s only one that doesn’t have a statewide septic ordinance. Yet Michigan defines itself by its water. “Four out of five Great Lakes prefer Michigan” — you can see that on bumper stickers. Right here, we’re within 40 minutes of the headwaters of six rivers. Two major fish hatcheries are within 40 minutes. One is a federal fish hatchery, and one is a state fish hatchery. The state fish hatchery, in Grayling, is probably about 35–40 minutes away. Most of the people living in the North are living on wells on their own property. Nevertheless, septic ordinances that regulate septic fields and their septic tanks is the only thing — if they exist at all — that stand between them and the pollution of the water they drink. So that’s a major issue for Michigan to address. A second problem is the restoration of vacated well and gas pads. We’ve got 60,000 of those — that’s probably close to 120,000 acres of land — and yet there’s no systemic plan as to how that land is going to be restored and to what purpose. That’s starting — I don’t want to give the DNR a bad name, they are startingto do it — but it still has a long way to go. And the third is to remove any significant threat from Pipeline 5 [Enbridge energy company’s expired pipeline that carries petroleum from western Canada to eastern Canada through the Straits of Mackinaw], either through some kind of underground technology or shutting it down. Express: What worldwide environmental issue concerns you the most? Van Dyke: Climate — well, two things. I was about to say climate change, and that’s still true, but climate change is really now one of a number of anthropogenic affects. You may know that even the official geologic societies are considering renaming the current epoch, because human beings are no longer just a disturbance that we have to mitigate. Humans are the driving force, geologically, biologically, ecologically, and climatologically. There are only perhaps 20 percent of ice-free terrestrial lands today that could be classed as wildlands or natural environments. Everything else is either human-inhabited or strongly human modified. So even the old maps of global ecosystems are, for most of the world, obsolete — no longer useful. So, what you’ve got to do is really figure out is not how to treat humans as a "disturbance," and then remove the disturbance from the system. Humans beings are no longer "disturbing" natural systems; they are shaping them, because human beings are driving the system, so you have to figure out how you do conservation in a human-dominated nature. That’s the big global issue, can you have a responsible Anthropocene [epoch]? Now, climate change is one of the biggest drivers. It’s one of the most pervasive anthropogenic effects, and it affects all conservation planning today. So, it’s probably the No. 1 hazard to deal with, because your risk is so high and is already materializing into a hazard. You’re already seeing the hazardous effects of climate change. Express: Do you find it frustrating that more Christians don’t think the way you do about this? Van Dyke: I guess I don’t dwell on it to think of it as a frustration. It’s one more problem to solve. There are many Christians who are active and quite eloquent. There are whole Christian organizations dedicated entirely to conservation, some dedicated entirely to climate change. I think that the larger body of evangelicals in the United States will have to at some point decide we’re going to be more discerning about individual issues and less tribal. Because there’s always a tendency of people to gravitate together to someone who holds out the promise that they will increase your influence — especially when you’re feeling your influence in society is being taken away by other sources. So, in that sense, evangelicals as a political group tend to be linked together with a constellation of issues. That’s not entirely unjustified, but some of it is, because some of the more in-depth surveys reveal that only about half of the voters who identify themselves as evangelicals actually hold evangelical beliefs. Why that half wants to be identified as evangelical, I’m still puzzled. Express: Are you saying that there are evangelicals out there that claim the political end of the movement but don’t care about the spiritual side of it? Van Dyke: Yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying. And there’s a lot of them. And the media often overlook very prominent evangelicals doing good work.

 The folks I have met volunteering for environmental causes come from all walks of life. There’s some who spend their days looking through microscopes, some crunching numbers, some wiping noses. Some are retired, while others are still figuring out what they want to be when they grow up. Some of us spend our weekends following rivers and trails; others follow fantasy football.Our one commonality is our concern for where humanity is heading — and our desire to do something about it. What we do takes many forms. I try to keep it simple and focus on three questions:1) What will I do today? I will do something. I will not do nothing. Some days it will be a tiny thing: Call my member of Congress, buy local food, turn off the lights. Some days it will be a bigger thing: Make a donation, look for common ground with someone more conservative, plant a native species. Some days it will be a really big thing: Lobby my member of Congress, volunteer in Flint, stop yelling at the radio.2) What do I need to know?This one is trickier. I need to know enough to make sure what I do is effective, but I don’t always have time for what that might be. I try to learn as much as I can, but this question could instead become this: Who do I trust for the best information? Most of my fellow volunteers couldn’t explain the biology of lifeless soil or list the chemicals in fracking waste. We might not get the physics of shore erosion or the economics that allows Nestle to pump water from under our feet and truck it around the world. We don’t know much about designing a storm drain or the engineering that would keep a family’s home standing in 185 mile per hour winds. What we do know is to trust scientists who study the environment and our impact on it. We know to listen to what they have to say — about how to prevent things, fix things, and do better. The science that we trusted as we built modern society, cured disease, and went into space is the same science that is now telling us, “Whoa!” It is people using the same transparent, peer-reviewed research methods, driven by the same passion for knowledge, discovery, and truth. 3) Who else can I get to help?Anyone, everyone, whoever is ready. Are you ready? What will get you there? Sometimes environmentalism suffers under the weight of its own imagery — majestic mountain forests, the ubiquitous polar bear floating on the melting sea ice, the bald eagle saved from pesticides. What the logos miss is that what we are saving is ourselves. The natural world we seek to rescue is not “out there.” It is passing through our lungs, pouring from our faucets, and sitting on our plates. This reality is more apparent for those who will face it sooner, more severely, and who are least equipped to handle it. As a social service provider, I’m less moved by rain forests or polar bears than by the wheezing three-year-old who can’t breathe the air in his neighborhood. And that he or someone else in his family could be one of the 200,000 premature deaths caused by air pollution in the U.S. every year. It bothers me that people still live in places considered to be “cancer alleys,” or where air smells like gas fumes from refineries, or like ammonia from large-scale poultry operations. What keeps me up is wondering where thousands of Bahamians are sleeping tonight. It is one legacy of segregation and racism we need to face that, as the National Defense Council states, “Communities of color, which are often poor, are routinely targeted to host facilities that have negative environmental impacts.” Minority groups are disproportionately impacted by natural disasters, weather extremes, and food insecurity.Native Americans face similar challenges with disruption and pollution from extractive industries and agribusiness encroaching on their land and water resources.None of these problems exists in a vacuum. For solutions to work, they will have to work for everyone, requiring diverse voices led by those whose lives and economic well-being are most affected. This basic tenet of the Green New Deal is gaining traction and discussion in an ever-growing and coalescing movement. If one feels discouraged by the current administration’s seemingly endless rollbacks of environmental protections and assaults on human rights, remember this: Not that long ago, talking about environmental issues, especially climate change, was generally considered anti-business and pretty much political suicide. This year, even in this charged and divided political atmosphere, CNN ran seven hours of programming devoted exclusively to presidential candidates’ climate plans. This wouldn’t have been possible if people weren’t connecting the dots. Inclusion and innovation not only will transition us to a clean energy world but also to a just and prosperous one.

 Coal is neither beautiful nor clean. It is now and always has been the most destructive fossil fuel to extract, and the dirtiest to burn. Even with new technology that tries to scrub out pollutants, coal is still filthy. Now, after more than two centuries of causing death, coal itself is dying. The United States still has more than 8,600 coal-fired power plants that produce at least one megawatt of power. They provide 27 percent of our total power output. But that number is shrinking — more than 200 coal plants have shuttered since 2010 — and will continue to do so. Some plants are being replaced by natural gas, some by renewables, and some aren't being replaced by anything. Coal will not be missed by most of us, and for good reason. In 2016, the last year for which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has, or is willing to share, data, coal burning produced a cornucopia of dangerous and unwanted toxins. For example, coal burning plants produced 576,185 tonsof carbon monoxide, 197,286 tonsof particulates of the sort that get into our lungs, 82,400 pounds of lead, 77,108 pounds of arsenic, 45,676 pounds of mercury (42 percent of all the mercury pollution), and 9,332 pounds of cadmium, not to mention more than a million tons of sulfur dioxide. All of it is either carcinogenic or known to cause pulmonary disease and respiratory distress. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 30,000 Americans die directly from particulate pollution every year. Even the Trump Administration's wholesale deregulation of coal plants, which reversed efforts to curb both end-product pollution and environmental damage during extraction, won't be enough to save coal. It earned votes in coal country, but the industry is gasping its last, a fitting end to something that caused so many to do the same. Though our lungs and our land will benefit from coal's demise, the cause has very little to do with a response to climate change, pressure from environmentalists, or even a faint concern for the environment or our health. It's way simpler than that. The economics of coal is no longer tenable. Natural gas is now much cheaper and, as a bonus, burns much cleaner than coal. Renewables like wind and solar are cheaper still — less than a fifth the cost of coal. The decline of coal has the added benefit of a cessation to the unimaginable environmental destruction caused by coal mining. Nearby streams and wetlands are destroyed, wastewater ponds leach into groundwater and frequently erupt beyond their man-made levees, coal dust destroys nearby woodlands and, of course, the mine workers themselves are exposed to life-threatening pollutants daily. What the EPA should have stopped long ago will now, finally, be stopped by economics. This is a death that will benefit the vast majority of us but not everybody. Some coal industry workers will be left behind, absent some help. Coal mining operations, which employed more than 863,000 less than a century ago, now use less than 50,000. But that's still a significant economic demographic, men and women who will be without jobs and untrained for anything else. A good example is the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-burning power plant outside of Page, Arizona, on the Navajo Nation. Operated by the Salt River Project (SRP), a quasi-governmental utility, the Navajo Generating Station is shutting down. Some of the plant's 500 employees will transfer to other SRP power plants, but most will simply be out of a job. And the 300 employed at the Peabody coal mine that provides the fuel will also be laid off. Not huge numbers in the overall picture but devastating on the Navajo Nation, where unemployment hovers around 45 percent, and 43 percent of the residents live below the poverty line. It's a scenario being played out around the country where mines are located in economically distressed regions. There is a solution for displaced miners, though one not likely to be undertaken. At least some of the environmental damage around coal mines can be mitigated. The piles of toxic waste can be removed to a safer landfill designed to hold such substances. Streams can be cleaned. Waste ponds can be drained. The landscape can be restored to some semblance of what nature created. It would require re-training but provide useful employment for many displaced miners for a very long time because there is much work to be done. And, yup, the federal government should pay for the work since the federal government allowed this environmental destruction to take place. There is apparently a bottomless pit of available money, deficits be damned, so we should spend some to fix the damage we've created. Coal's condition is terminal. No amount of deregulation will save it. Some residual coal dust will be all that's left.

 Four bills state legislators passed during its lame duck session have transformed Michigan’s environmental policy.One sweeping new law prevents the state from enacting environmental standards that are stricter than federal standards, except in certain cases. Another rolled back wetlands regulations. A third made it harder for state regulators to react to scientific developments when measuring hazardous contamination. A fourth bill enabled the construction of a tunnel for the Line 5 pipeline at the Straits of Mackinac, a move decried by opponents who have fought to have the 66-year-old pipeline removed. “WRITTEN BY SPECIAL INTERESTS”For environmentalists in northern Michigan, the passage of the laws marks a particularly dark time for the state.Christopher Grobbel, a former DEQ staffer and owner of Grobbel Environmental & Planning Associates, an environmental and land use planning firm in Leelanau, says he was appalled that the legislature would vote to reshape the state’s environmental policy and undo, during a lame-duck session “at the 12th hour, literally, on the way out of the door, ”decades of lawsthat were often crafted through bipartisan compromise and consensus.Michigan has a history of strong environmental regulation, Grobbel says. “This is really a major step backward.”Dave Dempsey, who served as an environmental advisor to former Gov. Jim Blanchard and is a senior advisor at Traverse City-based FLOW, a Great Lakes advocacy group, says the laws mark “the biggest steps back in environmental politics in Michigan in decades.”Environmental protection has historically been important to Michigan citizens, Dempsey says. There was a long track record of conservation and environmental stewardship that crossed party lines and led to pioneering measures to protect the state’s natural resources.That started to change in the 1990s, Dempsey says, as politics became more polarized, and the conservative movement shifted away from support of environmental policies. The 2018 laws mark the consequences of that shift that began in the 1990s.“The way it happened was undemocratic and sneaky,” Dempsey says. “It was an exercise in placating special interests; the bills were written by special interests, and they were products of right wing-think tanks and lobbyist.” A CHECK ON REGULATORSSen. Wayne Schmidt (R-Traverse City) voted for three of the laws; he didn’t vote for the “no stricter than federal” bill, he says, because he believes that one went too far. Nonetheless, he said it is an exaggeration to say that the laws constitute a reversal of course for environmental regulation in Michigan.“I think that Michigan continues to have strong considerations for the environment and conservation,” Schmidt says.He says the new laws serve as a check on regulators who, in some cases, have gone too far in enforcing environmental laws.Jason Hayes, director of environmental policy at Midland-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank, strongly disagrees that the laws meant Michigan was abandoning environmental regulation. He believes the laws are good for property rights and business while still enabling the state to regulate the environment.“They enforce transparency on the government, which is always a good thing, and they respect private property rights, and they allow businesses to do what they need to do, which is good for the economy,” Hayes says.In addition, he says, the laws still enable Michigan to enforce environmental rules; they just make it harder for regulators to overreach.“All three of those provide safety valves for the government,” he says. A BIG THREAT TO WATERFrom Dempsey’s perspective, the worst of the four laws passed during the lame-duck session was HB 4205, the bill that mandates Michigan environmental standards can be no stricter than federal standards.Michigan has historically been a leader in taking action on toxic chemicals, Dempsey says, and HB 4205 repudiates that tradition.“Michigan was the first state to cancel most uses of DDT, which put us ahead of the rest of the country,” he says. “We are, in essence, throwing away that legacy with this law. … We cannot know what the next toxic emergency is going to be, but when it comes, it’s going to be very difficult for Michigan to take appropriate action.”Liz Kirkwood, executive director of FLOW, says the “no stricter than federal” law is especially hard to stomach now, as the state faces threats from PFAs, a diverse group of contaminants that don’t degrade and can therefore migrate and pose a threat to drinking water over years or decades.The new laws, along with SB 1244, which will make it harder for regulators to enact stricter standards for contamination based on peer-reviewed science, are going to pose a challenge to regulators trying to keep drinking water safe from PFAs, said TJ Andrews, legal counsel at Watershed Center Grand Traverse Bay.Andrews says the “no stricter than federal” law is particularly alarming in light of what’s happening at the EPA under the Trump Administration, which has expressed contempt for environmental regulations.“It seems like it’s part of a broader conspiracy, right?” Andrews says. “Let’s slash it at the federal level, and then make sure the states can’t do any better.”Grobbel says he fears that, by barring Michigan from having any higher-than-federal environmental standards, the law could throw a significant portion of the state’s environmental regulation into limbo.In many instances, the DEQ has been allowed to enforce federal law because the state’s standards are stricter under a standard called “primacy,” Grobbel said.On wetlands, for example, the federal government has historically acknowledged the state’s higher standards by handing over enforcement of federal law to state officials.Now that Michigan no longer has “primacy” to take control over federal environmental standards, Grobbel says he doesn’t know who will be responsible for environmental regulation going forward.“It’s always been the case in Michigan, even under Republican governors, that we wanted to keep that closer to home rather than rely on the Chicago EPA,” says Grobbel. “Now, instead of relying on ourcriteria, we’re going to default to the federal criteria to determine which wetlands are regulated.” CONCERNS “A LITTLE OVER THE TOP”Hayes says those fears over the “no stricter than federal” bill are overblown.Gov. Snyder vetoed an earlier version of the bill several years ago; this time he signed it.Hayes says that’s because Snyder required that the law contain a less strict threshold for state regulators to prove a need for stronger standards. That means that in the event of an emergency, state regulators will be able to step in.“Initially when it was written, they had to provide a clear and convincing case for a more strict regulations,” he says. In the version that passed, they have to show a need through a preponderance of evidence.In the case of something like PFAs, Hayes says that, since those are not regulated by the federal government, the state standards would remain intact.He says he isn’t concerned that Michigan is aligning with federal standards, even as the EPA is reinventing itself in the age of Trump.“The notion that the state of Michigan is just chucking environmental regulations out the door and the baby’s going out with the bathwater, I think, is a little over the top,” Hayes says.He says he believes the EPA became too aggressive under Obama administration control, and the Trump administration is correcting that.“The EPA is focusing where they’re supposed to be,” he says.Along with Schmidt, Rep. Larry Inman (R-Traverse City) also voted against the “no stricter” bill.“We are surrounded by the Great Lakes, and we have a lot of inland lakes and inland rivers, so we’re kind of in a special state where we’re surrounded by fresh water,” he says. “There could be instances where we need stricter than federal regulations.”Inman said though he is a Republican, he weighs environmental bills carefully and is willing to listen to environmental groups.“They are not shy about calling the office,” Inman says. “I would say that they are really a great resource. In the era of term limits, they have a sense of history a lot of times.”Inman voted for the wetlands bill, which, although it is also decried by environmental groups, was drastically altered between when it was introduced and when it passed, making it much less severe.“Every bill that comes before us, when it first comes out, a lot of times it comes with a lot of controversy, so we get a lot of phone calls in our office from constituents,” Inman says. “The legislative process softens up the bill.” QUESTIONS OVER WETLANDSAndrews agrees that the final version of the wetlands bill, SB 1211, isn’t nearly as bad as an earlier version of the bill, which would have reclassified the minimum size for “regulated” wetlands from five acres to 10 acres, a move that might have put as many as a half million acres of wetlands out of regulation in the state.Heather Smith, the Watershed Center’s baykeeper, says the law will make it harder to investigate violations because of new burdens the law foists upon already stretched-out DEQ staff. For example, the law requires that if the DEQ wants to investigate an alleged wetland violation on private property, they have to get a search warrant.“It makes it harder to investigate violations,” she says.Grobbel says another significant change in the new law is that now, only wetlands contiguous with bodies of water are regulated; it used to be that wetlands within 1,000 feet of the Great Lakes or 500 feet of an inland lake or waterway were regulated.Up North, that’s going to affect a lot of property, and it’s going to make a lot of wetlands unregulated.“The big message out of this is they try to put a spike into the whole notion of regulating isolated wetlands,” Grobbel says. “We’re going to have a number of areas that are going to lose protection that are wetlands. Small, isolated wetlands, but ecologically and hydrologically important wetlands.”That doesn’t necessarily mean a lot of land that couldn’t be developed will suddenly be developable, however, Grobbel says. Even under the old laws, an application to fill wetlands was virtually never denied.Rather, DEQ regulators would work with the landowner or developer to determine how a project could move forward with the least harm done to the wetlands, and then issue the permit.What the new law means, Grobbel says, is that in a lot of cases, that kind of harm mitigation will no longer have to take place, and those wetlands will just get filled — ultimately at the expense of the region’s water quality.“If you’re a banker or a developer, you probably love it,” Grobbel says. COMPLAINTS OVER DEQ ENFORCEMENTInman says he liked the final version of the wetlands bill: “I thought it was a fair balance.” He says DEQ staff can sometimes be overzealous.Schmidt also supported the wetlands bill, even in its earlier, more severe form.“I was thankful they scaled it back, even though I voted for the first, much more drastic version,” he says.Schmidt says he heard complaints about the way the DEQ enforced environmental regulations, and he thinks this law will make it clearer what is and what is not allowed.“There seems to be or has been inconsistencies within the department,” Schmidt says. “We tried to get it so people know exactly what the rules are.”Hayes agreed that wetlands enforcement at the DEQ could be overzealous, and he said this law was needed.“There’s examples where we have helped defend property owners who have been unreasonably regulated in terms of wetlands use,” Hayes says.Hayes cited one example of a Grand Rapids business owner whom the DEQ refused permission to construct an employee parking lot because of a wetland that Hayes contends was, in fact, wet ground due to snow melt. He said that led to a legal case that went on for years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.Hayes said the bill by no means will mean the wholesale destruction of wetlands.“We’re maintaining standards, we’re still maintaining wetlands, but at the same time, we’re protecting landowners,” he says.Kirkwood hopes the bill doesn’t result in too much wetlands destruction. The value of wetlands to society is not always evident or obvious, but they serve many crucial functions.“We know that wetlands have incredible economic and ecological benefits for us,” Kirkwood says.Wetlands mitigate flooding during severe weather, they serve as wildlife incubators, and they abate pollution and protect water resources.“They can’t be perceived as swamp any more — they serve a vital role in urban and suburban and rural communities,” she says. Area environmentalists are also alarmed over SB 1197, which authorizes the construction of a tunnel for Line 5 at the Straits of Mackinac andcreated the Mackinac Straits Tunnel Authority.The promise of a tunnel doesn’t quell fears over the danger posed by the aging pipeline; it might be a decade before the tunnel is completed, and in the meantime, the oil line will remain in operation.“I think it would be difficult to say that a modern, well-built tunnel presents the same water quality threat as a 60-year-old pipeline,” Andrews says. “But I would say, from a water quality perspective, it’s the length of time leaving the pipeline there that’s the bigger threat.”Traverse City’s Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities is also opposed to the tunnel plan.In a statement opposing the tunnel, Jim Lively, Groundwork’s policy director, argues that letting the pipeline run for 10 more years as-is poses too big a threat; that Michigan doesn’t need the oil transported in the pipeline; and, in fact, most of it returns to Canada through Sarnia. He called the “process for crafting and passing the tunnel deal … rushed, secretive, and likely unconstitutional.”Gov. Whitmer asked Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office to research questions about the tunnel deal; Kirkwood said FLOW is assisting in that research.“We do not litigate. However, the attorney general has asked for legal advice and analysis,” she says. “Enbridge (the Canadian company that owns the pipeline) continues to be an unworthy and distrusted tenant, and so the state of Michigan has legal authority and a duty to ensure that it upholds its fiduciary public trustee duties to the citizens of Michigan.”Hayes says he believes pipelines are safer alternatives to other means of transporting oil and that Line 5 delivers fuel that’s needed in Michigan. Although Line 5 opponents argue that much of Line 5’s load passes through Michigan and goes back into Canada through Sarnia, Hayes says that a lot of that oil is refined there and then returns to Michigan as gasoline.Hayes says he shares the concern over the age of the pipeline and also worries that something could happen in the 10 years before a tunnel is completed.“What you do is, you do your darndest to make sure it doesn’t happen,” he says.Schmidt voted in favor of the tunnel. Inman voted against it, but he said only because of how long it’s going to take to build.“I can live with a tunnel. I can live with some advancement of utilities going through that tunnel,” he says. “The biggest concern that I had was the seven to 10 years” delay. A Bright Side for Environmentalists — One That Didn’t Pass.One bill that failed was one Traverse City environmentalists followed closely — it would have prevented localities from writing ordinances to protect trees, and was proposed just as Traverse City was debating whether to establish such an ordinance.The bill was supported by the Traverse City Area Chamber of Commerce, and Sen. Wayne Schmidt (R-Traverse City) was a sponsor of an amendment to the would-be law.“We were disappointed that the chamber was involved, and that Wayne Schmidt was the sponsor of one of the tagalong [bills],” says TJ Andrews, legal counsel for Watershed Center Grand Traverse Bay.The tree ordinance discussion arose following the massive tree-cutting at the Moorings development, on the west end of the city.“The planning commission was specifically inquiring of staff, saying, ‘Where’s our tree protection?’” Andrews says. “And staff were saying, ‘We just don’t have any,” and the planning commission said, ‘Well, we need one. Let’s make it a priority.’”As the Watershed Center worked to help Traverse City draft an ordinance, the law was proposed in the state legislature, which Andrews found underhanded.“There was a lot of discussion when the tree ordinance was first presented to the planning commission, and there was some argument that this was not the result of a public process, and you had too few stakeholders sitting at the table,” she says. “So, we sat down with the chamber. Their position was that more public input was needed to get a better ordinance.”But ultimately the chamber and Schmidt supported a state law that would have put an end to the discussion.Schmidt says he supported the law because he heard from constituents who were worried about how much the tree ordinance would cost.Schmidt says the law wasn’t introduced in reaction to Traverse City’s tree ordinance proposal; he says there were a couple downstate communities also debating tree ordinances. He says some of the tree ordinances under consideration were too severe and “were going to be extremely punitive, especially in an urban area where you want to concentrate development.”Nonetheless, Schmidt does not expect the bill to be re-introduced this sessionAndrews hopes Traverse City can pass something now that the bill failed.What she and the Watershed helped create was a framework for a tree policy that could be made as strict or as loose as city commissioners want, she says. Essentially, an ordinance would say that if you cut down a big old tree, something has to be replanted.“It should be done, and someone is going to have to brave and say that this is an issue that this community is going to address,” she says.

 When an anchor strike punctured an underwater pipe in the Straits of Mackinac on April 1, releasing an estimated 600 gallons of a petroleum-based fluid into the Great Lakes from an electrical transmission line, the response was hampered by extreme weather. Opponents of Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 oil pipeline fear the incident shows that responders aren’t ready for a catastrophe; meanwhile, Enbridge and U.S. Coast Guard officials say the reaction proved they are prepared to staunch an incident before it becomes dangerous. Whichever side is right could one day be critical to Michigan’s economy; a Michigan State University professor just released a study that concluded a Line 5 oil spill at the Straits of Mackinac could cost the state more than $6 billion. A STRAITS OF MACKINAC OIL SPILLA tugboat — the Clyde S. VanEnkevort — allegedly caused the April 1 failure of the American Transmission Company line. It had dragged an anchor that punctured underwater pipes carrying power cables, prompting a leak of the fluid used to insulate those cables into the Straits. The fluid has been variously described as anything from the seemingly harmless “mineral oil” to the more toxic-sounding “dielectric fluid.” Either way, everyone hopes that by now the substance has dissipated into the lake and vanished as a threat to human and animal health. The leak was discovered April 1 and reported to the Coast Guard the following day, a lag that concerns Line 5 opponents. In the days that followed, severe winter weather that persisted through early April made it difficult for responders to assess and address the spill. Perhaps more alarmingly, the same vessel’s anchor apparently struck and damaged one of the two Line 5 pipelines, too. Each of those lines carries as much as 11 million gallons of oil across the Straits per day. The anchor strikes occurred just weeks before Traverse City-based For Love of Water released the results of a study it had commissioned to estimate the impact a Line 5 failure would have on the state’s economy. Michigan State University ecological economist Dr. Robert Richardson conducted the study. FLOW’s executive director, Liz Kirkwood, said she was grateful to be talking about the hypothetical impact of a Line 5 failure rather than an actual catastrophe. “That an anchor potentially struck and hit Line 5 and didn’t cause a rupture, I think, is miraculous,” Kirkwood said. Kirkwood said that when FLOW commissioned Richardson’s report last year, they started out considering an anchor strike to be among the threats to Line 5’s integrity. At the time, that seemed odd to some observers, Kirkwood said, because conventional wisdom had it that a combination of corrosion and human error were the biggest threats to the pipeline. “I remember people’s reaction, which was, ‘Well, that’s odd. I mean, why aren’t they talking about corrosion?’” she said. That the ATC pipeline was struck and leaked into the Straits should serve as a warning shot, she said. “I think it drives home the reality of what a catastrophic spill could look like,” she said. “It’s the precursor of what would happen.” WHAT WE LEARNEDWhat the ATC spill taught us, Kirkwood said, is that responding to an environmental emergency in the Straits of Mackinac can offer unexpected challenges. It took a day for the ATC rupture to be reported and by then, due to weather and the passage of time, there was apparently little that could be done to clean up the spill. “I think we learned that, number one, the reporting time can be very significantly delayed,” Kirkwood said. “In this particular case, it took ATC almost 24 hours to report.” Another ominous lesson learned from ATC, Kirkwood said, is that in the event a Line 5 failure were to occur during extreme weather conditions, response to the spill could be crippled. After the ATC spill, days went by before a boat could be launched to survey the area, she said. “There were no boats that were able to go out to assess and contain this spill, and so you had 600 gallons that ended up just diluting into the Great Lakes, and that’s sort of the best that we can hope for,” Kirkwood said. Kirkwood said she heard ATC executives describe the early April weather following the spill as “extraordinary,” and she said she found that disturbing because extreme weather events around the Straits of Mackinac are not extraordinary ­— they are commonplace throughout the year. For example, the Mackinac Bridge is routinely closed to traffic during periods of high winds. Kirkwood recalls hearing an anecdote from a Line 5 researcher who said that while he was working in the field, his team split up on each side of the bridge. “He said, ‘We couldn’t even cross the bridge to communicate with the other part of our team,’” Kirkwood said. “High wind conditions could prevent responders from crossing the bridge.” The FLOW/MSU study did not take into account how severe weather and ice cover could hamper the response. Kirkwood said the cost of a Line 5 failure amid harsh winter conditions could be far worse than what the study imagined. “Everything that you think is going to be easy could be the opposite and could be very, very difficult,” Kirkwood said. “Presumably, the price tag would go up, because the longer that you have oil in the open waters without it being contained, the more likely it is to actually come to shore. When you look at the cost of an oil spill, once you hit land, the cost goes up very significantly.” RESPONSE FROM ENBRIDGEThe FLOW/MSU study estimates that a Line 5 failure might release 2.5 million gallons of oil into Lake Michigan and Lake Huron in a better-than-worse-case-scenario. The cost of cleanup and the economic effects of the loss of tourism, damage to drinking water infrastructure and fisheries, and reduction in property values could cost Michigan billions. “If a rupture were to occur, it is possible that automatic response valves would be triggered, and a release of oil could be of a lesser magnitude,” Robertson wrote in the report. “However, it is also possible that a failure of those valves and an extended delay in response, such as those experienced in pipeline ruptures, could lead to a release of oil of a far greater magnitude than this scenario, with economic damages well in excess of the estimates in this report.” Ryan Duffy, a Lansing-based Enbridge spokesman, said the FLOW study is “fundamentally flawed.” “It is based on an unrealistic volume of product potentially released. Enbridge has done extensive safety and risk planning on Line 5,” Duffy said in an email. “Our analysis indicates a potential worst-case discharge at the Straits of Mackinac is approximately 5,000 barrels, which is less than one-tenth the volume assumed in this study.” Moreover, automatic shut-off valves would stop the flow of oil once there is a drop in pressure in the line caused by a leak, he said. There are automatic shut-off valves located on both sides of the pipelines that are capable of shutting off the line within minutes. “We would immediately activate containment and clean-up equipment and crews,” Duffy said. Duffy said Enbridge is working with the state of Michigan to find ways to mitigate the risks posed by anchor strikes, including using a tunnel underneath the Straits to move the line away from where it can be hit by anchors. The tunnel plan, worked out between Enbridge and Gov. Rick Snyder, is considered a betrayal by many Line 5 opponents, who want the pipes removed from the Straits entirely. Asked what he thinks the response to the ATC spill demonstrated about how prepared Enbridge and the state and federal responders would be in the event of a Line 5 failure, Duffy wrote: “Our focus, 24/7, is on spill prevention. In the unlikely event of an incident we have the training, the people and resources to respond quickly to a release in the Straits of Mackinac. We have equipment positioned near the Straits to enable access, containment, and removal of oil. We have also practiced our winter spill response plans in real-life winter conditions in the Straits of Mackinac. That experience will help us in the event of a spill.” A message left at ATC inquiring about the apparent day-long lag between when the April 1 spill occurred and when it was reported to authorities was not returned. In a press release, the Coast Guard described the Unified Command’s ATC response as a success: “‘Since the beginning of this response, the Unified Command, together with the many federal, state, local and tribal partners, worked diligently to mitigate any pollution threat to our Straits and precious wildlife, and to be transparent in our efforts,’ said Cmdr. Shaun Edwards, Incident Commander. ‘Although our mission is complete, we all remain committed to learning the cause this incident and doing our best to eliminate any threat of something like this happening again.’” INJURED BIRD REPORTSWildlife photographer Lynn Fraze first learned about Line 5 when she attended a meeting about it at Petoskey High School in 2011, long before “Shut Down Line 5 Pipeline” yard signs proliferated across northern Michigan. Fraze said she was alarmed when she approached the building and found it secured by police officers. They were apparently there in case there was trouble from people wanting to protest the Enbridge Kalamazoo oil spill, a 2010 event that saw nearly a million gallons of oil flow into the regional river system and cost more than a billion dollars to clean up. “There was a couple that stood up at the end of the meeting, and they tried to talk about the Kalamazoo spill and they said, ‘If you don’t do something about this pipeline, you’re all going to be really sorry,’” Fraze recalled. “And the police officers came in and escorted them out.” Today, Fraze said she is disturbed by her perception that authorities are downplaying and minimizing the severity of the ATC spill. Fraze is a member of Mackinac Straits Raptor watch, which happened to be holding an annual festival in Mackinaw City on the weekend following that spill. The spill also unfolded in front of a beach where an MSRW bird watcher had been stationed to count birds since late March. The bird watcher, Adam Bradley, wrote on his blog that he learned of the spill when officials began to visit the beach and started asking him pointed questions. Fraze, who was the photography coordinator for the festival, believes that Bradley saw evidence of wildlife harmed in the spill. “Adam was saying that there had been 50 red-breasted mergansers there a couple days before that had been out on the ice and came in as a group and did excessive preening for over an hour, just in one area, trying to clean their chest area,” Fraze said. “He said in his 20-some years of observing wildlife, he’s never seen that. And so he reported that to the authorities.” A couple days after the festival, Fraze found what she considered evidence of the oil spill — a clear ice that was stained yellow, a sight she’d never seen before over decades of visiting the Mackinac Straits. “It looked to me like Vaseline, a little lighter tint than Vaseline, but it was completely clear,” she said. “I called and tried to report it to the Coast Guard. It took me over an hour. They transferred me around, ‘This is the command number you should call’; ‘No, this is the command number you should call’; ‘Oh no, you should call this number in Washington, D.C.’” She said she was finally connected to someone who took her report. Yet, in a May 8 press release, the Coast Guard said: “During the response, the Coast Guard and other agencies continually surveyed the Straits from the water, the air, and from the shoreline. There have been no reports of pollution or injured wildlife.” Petty officer Brian McCrum of the Coast Guard public affairs office in Cleveland insisted that no one reported injured wildlife to the agency. It’s possible that Bradley’s report of birds preening excessively and Fraze’s report of discolored ice were deemed inconclusive observations and therefore were not counted as reports of wildlife injury or pollution. Fraze said she remains concerns about what the spill’s long-term impact on wildlife will entail. LOWER CONSEQUENCES FOR BIRD KILLSIt just so happens that whether or not wildlife was destroyed as a result of the ATF spill is a moot point, at least as far as federal penalties are concerned. Days after the spill, the Trump administration fulfilled a pledge to gut the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, a law that was enacted in concert with other countries amid concern over several bird species that had gone extinct over a century ago. On April 11, the Interior Department issued an order that the law would no longer be used to punish the killing of birds when birds are killed as a result of any activities that are not undertaken for the purpose of killing birds. For example, unless a company caused an oil spill with the intent to kill birds, they can no longer face penalties under the MBTA for birds that are killed in an oil spill. It was a reversal of years of consensus over what is considered to be one of the county’s first environmental laws. According to the The Washington Post: “The new interpretation reverses decades of action by Republican and Democratic administrations to protect the animals as they navigate the globe.” Fraze hopes that this change in policy will not turn out to be relevant for the Straits of Mackinac bird populations. She hopes that Line 5 is decommissioned and shut down before any wildlife is threatened. “It’s common sense that they have a backup plan (to transport the oil elsewhere). Would a billion-dollar company not have a backup plan to keep the flow of oil moving?” Fraze said. “I don’t want to, as a wildlife photographer, take pictures of animals, birds primarily, covered in oil. I don’t.” Even if we did learn from the ATC spill that there are trained and competent responders ready to react at the Straits of Mackinac to a Line 5 failure, Kirkwood said, that shouldn’t be acceptable. “I think all of us are wondering, why are we trying to prepare for Enbridge’s disaster, and why is the public being burdened with this risk that is absolutely avoidable?” she said. “We will never be as prepared as we want to be, given the age, given the track record, given the extraordinary risk.” First Name: Last Name: Email Address: City: State: Also sign up to receive The Ticker: Also sign up to receive the Leelanau Ticker:

 You likely believe the primary purpose of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to, you know, protect the environment. These days you would be wrong. Since it was first created in 1970 during the Nixon Administration, the EPA has been a wonkish outfit full of scientists doing science stuff. It is, by its very nature, often at odds with major industries because it regulates much of what they can and cannot do. It should be the enemy of polluters, and it was for 46 years, regardless of who lived in the White House or controlled Congress. That has all changed since Donald Trump became president and appointed Scott Pruitt as the EPA administrator. Pruitt, the former Oklahoma Attorney General, has apparently decided the EPA's primary role is to unburden the industries it is supposed to regulate from the yoke of pesky rules. His anti-EPA crusade started when he was still in Oklahoma and sued the agency 14 times for what he considered overreaches. He won one of those cases — on a procedural issue. Now, as EPA administrator, he doesn't need the courts; he can arbitrarily change regulations as he pleases. (Not laws, but rules and regulations promulgated by those laws. Let's see ... he reduced restrictions on methane gas emissions from new oil and gas wells. Methane is an especially onerous greenhouse gas contributing to climate change but Pruitt doesn't really believe in human-caused climate change, so that's an irrelevant fact to him. He reduced restrictions on the construction of new coal-fired power plants and their toxic emissions. He told coal industry leaders “the war on coal is over.” Since coal is by far the worst air-polluting fossil fuel, that's not such good news. He tried to reduce or eliminate restrictions on the use of chemical fertilizers in the agriculture industry. We know those fertilizers leach into groundwater and run off into our streams, rivers, and lakes. The algae blooms that occasionally show up in lakes are thought to be caused by these fertilizers, and they don't do our groundwater any good, either. The courts have, at least temporarily, blocked his decision. He lifted a ban on the use of chlorpyrifos, an insecticide the EPA's own scientists believe may cause neurodevelopmental problems in children. He has placed the rules that restrict the emission of mercury and arsenic, both known poisons and carcinogens, “under review,” the step he usually takes before eliminating regulations. He was and is an ardent foe of the Paris Climate Accords or any other climate rules since, as stated before, he's not sure humans or greenhouse gas emitters are responsible. He has proposed something he calls the “speed cleanup” of Superfund pollution sites. Not to worry, though. He has appointed a former banker to head up that effort, a man banned from banking for life because he made illegal loans. That top-notch group hasn't yet done anything. Pruitt has also banned any scientists who have accepted government grants in their work from serving on any of the EPA's many advisory panels. That pretty much narrows the field to those working for the industries the EPA is supposed to be regulating, somewhat skewing results. Pruitt's solution? He disbanded most of the advisory panels, realizing the last thing he needed was a bunch of scientific facts. Altogether, Pruitt has either relaxed, eliminated, or currently has under review a whopping 67 environmental rules and regulations. He has not yet explained how any of it was done in service to the environment. He has met with the leaders of the chemical, oil, gas, coal, and agriculture communities but has avoided environmental groups altogether. None of this has much helped morale at the EPA, where 700 employees have now left, fully a quarter of them scientists. We all understand the urge of every new administration to try and attack a bloated federal bureaucracy. We know there is waste and duplication aplenty in most agencies and departments, and we'd welcome somebody actually doing something other than just talking about it. But systematically dismantling the rules that protect our environment from polluters for the benefit of those industries doing the polluting is not at all what we had in mind. Nor is ignoring the science on which those decisions should be based. Prior to the creation of the EPA, we relied on “the markets” and industry itself to protect our land, air, and water. Under the markets’ watch, 70 percent of our streams, rivers, and lakes were unsafe to drink, swim in, or eat fish from. Our air was a toxic mix of lung-disease-causing particulates and toxic gasses. We've come a long way since 1970, and most of us would not like to return to those days. Scott Pruitt, now in charge of protecting our environment, is one of the exceptions. His EPA has become Every Polluter's Ally. Just not ours. First Name: Last Name: Email Address: City: State: Also sign up to receive The Ticker: Also sign up to receive the Leelanau Ticker:

 MNA Staff Caption Close From the Lansing State Journal LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Scientists want to use an unconventional method to remove pollution at former General Motors properties near Lansing where an underground plume of chemicals is creeping toward drinking water wells. The Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust controls the former GM plants. It is proposing a remediation method called "biosparging," which removes pollution by injecting air into groundwater. The method encourages bacteria to consume 1,4-dioxane, an industrial chemical that GM used to clean oil off car parts. Should the trust gain state approval, the project would be among the first and likely the largest to use the method, the Lansing State Journal reported . It's unclear how much the project would cost, but engineers said it could take six to 12 years to fully clean the water. The pollution was discovered after the trust was established by the federal government to take over the GM sites following the company's bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. The dioxane plume is located under two former GM plants in Lansing Township and Lansing. Dave Favero, deputy cleanup manager for the Michigan properties, said dioxane is very soluble. If dioxane is in oil, as it was used at the GM plants, "it leaches out and starts to migrate with the groundwater," he said. Long-term exposure could lead to liver, kidney and reproductive problems and possibly cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Lansing-area plume is within the Lansing Board of Water and Light's wellhead protection area for some of its drinking water wells. Up to 10 of the utility's wells are downstream from the polluted groundwater. The utility started monitoring for dioxane in 2015, and found a small amount within the limits of what the EPA considers safe. The utility hasn't monitored dioxane levels that exceed the EPA's safe limit yet. The trust will need to get approval from state environmental regulators. Scientists and engineers could begin installing biosparging wells this year if the plan is approved.

 MNA Staff LANSING — Hoping for a quick thaw to escape the winter blues? Not so fast. A fast melt of accumulated snow could harm Michigan waters. The problem: Winter application of manure to farm fields. Rapidly melting snow runs off frozen ground and heads toward lakes and streams. It can carrying with it manure that sat on top of the snow. Snow accumulation in the state has been above average this year, National Weather Service Meteorologist Jared Maples said. Grand Rapids and Muskegon have more than 40 inches above yearly averages, while Lansing has more than 15 inches above the yearly average. The amount of water in the snow varies by location, Maples said, although areas lower in the state might have higher volumes. Currently, Grand Rapids has an estimated 5.6 inches of water in the snow, he said. While Maples said it’s difficult to foresee what kind of melt the state will have, indications are the coming weeks will remain cold. If manure reaches lakes and rivers, bacteria could harm fish and other aquatic creatures, said Karen Tommasulo, a public information officer with the Department of Environmental Quality. Phosphorous in manure causes algal blooms that can rob the water of oxygen. Other nutrients and bacteria could contaminate water and kill fish, Kauffman said. The International Joint Commission recently recommended that winter manure spreading be banned near Lake Erie, which has had issues with algal blooms in recent years. The binational agency advises the U.S. and Canada on issues involving waterways that they share. Spreading manure in the winter is high risk and should be banned, Kauffman said. Farmers are advised to avoid spreading manure in the winter if possible. Not all farmers spread manure in the winter. But they might have to if they lack storage for it or have winter crops, such as winter wheat, which need the nutrients, said Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau. Campbell said phosphorous contamination has many origins and that only one is farming. Those with insufficient storage space are typically smaller farms, Campbell said. Depending on farm size and whether it is an animal feeding operation, the smaller farms might not be required to hold permits for spreading manure, said Nicole Zacharda, enforcement specialist with the Department of Environment Quality Water Resources Division. Those that are required to hold the permits, known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs, are required to have room enough for six months of manure storage. There are almost 250 of those in Michigan. Farmers should distribute manure at least 150 feet from any surface water and avoid putting the manure on fields with slopes, said Shelby Bollwahn, livestock environmental educator with Michigan State University Extension. People can report runoff to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s spill response at 1-800-405-0101 and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality’s Pollution Control hotline at 800-292-4706. Farmers who cause a runoff problem that pollutes the water could be fined between $2,500 and $25,000, Zacharda said. The Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program helps farmers prepare and avoid runoff by teaching best practices and helping determine ideal fields for winter manure application. Program manager Jan Wilford said 600 of Michigan’s about 22,000 livestock farms are in the program and have had no issues polluting Michigan water in 12 years. “I don’t think it’s something to panic about,” Campbell said. “Our farmers are really aware of the water patterns.” Banning the practice would also lead to farmers spreading manure only twice a year, creating a higher risk for large amounts of pollution if runoff occurs at those times, Wilford said. However, some critics of the practice are still concerned. “There is a fundamental problem that we can collect so much liquid waste and then try to spread it on fields,” said Anne Woiwode, state director of the Sierra Club’s Michigan chapter. Woiwode said although some say that banning the practice would hurt small farms and force them out of business, industrial agriculture practices have put small farms in this position. Bollwahn said while warmer weather and potential rain could create higher risk for runoff, the farmers have the tools to deal with potential issues. Besides following best practices, once runoff is identified, Zacharda said farmers can use sand to stop the flow or pumps to remove the manure from water after it has sunk to the bottom.

 Tribune News Services MCT NEWS SERVICE Beaches across the country are being polluted with tainted runoff and sewage at a stubbornly high rate, putting swimmers at risk of getting sick, according to a new report by an environmental group. The Natural Resources Defense Council found the number of beach water samples that failed health tests dipped to 7 percent last year from 8 percent the year before, but said the drop is the result of less rainfall flushing contaminants to the shore, not an overall decline in pollution. Delaware, New Hampshire and North Carolina had the cleanest beaches in 2012, according to the group’s annual Testing the Waters report. The states with the most polluted beaches were Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio. The findings showed little progress for California beaches, which were responsible for 25 percent of the beach closures in the nation. California ranked 20th out of 30 states for beach water quality. The number of beach closings and advisories in California fell slightly in 2012, but not nearly enough to show that beach pollution is improving, said Noah Garrison, staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We want to see that number dropping,” he said. “Unfortunately we still see large numbers of closing and advisory days and we still have persistent pollution problems at our beaches.” The report analyzed bacterial test results and public advisories from more than 3,000 beaches in 30 coastal and Great Lakes states. A high bacteria count indicates the presence of pathogens that can give swimmers skin rashes, eye infections or stomach and respiratory illnesses. Interactive maps in the report allow readers to search by ZIP code with mobile phones to find water quality ratings and swimming advisories for their favorite beach. The report called for stronger beach water quality standards to prevent swimmers from being exposed to contaminated beach water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year approved a new set of beach water quality standards, but environmental groups say they are not stringent enough to protect public health. The Natural Resources Defense Council also recommended adopting faster testing methods. The bacteria-based tests used to monitor beaches across the country can take several days to obtain results and warn swimmers. “You could go swimming Saturday morning at the beach and not know until Monday whether it’s safe to get in the water,” Garrison said. Some areas have experimentedwith beach water tests that provide same-day results, but they are not yet widely used. To clean up beaches in the long term, the council said coastal areas should build rain-absorbing infrastructure to prevent contaminated runoff from reaching the shore or triggering sewage overflows.

(Courtesy Photo) MANISTEE — Manistee City Council could move forward next week in its Wet Weather Corrective Action Program (CAP). In the past 30 years, Manistee has invested nearly $40 million to eliminate raw sewage discharges to the Manistee River. The city closed 18 combined sewer overflows, however, it still faces infiltration and inflow problems. Spicer Group, engineer of record for the City of Manistee, plans to eliminate illegal water in the city’s sewage system. "These bids are part of a two-phase project to meet state mandated requirements to manage inflow and infiltration and eliminate the city's last remaining Sanitary Sewer Overflow (SSO 018). Phase I will reduce inflow and infiltration by structurally lining approximately 5.4 miles of sanitary sewer (Phase I, Contract A), and providing storm water outlets and a storm sewer system to reduce inflow and infiltration (Phase I, Contract B)," said project manager John Bradley, of Spicer Group, in a memo. The city has publicly bid Phase I, Contract A for the Wastewater Collection System Rehabilitation. Five bids were received, with Inland Waters Pollution Control, Inc. submitting the low bid of $2,316,994; the highest bid was submitted by Granite Inliner for $3,526,575. The engineer's estimate is $2,340,000. The Department of Public Works (DPW) and city engineers recommend awarding the contract to the low bidder, Inland Waters Pollution Control, Inc. DPW director Jeff Mikula said in a memo to city manager Thad Taylor, Inland Waters "successfully completed the Pilot Sewer Lining Project in 2018." City council will meet at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in council chambers at City Hall, located at 70 Maple St. in Manistee. Council members also are expected to consider the Phase I, Contract B, Storm and Sanitary Sewer Improvements. Three bids were received, with Gerber Construction submitting the low bid of $1,770,267. The highest bid was submitted by Team Elmer's for $1,999,500. The engineer's estimate is $1,400,000 but did not cover several project items, such as water main replacement. DPW and city engineers recommend awarding the contract to the low bidder, Gerber Construction. Funding for both contracts is derived from the United States Rural Development Phase I Loan previously approved by City Council at $4.4 million. The loan is for 40 years at 2.375 percent interest. "Phase 2 improvements have been submitted to USDA Rural Development for funding review with construction anticipated to start in the spring/summer of 2020 depending on the timing of USDA Rural Development approvals," Bradley said in a memo. "The Phase 2 improvements will improve the conveyance of wastewater to the Wastewater Treatment Plant (Phase 2, Contract A) and will improve wet and dry weather screening, pumping and grit removal at a new headworks structure, provide 6 million gallons of storage for excess inflow and infiltration to be captured and treated by the WWTP to meet State of Michigan requirements, and provide screening, settling, and disinfection of flows exceeding the 6 million galIons of storage capacity (Phase 2, Contract 8)." Other items on Tuesdays agenda are as follows: • Consideration of ordinance 19-24 adding Chapter 1064 — charges for fire runs and emergency services. The department of public safety has requested a new cost recovery ordinance to authorize recovery of certain costs for fire runs and emergency services. An ordinance requires two separate readings. This ordinance was introduced on Dec. 17; it could be adopted during this meeting; • Consideration of scheduling a public hearing for a new Downtown Development Authority development plan for Feb. 4. The current DDA Development Plan and TIF sunsets on March 1. The DDA approved a new Development Plan for consideration, but a public hearing is required before adoption. • Consideration of ordinance 20-1 amending Chapters 866 and 867. "The City of Manistee Medical Marihuana Facilities Ordinance and Recreational Marijuana Ordinance authorize up to 12 grower facilities (medical marihuana) and 12 grower establishments (recreational marihuana). The amendment would make unlimited the number of available grower facility permits under Chapter 866 and grower establishment licenses under Chapter 867; it also would prohibit recreational marijuana establishments not specifically authorized under Chapter 867, including a designated consumption facility. If the ordinance is introduced on Tuesday, it could be adopted at the next regular meeting. • Consideration of zoning ordinance amendment Z19-25: Assembly Operation in Key Street Segment. City Council’s next work session is slated for 7 p.m. on Jan. 14 in council chambers. A discussion will be conducted on Substance Education & Awareness Sea Youth Presentation and the Strategic Plan.

 MNA Staff From the Associated Press DETROIT (AP) — Michigan's U.S. senators are seeking more federal funding to continue a wide-ranging Great Lakes cleanup program. Democrats Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters announced bipartisan legislation to renew and expand the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative at a series of news conferences Thursday and Friday. The bill would continue the program through 2026 and gradually increase its annual appropriation from the current $300 million to $475 million. The program focuses on some of the Great Lakes' most longstanding environmental problems, including industrial toxic pollution, invasive species, runoff that causes algae blooms and wildlife habitat loss. In Michigan, it has provided a combined $762 million for 880 projects, including restoring native fish populations in the Detroit River and removing 200 tons (181 metric tons) of marine debris from Belle Isle in Detroit.

 Tribune News Services The following editorial was published in the Los Angeles Times: (TNS) Will California show the nation how to take on the enormous problem of single-use plastic? Or will state lawmakers chicken out under heavy lobbying by plastic makers who are happy to continue to cover the world in discarded water bottles, used food wrappers and countless other pieces of disposable packaging? We will find out soon. It’s not an overstatement to say that the fate of one of the world’s biggest sources of pollution hangs on the passage of the California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act, by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) and Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica). This legislation — which will be passed or die on Friday, the last day for the Legislature to pass new bills this year — would fundamentally reshape the product packaging industry by requiring products sold in the state to be wrapped in material that is being recycled or composted at a 75% rate by 2030. This is important because even though most plastic is theoretically recyclable, very little of it actually gets recycled. Only about 6% of the some 83 billion metric tons of plastic ever produced has been recycled. The rest can be found somewhere in our environment, possibly as tiny particles in the ocean or the food you’re eating. And that gap is likely to grow. Even while plastic production has increased, the global demand for used plastic bottles and bags to turn into something else has all but dried up. If the bill becomes law, manufacturers over the next decade will have to build recycling plants for their plastic detergent containers and potato chip bags (creating manufacturing jobs! President Trump’s gonna love this law), or repackage them in a material that is compostable or already recycled at a high rate, such as glass. And if California — which has the fifth-largest economy on the planet — demands sustainable packaging, the world’s manufacturers will listen. What’s remarkable is how many organizations that stand to be affected have dropped their initial opposition, including the California Retailers Association, the American Beverage Association and the American Chemistry Council. The state’s grocers have gone one step further and now support the bill, which is really astonishing considering that grocery stores would see many of the products on their shelves reconfigured under this bill. Those businesses deserve a lot of credit for not standing in the way of a law that, while good for the planet, would force a big change to their operations. Now it’s time for legislators and the governor to show their support. They have an important choice to make: They can show the world how to tackle the scourge of plastic trash. Or they can demonstrate how fear of political fallout is the biggest obstacle to our environmental challenges. No pressure.

 Monday, March 23, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan Breaking News: BREAKING: Gov. Whitmer signs ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order By Brandon Schreur | on October 22, 2019 Belding Mayor Brad Miller reads through two proposed ordinances regarding air pollution and trichloroisocyanuric acid during last Tuesday’s Belding City Council meeting. The ordinances will be voted on by the City Council during the Oct. 29 meeting at 7 p.m. in the Pere Marquette Depot. — DN Photo | Brandon Schreur BELDING — The city of Belding is in the process of creating new laws to prevent air pollution following this past summer’s trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA) incidents at a local factory. On June 22, a fire involving TCICA at Kassouni Manufacturing Inc. (KMI) produced a chlorine cloud over Belding. Three days later, a second TCICA fire broke out at the property. In the weeks that followed, many residents expressed their concerns and frustration over a lack of communication on the topic from the city. While an Ionia County judge signed an order in August that allows the Belding chlorine manufacturer to continue conducting business that does not involve the use of TCICA, city officials are now taking preventative measures to ensure similar situations don’t arise. During Tuesday’s meeting, the Belding City Council unveiled the first reading of two ordinances that enforce restrictions involving chemicals related to manufacturing. “We aren’t voting on any of these tonight,” Mayor Brad Miller told the council. “This is the first reading, meaning that we’ll vote on them during the next meeting.” If approved, Ordinance No. 552 will amend a previous zoning ordinance in Belding by providing greater distances between public areas and manufacturing areas that “utilize, produce or have the potential to produce a corrosive acid or alkali, cement, lime, gypsum or plaster of paris.” “Access driveways shall be located no less than 100 feet from the centerline of the intersection of any street or any other driveway,” the proposed ordinance reads. “The principal and accessory buildings and structures shall not be located within one thousand feet of any residential use or district.” City Manager John Niemela explained this ordinance would give the city greater control over the chemicals that are being used in Belding. Grand Rapids Roofers work on fixing the roof at Kassouni Manufacturing Inc. The Belding chlorine manufacturing company experienced a series of TCICA fires over the past summer. — Submitted photo “We looked at our ordinance in relation to manufacturing facilities, and one of the areas we felt we needed to strengthen is in the area of activities that are permitted under special land use for zoning and manufacturing, and the use of certain chemicals and products,” he said. “…This puts us in a better position of being able to control what products are being used or manufactured in those facilities.” Ordinance No. 553 addressed the problem of TCICA in relation to special air pollution control standards. “There have been at least seven prior instances during which the hazardous chemical compound known as (TCICA) has been handled in a dangerous, negligent and otherwise unlawful manner on lands in the I-1 District, resulting in either smoldering chemical reactions or fires, and consequent releases of dangerous and/or toxic gases to the atmosphere,” the proposed ordinance explains. “These incidents have required that the city repeatedly deploy emergency service personnel to the site of the releases, at significant cost to the city and its taxpayers. These incidents have resulted in the insurance of ‘shelter in place’ orders of nearby residents, and nearby residents have reported adverse health effects resulting from the exposure to released hazardous gases, including burning skin and respiratory irritation.” The document goes on to say that, given the dangerous properties of TCICA and the risk it puts residents in, the use of the chemical within a specific area will require approval from the City Council. A new thermoplastic polyolefin new roof at Kassouni is said to last the chlorine manufacturing company “for years to come.” — Submitted photo “No person may engage in a manufacturing process on lands zoned in the I-1 District that involves TCICA if the manufacturing process would occur in a facility that is located a distance less than 1,320 feet (1/4-mile) from any residential property line or residential zoning district boundary line, unless prior approval has been obtained from the City Council,” the ordinance reads. The person seeking the council’s approval must prove that the total amount of TCICA they wish to use will not create a chlorine gas concentration at the nearest residential property or zoning district boundary line. A violation of ordinance 553 is considered to be a public nuisance and a misdemeanor that’s subject to penalty for each violation. “In addition to any remedies provided by this section or otherwise available to the city at law, the city may bring an action for an injunction or initiate other available processes against a person to restrain, prevent or abate any violation of this article,” the proposed ordinance reads. Niemela emphasized that the city wrote this ordinance to better control the use of potentially harmful chemicals. “We didn’t really have a strong ordinance on air pollution standards,” he told the council. “This ordinance, if approved, would give us strength in being able to regulate certain products in terms of discharge into the open air. It’s regulatory power and control as to what could be released and, if it is, how we can treat those violations.” The City Council will vote on the ordinances during the Oct. 29 meeting at 7 p.m. in the Pere Marquette Depot. Since the incidents over the summer, KMI hired Grand Rapids Roofers for maintenance repair to the building. “110 square tear off, replacing deck and new 60 mil (thermoplastic polyolefin roofing),” Grand Rapids Roofers posted to the Greenville Matters Facebook page. “Was a pleasure dealing with the wonderful owners of KMI and looking to redo their building after purchasing it. With a new roof that will last them for years to come and a long warranty from (Grand Rapids Roofers) with double rain protection.” You must be logged in to post a comment. Our Hometown

 Monday, March 23, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan Breaking News: BREAKING: Gov. Whitmer signs ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order By Cory Smith | on July 27, 2019 GREENVILLE — A local manufacturer is facing penalties for violating state and federal air quality standards as a result of equipment installed in 2017. Dicastal North America, located at 1 Dicastal Drive in Greenville, is facing $226,170 in penalties to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy for alleged air pollution violations of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act. — DN Photo | Cory Smith The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) Air Quality Division (AQD), is seeking resolution from Dicastal North America, Inc., located at 1 Dicastal Drive in the city’s industrial park, for alleged air pollution violations of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act. According to the AQD, specifically, Dicastal exceeded matter emission limits in regards to: particulate matter (PM); particulate matter less than 10 microns (PM10); and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), PM consists of a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. PM10 consists of inhalable particles with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller while PM2.5 consists of “fine inhalable” particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller. According to the EPA, PM particles “are so small that they can be inhaled and cause serious health problems.” Some particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter can get deep into one’s lungs and some may even get into the bloodstream. Of these, particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter pose the greatest risk to health. Fine particles are also the main cause of reduced visibility (haze) in parts of the United States, including national parks and wilderness areas. According to the summary report released by EGLE, Dicastal also failed to maintain a minimum thermal oxidizer volatile organic compound (VOC) destruction efficiency of 95% and a three-hour block average temperature above 725 degrees celsius — and failed to conduct an annual capture and collection system inspection as required by the Code of Federal Regulations. Dicastal was initially issued a Permit to Install (PTI) a new thermal aluminum chip dryer (EU-ChipDryer) on January 13, 2017. Compliance testing was performed on May 8-10 of 2018 and the test results documented the exceedance of the PM, PM10 and PM2.5 emission limits. The test results also documented a VOC destruction efficiency that was below the permit limit of 95%. Additionally, record-keeping violations were discovered during an inspection conducted on April 4, 2018. On 16 occasions, facility records documented that the three-hour block average temperature of the afterburner controlling emissions from the EU-ChipDryer was below the minimum required temperature of 725 degrees Celsius. Also, the company failed to conduct an annual inspection of the capture and collection system of the EU-ChipDryer, as required by the Code of Federal Regulations. In August of 2018, Dicastal Engineering Manager Michael James informed the EGLE in a letter it was aware of the exceeded levels. “Although particulate emissions from the thermal chip dryer have exceeded permit limits, emissions from the facility remain less than the Title V major source thresholds of 100 tons per year,” he wrote. According to James, tests performed by Fishbeck, Thompson, Carr & Huber Inc. on PM10 and PM2.5 emissions indicated ambient impacts for the facility would continue to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Unable to find a solution to lower the levels to meet the requirements of the PTI, Dicastal proposed installing a baghouse on the thermal chip dryer to correct the violation. In regards to the VOC efficiency and temperature drop, Dicastal planned to remove the thermal oxidizer as part of the work associated with installing the new baghouse, which it believes will fix both issues. In regards to failing to conduct annual inspections, James attributed that to a turnover in staff. “Contracting the capture and collection system annual inspection was assigned to a process engineer who has since departed Dicastal,” James wrote. “In addition, the facility has had some difficulty in finding a contractor in the area to perform the annual inspection. Dicastal is working to find a contractor and plan on having the inspection completed b7 Oct. 31, 2018. As the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (Now EGLE) is aware, Dicastal is a new facility and proper operation and maintenance of the thermal chip dryer has taken more time than anticipated. Dicastal is committed to working with (EGLE) to bring the thermal chip dryer back into compliance.” As a result of these violations, the EGLE issued a consent order, which Dicastal is expected to comply with. Dicastal North America Inc. did not respond to a request for comment for this story to verify the consent order will be complied with. Under the agreed-upon terms of the proposed consent order, the company has agreed to comply with the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations, including performing emission testing to confirm compliance with the emission limits established in the PTI for the baghouse of the EU-ChipDryer. The proposed Consent Order incorporates a monetary settlement amount of $226,170 to the state of Michigan general fund, and according to Jeff Rathbun of the AQD, failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the consent order could result in a maximum stipulated penalty of $7,500.00 per violation per day. “AQD staff believes that the proposed consent order, as drafted, contains an appropriate compliance program for resolution of the federal and state air quality violations against the company,” Rathbun said in the conclusion of his report. “The AQD staff recommends that the proposed consent order be entered, unless substantive adverse comments are received during the public comment period.” The EGLE accepted comments from the public from June 24 to July 24 and will make a determination of whether a public hearing is necessary depending on the comments received.

 Monday, March 23, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan Breaking News: BREAKING: Gov. Whitmer signs ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order By The Daily News Staff | on April 27, 2019 “If we had no Winter, the Spring would not be so pleasant.” — Anne Bradstreet, Early English Poet of North America (1612-1672) BACKGROUND This Spring my Columns will be featuring answers to questions on Gardening topics that are of interest to local gardeners. One popular topic we will begin with is “What is a Rain Garden?” DEFINITION Professor Leonard Perry, University of Vermont Extension explains, “Rain Gardens are actually slightly sunken gardens, usually with native plants, whose purpose is to collect rain run-off.” The run-off will soak into the rain garden soil instead of draining off your property carrying along with it contaminants that will pollute our local waterways. NEED Most of the above ground waterways in our area are polluted. These waterways include streams, creeks, ponds, rivers and lakes in our community. Almost three-quarters of this pollution comes from stormwater. About half of this stormwater drains off of our garden landscapes and building roofs. This pollution consists of pesticides and other chemicals, oil, gas and many other everyday contaminants, which are toxic to our environment. A rain garden on your property as part of your landscape gardens is a great way to help reduce this pollution BASICS A tried and true way to determine the best location for your rain garden is for you to go outdoors during a heavy rain — dress appropriately, of course — and see first hand how the rainwater flows on your property, where it collects and where it exits your property to drains, sewers, streams, etc. From your observations, you will be able to tell where to place your rain garden. It will most likely be in in a low area where the rainwater already collects allowing it to seep into the garden soil rather than running off of your property. As a general rule, rain gardens are usually shallow, around six inches deep in most cases. This will allow the water tolerant plants in the garden to survive periods of heavy rain. The rain garden bed should be flat to allow any stormwater to seep into the rain garden soil uniformly. Ideally, your rain garden should be near drain spouts but not too close to your home or garage, which would allow water to seep into basement areas. Other areas of concerns include avoiding underground utilities when digging and staying clear of any trees to prevent damaging their roots. Your rain garden doesn’t have to have a large surface area to be effective. You will know if your rain garden is doing its job if the stormwater drains within 12 hours or up to one day, at the longest. SOIL TYPE The most important feature of a rain garden is to allow water that it captures to slowly seep into its soil. In the garden, soil types are based upon soil texture, which is quite simply the way the soil feels in your hands. The soil texture is the result of the various soil particles found. The water holding capacity of the soil, its rate of drainage, and its ability to hold nutrients, are all directly related to its texture. Clay soil is made up of small particles and feels sticky, sandy soil is made up of larger particles and feels gritty and loam soils are a mixture of different size soil particles. For your rain garden, loam soils are ideal. Fortunately, for most area gardeners the Montcalm County website (www.montcalm.org) indicates that approximately 75% off the soil in Montcalm County consists of sandy loam. You don’t want clay soil in your rain garden, which will not allow the water to readily seep through. It is better to have loam soil even if you have to replace the existing soil. If needed, the replacement soil should be about 2 feet deep. A smart way to find out the makeup of your garden soil is to run samples with the MSU Extension Soil Test Kit that you can obtain online from the MSUE Bookstore, www.bookstore.msue.msu.edu NATIVE PLANTS We have discussed the value of Michigan native plants in several of our Gardening for the Novice Columns and have reviewed Michigan native plants in detail in the May 2018 Column. Michigan native plants should be the principal plants in the rain garden you build. They are well adapted to our area’s soil, climate and wildlife and can be used to create a beautiful and very effective, native rain garden. The native plants’ large root systems will allow the rainwater to penetrate the rain garden soil and minimize any runoff. For a comprehensive listing of West Michigan native plants for use in your rain gardens, search West Michigan Rain Gardens online. Native trees, shrubs, grasses and wildflowers favoring wet to moist, as well as moist to dry conditions, are all included in this comprehensive listing. Some native plants we had had success growing locally include coral bells, purple coneflower, black-eyed Susan, switchgrass and juneberry trees. MAINTENANCE Many people are under the impression that rain gardens are maintenance free — they are not. As with other native landscape gardens, they require clean up, weeding and mulching, on a regular basis. Pesticides, fungicides and herbicides should not be used around or near your rain gardens to minimize contamination problems. MORE INFO We have tried to cover the basics of rain gardens. Much more information can be found on the web. A US Dept. of Agriculture Bulletin on Rain Gardens goes over it in more detail — benefits, design, building and maintaining the garden.

 Monday, March 23, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan Breaking News: BREAKING: Gov. Whitmer signs ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order By Meghan Nelson | on September 20, 2018 ORLEANS TOWNSHIP — The Michigan Department of Health & Human Services (MDHHS) offered Orleans Township residents a chemistry lesson Tuesday night on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS, to help them understand the contamination found within their community. Bill Ferrell, a toxicologist with the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services response section, gave Orleans Township residents a chemistry lesson on what PFAS is and how levels are calculated during Tuesday’s Orleans Township Board meeting. — DN Photo | Meghan Nelson MDHHS officials, along with the Ionia County Health Department and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) attended the Orleans Township Board meeting to update and reassure residents about PFAS test results within the community. Ionia County Health Officer and Director of Environmental Health Ken Bowen explained there are 3,000 different PFAS compounds, all of which are man-made and don’t occur naturally in the environment. However, they are ubiquitous and found in household items, such as cookware, technology, apparel and any item meant to resist heat, oils, grease, stains or water. Their widespread use along with pollution have introduced them into the environment where they don’t degrade. Bill Ferrell, a toxicologist with the MHDDS response section, explained the compound resiliency is due to its atomic makeup. “This carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest bonds, and it gives these chemicals unique characteristics,” Ferrell said. “They are very stable in the environment, and they don’t break down easily. They’re very mobile in the environment, especially in groundwater, and they bioaccumulate in biota, including humans.” Perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), which was found at 200 ppt at EightCAP’s facility, has four carbon-fluorine bonds, while other PFAS compounds, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), have eight of those carbon-fluorine bonds. PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have been recorded in human epidemiological and then tested in animal studies to come up with a reference dose or the acceptable level of daily ingestion for those compounds. According to Ferrell, researchers determined the reference dose for PFOS and PFOA to be 20 nanograms per kilogram per day. That reference dose is used to determine the lifetime health advisory for drinking water by assuming how much water the average person drinks and how much of the compound the daily water intake can safely contain. “If you think back to your old algebra, you know or make assumptions of how much water the person is ingesting and you know what the daily intake is. You rearrange it and solve for the drinking water concentration,” Ferrell said. “That’s how they came up with the 70 ppt as the acceptable lifetime health advisory.” The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not currently have a lifetime health advisory for PFBS, but it does have a reference dose of 20,000 nanograms per kilogram per day — a thousand times higher than the combined reference dose for PFOA and PFOS. Ferrell said PFBS’s higher reference dose, which means a lower toxicity level, may be attributed to the small chain size and low half-life (the rate at which a chemical decrease by half) of PFBS in blood. PFBS has a half-life of 28 days compared to 2.1 to 10.1 years for PFOA and 2.1 to 27 years for PFOS. “Based on this information, given the low half-life of PFBS relative to PFOS and PFOA as well as the relative toxicity as exhibited by the reference doses, the DHHS has concluded the concentration of PFBS of 200 ppt does not pose a public health risk,” Ferrell said. Although health officials said local water is most likely safe to consume, they are still looking for the source of the PFBS contamination. Aaron Assmann, an environmental quality analyst with the MDEQ, explained he uses several tools such as Environmental Mapper, which is available to the public at www.mcgi.state.mi.us/environmentalmapper, to look for potential sources of contamination. “When we get new info like this, we typically do a table-top review,” he explained. “We look at our databases. We look for industrial operations in the area. We look for possible confirmed releases whether they’re gasoline releases or other compounds we consider to be hazardous materials.” Looking for any link to a PFAS leak, Assmann said he couldn’t find one. He found underground gasoline storage tanks, including two which is registered as leaking and removed. Gasoline isn’t linked to PFAS plumes, and the confirmed release was closed in 1995. “There were a few complaints, but none of them really stood out to me,” Assmann said. “There’s not really a solid silver bullet PFAS source I found near that site.” Assmann and Abigail Hendershott, the district supervisor for the MDEQ’s remediation and redevelopment division, admitted they’re working from Grand Rapids and don’t know Orleans Township, as well as residents, do. “If you do know of information we should know, please, let us know,” Hendershott said. Several residents mentioned nearby Pitsch Landfill, which they said has had problems in the past. According to Hendershott, active landfills are up next for PFAS testing and she added she will work with her waste management division colleagues at the MDEQ to learn more about Pitsch Landfill. In the meantime, although the PFBS contamination is believed to be safe for residents to drink, health officials recognize it may still worry residents and gave options to abate their fears. Hendershott said she personally feels comfortable installing a National Science Foundation certified three-stage carbon filter under her kitchen sink to remove any potential PFOA or PFOS contamination and are likely to remove other PFAS compounds. Bowen said if he was an Orleans Township resident, he would look into testing his water, which can cost between $250 and $500. But he acknowledged it’s an individual choice. “The million dollar question everyone wants to ask is if it’s safe,” Bowen said. “You’re going to find when you ask a health official if something is safe they get pretty squirrelly. We don’t like to say things are safe because we say it is safe and then something changes tomorrow. “I’m being told by MHHDS this chemical at this level is not a health concern,” he added. “That being said, I’ll also tell you from a health perspective, it should not be in the water, which is why we’re going to continue to investigate it.” Hendershott reassured residents the MDEQ isn’t done with Orleans Township. As the MDEQ continues to receive more information over the next year, she said they will continue to update residents. You must be logged in to post a comment. Our Hometown

url: https://thedailynews.cc/articles/home-key-tips-to-successfully-garden-in-the-montcalm-county-area/
 Monday, March 23, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan Breaking News: BREAKING: Gov. Whitmer signs ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order By The Daily News Staff | on October 30, 2017 “I think this is what hooks one to gardening: it is the closest one can come to being present at creation” — Phyllis Theroux, American journalist (1939-present) Landscape gardens this year in Montcalm County have been subjected to an usually wide range of severe environmental conditions — heat, rain and drought, just to name a few. To be successful, area gardeners have had to adjust to these conditions to keep their gardens productive. I have compiled this list of key tips to help our novice gardeners continue to have successful gardening experiences in future years. • Keep your Landscape Area Sanitized Keep your garden and surroundings clean and free of trash and assorted debris that always seems to accumulate during the growing season. This will improve the landscape appearance and just as importantly, eliminate places where pests and diseases can survive over the winter. • Maintain Healthy Soil Testing the landscape garden soil takes the guesswork out of maintaining the landscape garden in optimum condition for plant growth. Very simply, various plants have different nutrient and acidity (PH) requirements. To better understand what is needed, a soil test will inform you which nutrients need to be added by fertilizer to the soil to optimize the growth of the various plants in your gardens. By not adding unnecessary chemicals to your garden, you will reduce the amount of pollution in the air you breathe. MSU Extension provides an easy to use soil test self-mailers, which can be purchased at www.msusoiltest.com. The neat thing about this soil test is MSU Extension will give you recommendations for your landscape gardens if you supply them with specifics on the kind of garden you are having tested. The results will determine your soil texture, pH and provide you with nutrient levels in your soil. Also recommendations for lime and nitrogen you may need to add to your soil (if necessary). • Watering Correctly Novice gardeners usually water too much or too little with disappointment as a result. To do a good job with your garden, you need to spend enough time to find out what each of your plant groupings requirements is. As a general rule — although there are some exceptions — a total of an inch of water per week between rain and irrigation should be sufficient for your landscape garden needs. This includes trees and shrubs as well as grass plantings. Watering should be done in several sessions over the course of a week and will result in more robust plant root systems which in turn will lead to healthier plants. Watering lightly, even more frequently, will lead to shallower roots with the resulting plants more prone to drought and disease problems. Soaker systems are more effective than oscillating lawn sprinklers for watering plants. Using a ground drip soaker will minimize water loss through evaporation and reduce the risk of water soaked leaves which will eventually lead to plant disease. • Pick the Right Plants to Grow Picking the right plants to grow in your landscape gardens is not an easy task. It is easy to be overwhelmed with all the choices you have. An excellent choice for the novice gardener is sticking with native plants. Plants that naturally grow in our area and are selected to match the light and soil conditions on your property, will be the most desirable choices. These plants will require less water and have less need for fertilizers and pesticides to remain healthy. Presently, there are many choices in native plants with varying heights and shapes that are well adapted to our area conditions. For example, MSU has an excellent website reviewing all types of native plants that can be grown in our area, as well as other areas in the rest of Michigan at www.nativeplants.msu.edu. Natives I have had success with in Montcalm include: coral bells, purple coneflower, columbine, bee balm, black-eyed susan, switchgrass and juneberry trees. • Don’t Forget to Mulch Mulching is a real necessity for your garden. It acts as an insulator for the soil, keeping it cooler in summer and warmer in winter. Mulch significantly reduces weed growth, retains moisture and minimizes soil erosion. It especially helps in Michigan spring weather by preventing frost damage. Mulched plants will stay put in alternating freezing and thawing weather and will not appear early in brief spring warming periods. In general, mulch is usually used year round for trees, shrubs and perennials while annuals and vegetables are covered with mulch in the spring. There are many choices for mulch organic materials. Wood chips, shredded bark and straw tend to be the most popular. • Have a Bug Free Garden Mentality Most novice gardeners are upset when they see any signs of bugs in their landscape gardens and will usually try to destroy them by any means possible. In actuality, a garden in healthy balance will always have good bugs and bad bugs present. In fact, most of the good bugs in your garden beds keep the bad bugs at bay. They also help pollinate, which is a necessity for most plants and vegetables. Very few caterpillars, beetles, spiders or worms, for example, are really bad so don’t try to destroy them all. If in doubt use extension sites to research the bugs you encounter to determine whether they are beneficial to your garden. • Keeping Good Records As a final, but perhaps the most important tip is to review your past years gardening experience, both good and bad. To do this, I recommend keeping a garden journal — an inexpensive school notebook will work fine — so you have it as a handy reference. Problems you experience during the year, which plants you grew and where you placed them in your landscape gardens, what you liked and what you didn’t, are all things to consider for your journal. Also important is to list any changes you would like to make for the new growing season. Gardening is a wonderful hobby that almost everyone can enjoy at many different levels. By following the key tips described above, you will be able to manage most of the common issues you will confront. You must be logged in to post a comment. Our Hometown

 Breaking News: ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order to go into effect By Staff | on July 27, 2017 The Central Michigan District Health Department (CMDHD) is conducting a bathing beach monitor­ing program of public beaches in the six county district which includes Roscommon County, as well as the counties of Arenac, Clare, Gladwin, Isabella and Osceola. According to a press release from the CMDHD’s Environmental Health Services Division, for more than 16 years, the CMDHD has conducted a bathing beach monitor­ing program of public beaches in the six-county district. (This year it is also partnering with the Midland County Health Department to assist in monitoring select beaches in Mid­land County.) “Although funding continues to be limited, CMDHD will be able to monitor the most heavily used beaches and the beaches most vul­nerable to contamination in our ser­vice area. Beaches that are open to the public but not part of our moni­toring program, including smaller beaches, campgrounds, and chil­dren’s camps, have been asked by the health department to either im­plement a water sampling program that meets the state standards or post notices at the beaches to inform the public whether or not the water has been tested for E. coli bacteria,” CMDHD Director of Environmental Health Services Steve King said. “If you don’t see a posting at a public beach advising whether the beach is monitored and how to find the results of testing, you should con­tact the beach manager or local mu­nicipality responsible for the beach to request they post the beach,” King said. Surface waters contaminated with elevated levels of E. coli bacteria can result in flu-like symptoms includ­ing nausea, vomiting, stomachache, diarrhea, headache and fever. Other minor illnesses associated with swimming in contaminated wa­ters include ear, eye, nose and throat infections and skin rashes. In highly polluted waters, swimmers run the risk of exposure to more serious disease causing organisms such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, E. coli O157, Norovirus and Shigella. “By monitoring our public swim­ming areas throughout the sum­mer season, we can promote public safety by warning of high levels of harmful bacteria,” King said. In order to close or post an advi­sory for a beach, the data results for E.coli contamination must exceed 300 E.coli/100 mLs of water for one single sampling event. The closure or advisory is lifted after the results from sampling indicated levels of E.coli have fallen below the contam­ination level. When it comes to making a per­sonal decision as to which beaches to spend summer days on, keep in mind the following tips: • Large amounts of waterfowl present (geese or ducks) could mean an increased amount of “bird drop­pings” which may contain high con­centrations of E. coli bacteria (there may also be a higher risk of swim­mer’s itch). • A person should not swim in public beaches if he or she has open sores or lesions on his or her body. • Research the number of closings the beach has had in the most recent years by visiting www.cmdhd.org, Public Beach Monitoring. • If there has been a heavy rain event within the past 48 hours, use caution in swimming due to possible runoff and higher levels of bacteria in the water. • If the water is discolored with a greenish, blue or milky appearance, this may indicate an algae bloom. Certain algae blooms can produce toxins that could make someone ill. • Public beaches that are used by a large number of people, especially small children, could contain body fluids and fecal matter. • Do not swim where the beach has an overabundance of trash and litter. • Dry off immediately with a clean towel after getting out of the water. Remember to use sunscreen and take precautions against sun­burn. It is also a good idea to take a shower after spending a day at the beach. • Wash your hands with soap and water before eating. For information on the beach monitoring program and results, log onto www.cmdhd.org and click on the Public Beach Monitoring infor­mation link. This program is made available through funds from the Department of Environmental Quality, the Clean Michigan Initiative, Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the Sagi­naw Chippewa Indian Tribe.

 Breaking News: ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order to go into effect By Staff | on June 15, 2017 1.7-OUNCE MONSTER Five-year-old Stevie Bednarik looks on as St. Helen Lake Association President John Bawol weighs the 1.7-ounce bluegill she caught at Lake St. Helen during Free Fishing Weekend. Her father, Steve Bednarik, took Stevie and his son, Degen (left), to have their catches weighed at the weigh-in station at the Richfield Township Lake St. Helen Access Park as part of Roscommon County’s Michigan’s Other Great Lakes Family Fishing Fest June 10. Degen caught a 10.2 ounce sunfish. FISHING WITH FAMILY David Nieman gives his son, Xavier, some words of encouragement June 10 as the two fished at the Houghton Lake South Shore Department of Natural Resources Boat Launch at part of Free Fishing Weekend. “He out fishes me sometimes, don’t you buddy,” Nieman said of his son. FISHING IN THE PARK Three-year-old Carter Cunning­ham, the son of Ron and Michele Cunningham of Millington, sang a fishing song he made up while fishing for plastic fish at Lyon Township’s Park 27 June 10. The Friends of Lyon Township hosted vendors, a bake sale, games and fishing related events at Park 27 as part of Michigan’s Other Great Lakes Family Fishing Fest during the Department of Natural Resources’ Free Fishing Weekend. HOUGHTON LAKE BASS Paul Spindler of Zeeland shows off the 3.21-pound, 17 1/2-inch largemouth bass he caught June 10. Spindler had the fish weighed at the Houghton Lake South Shore Department of Natural Resources Boat Launch as part of Michigan’s Other Great Lakes Family Fishing Fest in conjunction with the DNR’s Free Fish­ing Weekend. GOING FISHING Matthew Rogers shows off his fishing hat while playing at Lyon Township’s Park 27 June 10. His mother, Missy Rogers, of Newaygo, said that her son caught a five- inch, three-ounce bass earlier in the day. “When I said we were going [fishing], he wanted to catch the smallest fish and I think he did,” Missy said. She added the bass was caught at Marl Lake. WINNER (Left) Cameron Baker, the son of Amber McMillen of Houghton Lake, picks out rubber worms as his casting contest prize during Michigan’s Other Great Lakes Family Fishing Fest June 10 at the Richfield Township Lake St. Helen Access Park. Kathy Jernigan (left) said the prizes for the day were donated by the St. Helen Lake Association, snacks were provided by Jan Waltz and water was donated by Mercantile Bank. PEACEFUL MORNING FISHING Randy Franks casts his line the morning of June 10 at the shore of the Richfield Township Lake St. Helen Access Park. CLEAN WATER ALL AROUND As residents of Michigan, Educator and Naturalist Tom Dale told students at Lake Saver Day June 9 that people are accustomed to having an abundance of clean, cold and safe water surrounding them and it has become “our way of life” to have access to fresh water. For people around the world, Dale said access to fresh water is not always the case. He told them how President Jimmy Carter had helped to erradicate the spread of Guinea worm, which Dale said people ingest by drinking unclean water. He said Carter promoted the use of drinking water through a screen to help people around the world from ingesting the Guinea worm.

During a pollutant demonstration, Little used a bowl to repre­sent a body of water. She then described types of water pollutants and then asked the students to pour those pollutants into the bowl. One of the pollutants she discussed was oil, which the students used maple syrup to represent oil being dumped in a body of water. Lake Saver Day is designed to teach fourth graders about the importance of water conservation and preservation through teaching methods of lake stewardship. The students also toured a boat wash, learned about water safety from the Roscommon County Sheriff’s Office Marine Patrol, learned about erosion, what a watershed is and were given a police water equipment demon­stration by the Gerrish Township Police Department.

Meeks told the students to use the skills they were taught and not be fooled by the clues they were given when finding their next course check point as it was a bit tricky. Meeks said that learning to use a compass is a valuable skill to teach children as it is a reliable tool. He said GPS and cell phones aren’t always reliable in the woods and having the skills to use a compass can come in handy. “This always works,” Meeks said of a compass.

 Breaking News: ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order to go into effect By Staff | on March 30, 2017 President Obama had increased funds to the Great Lakes by over $300 million while Mitt Romney said absolutely nothing in support of the Great Lakes, not only in Asian Carp issues but also in environmental and pollution problems. Donald Trump proposed to cut 97% of funding from the Great Lakes project so Moolenaar is going to kindly ask President Trump to walk his proposal back while criticizing our past president. Trump’s plan would have only given $10 million in funds. Why wasn’t Moolenaar just as critical of his? My, my, it’s all President Obama’s fault in healthcare and on the Asian Carp problems. Oh no, not Republicans. Well let me fully explain facts to Rep. Moolenaar. Asian Carp have been an issue for over 40 years. Asian Carp were brought here in the 1970s and have since traveled up the Mississippi River north from southern state districts. Illinois Department of Natural Resources had taken as many as 80,000 to 100,000 pounds in a given week through all kinds of methods. So must I remind Moolenaar that Chicago is in Illinois, where his sarcasm was directed. President Obama, Republicans and 80% of Ohio Democrats agreed on the importance of restoring the Great Lakes. They were not contained in the south. Now they run rampant to the north, northeast through Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, even Canada, leading right into our rivers. Must I also remind Moolenaar of the Republican Great Recession that ruined our economy which curtailed and crippled many of the proposals President Obama would loved to have completed. President Trump never faced that reality but still recommended cuts to the Great Lakes region. May I also remind Moolenaar that President Obama was not born when our industrial companies polluted our rivers, our Great Lakes and still coal companies were polluting rivers from overflowed coal ash ponds. Those southern states did nothing to stop those events from happening until they were stopped by the EPA, forcing one company to close through lawsuits. Rep. Moolenaar should have been more responsive to the Flint Water Crisis that is still ongoing. President Obama did not run Michigan, but Governor Rick Snyder, City Manager of Flint and Republican representatives did. I guess that President Trump feels the border wall is more important to him rather than the Great Lakes region or even Meals on Wheels. Rep. Moolenaar needs to go beyond just his critical views. Get on with work in all aspects of Michigan issues. President Obama is gone now, you’re still here. David S. Walenski St. Helen Your email address will not be published.

(Courtesy photo)Over the course of Lake Saver Day, which was held June 3 at the Ralph A. MacMullan Conference Center, Bolz­man told the current fourth graders that he participated in the first Lake Saver Day in 2008. As a senior Bolzman said he remembers going to Lake Saver Day and the presentation that stuck with him the most was “the bowl.” THE FIRST LAKE SAVER DAY RJ Bolzman and the rest of Mrs. Mary Jo Mayes 2008 fourth grade class are pictured at the first Lake Saver Day with Sgt. Greg Patchin of the Gerrish Township Police Department. Bolzman is in the back row, second to the right of Patchin. (Courtesy photo) During that particular presentation, a large bowl was used to represent Higgins Lake. The bowl was then polluted with items that were meant to represent oil, trash, chemicals and dirt. Once the bowl had all the items in it, the bowl’s water was filled with pollutants. That presentation Bolzman said has stuck with him for the last nine years. “Being at the first one (Lake Saver Day) built on my passion for environ­mental studies,” Bolzman said. He said that he hopes when fourth graders come to Lake Saver Day that they too take on the same passion for keeping bodies of water clean. “I think other schools should do this,” Bolzman added. Bolzman, who graduated from Gray­ling High School on June 5 plans to at­tend Kirtland Community College to ob­tain an associate degree in business, then transfer to Western Michigan University to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in freshwater sciences and sustainability. Although he is undecided on his final ca­reer, Bolzman said it will be in the field of water sciences. He is currently working on obtaining his divemaster certificate and is already a master diver. This summer Bolzman will be working with the HLF obtain­ing water samples and spending time on the foundation’s Diver Assisted Suc­tion Harvester (DASH) boat. He will be diving to harvest Eurasian watermilfoil from Higgins Lake in an effort to remove the invasive species from the lake. While speaking to the students, Bol­zman told them that his “passion” for Higgins Lake and water sustainability started at Lake Saver Day. He encour­aged the students to listen to the presen­tations as they too may find their love for water sciences could start at Lake Saver Day. Bolzman’s mother, Ann, who is the HLF’s administrative assistant, is not surprised that her son is going to study water sciences. Growing up, Ann said that Higgins Lake was always special for her and she wanted him to have the same passion for the lake as she does. “He was baptized in Higgins Lake,” Ann said. She “insisted” he be baptized there and noted that action shows the im­portance of the lake to her family. She added that she is “really excited” to see her son go into water sciences be­cause she sees the importance of having those who care for the future of bodies of water. “…I am so proud of RJ. I was hoping he would go in this direction as the lake and our natural resources are something I brought him up to respect. I started teaching him at a young age how impor­tant these resources are and, any time we went out on Higgins Lake, we always kept an eye out for garbage in the water and carried a net so we could pick it up,” Ann wrote in a June 7 email. “When he was old enough to go out by himself he would come back and show me all the trash he had gotten. Lake Saver Day was an important part of reinforcing what I had been tell­ing him. I hope he goes on to save the planet from ourselves but if he chooses another path I will be proud of whatever he decides.” In addition to hearing from Bolz­man, the fourth graders participated in a compass course given by HLF members Dan Correll and Rick Meeks, a water cycle presentation by Darcia Little of the Camp Grayling Environmental Of­fice, a Higgins Lake history presentation by educator Tom Dale, an erosion pre­sentation by Michigan State University Extension Forester Julie Crick, a water table demonstration by Dylan Goodell and Emma Fojtik of Huron Pines and a police equipment demonstration by the Gerrish Township Police Department.

The day began with a boat wash demonstration at the boat wash near the North Higgins Lake State Park. The demonstration showed how the boat wash works and the importance of washing boats before putting them in the water.

Items like salt, fertilizers, septic system waste, oils, dirt and invasive species were all cited as potential pollutants. RECREATIONAL USE 50 YEARS AGO During the third phase of Tom Dale’s demonstration called “The Tragedy of the Commons” students who represented the use of Higgins Lake 50 years ago put their sponges in the fish bowl and took out water. Dale said 50 years ago Higgins Lake saw an influx of people using the lake for recreational purposes.After the boat wash demonstration, the students were given a presentation by the Roscommon County Sheriff’s Marine Patrol Division. The presentation included tips for boating safety, life jacket use, safe swimming and boating regulations. RECREATIONAL USE 50 YEARS AGO During the third phase of Tom Dale’s demonstration called “The Tragedy of the Commons” students who represented the use of Higgins Lake 50 years ago put their sponges in the fish bowl and took out water. Dale said 50 years ago Higgins Lake saw an influx of people using the lake for recreational purposes. DEMONSTRATION A RESCUE SCENARIO Gerrish Township Police Department Sgt. Greg Patchin showed the students how a person with a spinal or neck injury would be retrieved during a water rescue. He said the front of the pontoon fills with water so rescuers do not have to hoist a victim in the boat. The person can be easily slid into the pontoon.The students were then divided into groups to take part in six rotational exhibits. HLF members Don Correll and Rick Meeks provided the students with a hands-on compass and navigation course. Michigan State University Extension Natural Resources Educator Julie Crick gave a shoreline erosion talk. She told the students about the causes of shoreline erosion and how to prevent erosion through greenbelt landscaping. During the morning rotations, the students were also shown how water travels through rivers with a Huron Pines water model. DEMONSTRATION A RESCUE SCENARIO Gerrish Township Police Department Sgt. Greg Patchin showed the students how a person with a spinal or neck injury would be retrieved during a water rescue. He said the front of the pontoon fills with water so rescuers do not have to hoist a victim in the boat. The person can be easily slid into the pontoon. THE END RESULT At the end of Tom Dale’s demonstration on “The Tragedy of the Commons,” the bowl which was meant to represent Higgins Lake stood dirty and with less water than when the demonstration began.The students were then provided lunch before the groups broke into the afternoon rotational schedule. During the afternoon rotational session, Gerrish Township Police Department Sgt. Greg Patchin gave a demonstration on how the department’s emergency rescue boat is used. He noted that the department has had the boat for a few years, but has not had to use it in an emergency situation. THE END RESULT At the end of Tom Dale’s demonstration on “The Tragedy of the Commons,” the bowl which was meant to represent Higgins Lake stood dirty and with less water than when the demonstration began. Patchin said the boat, which is a pontoon style vessel, is manned by three emergency workers. Two rescuers sit in the front of the boat, while a third drives in the back. When rescuing a victim who has a spinal or neck injury Patchin told the students it’s important to get the victim out of the water without causing more injuries. To help ease the victim into the boat, Patchin said the front of the pontoon fills with water so the victim can be slid into the boat and does not have to be hoisted or lifted out of the water. Once the victim in is in the boat, Patchin said the water is then released from the pontoon and they can make their way to shore to assist the victim. Gahagan Nature Preserve Educational Director Tom Dale’s focus was on the state of Higgins Lake now and in the past. Dale gave the students a presentation based on ecologist Garrett Hardin’s article “The Tragedy of the Commons.” In his presentation, Dale used a fish bowl to represent Higgins Lake. He then had each student draw a card that told them if they were a member of one of four time frames. The first group was phase one or 200 years ago when native Chippewa families used Higgins Lake. Phase two or 100 years ago represented the peak of the logging industry on Higgins Lake. Phase three or 50 years ago represented recreation at Higgins Lake and phase four or now represented the use of today. Each student used a sponge to take water out of the fish tank representing the use of the lake for each corresponding time period. During the native Chippewa families’ usage, Dale said they used the lake as much as they wanted without much disturbance to the waters. In phase two or the logging era, he said loggers would dam up areas and then use dynamite to release the water. As part of phase three or recreation 50 years ago, Dale said people began moving from the southern cities to the northern areas to get away from polio. He noted that during that time, people started to use the lake more for recreation and the lake began to be used more. During phase four or today’s use, Dale said the lake can be crowded and overused during the busy summer weekends. Dale told the students that Higgins Lake is a common use lake, meaning that anyone can use the lake as much as they want without restriction. He noted that there is no limit on use and the lake can become exploited. “Everybody owns the lake, it is common property,” Dale said. To help maintain the lake, Dale said the public must follow rules to protect the quality of the lake. He noted one of the most important rules people can follow is using the boat wash. He said boat washes help keep invasive plants and animals out of Higgins Lake that may be brought in from other lakes. He said that although conscious people with good intention use the boat washes, their efforts are negated by those who choose not to utilize the washes. At the end of the presentation when all four groups dipped their hands in the fish tank and took water out, the once clean water was dirty and the water level was lower. Dale said the end result is meant to represent the usage of Higgins Lake over the past 200 years. While Dale’s presentation was on usage, Darcia Little and Carla Elenz of the Camp Grayling Environmental Office taught the students about water pollution. As part of their presentation, they told the students that Earth has 320,000,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water and 75% of the Earth is covered with water. Other statistics included that humans are made of 65% water and humans use between 80 and 100 gallons of water a day. In order to help preserve Earth’s water, the two reviewed pollutants that should avoid being put in water. The list of pollutants include salts, fertilizer and pesticides, septic system waste, oils and greases, invasive species and trash. At the end of the day, the students were presented with certificates signifying the successful completion of Lake Saver Day. HLF Chair Vicki Springstead said that overall the day was a success and noted that Lake Saver Day was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Roscommon. She noted that funds provided by the Rotary Club helped pay for the lunch, supplies and compasses used in the navigation course. “The day went really well,” Springstead said. “I think they (the students) always get a lot out of it.” She said the goal is to provide the fourth graders with activities that are designed to spark their interest in science and ecology as well as teach them about recreation lake safety, lake preservation and stewardship. “We want to bring the wonders of nature into real life,” Springstead said.

 Breaking News: ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order to go into effect By Staff | on August 14, 2014 Having faced some criticism because the first installation of dune grass washed out, Friends of Trestle Park (FOTP) member Mary Michela addressed the Denton Township Board Aug. 6 about the need for dune grass at the park. Using a prepared written statement for her presentation, she said the grass acts as a filter for water run-off at Houghton Lake. She said the second planting is now in and, hopefully, the roots will establish themselves. Her written statement said in part: “The Friends of Trestle Park have been asked many times why we are trying so hard to establish dune grass at Trestle Park – wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper just to pave the whole waterfront and be done with it?? “First…our waterfront has taken a real beating from the very high water the past few years – this has taken a toll on the seawall at Trestle Park, and unless we can stabilize the ground behind the seawall, there is a real possibility that the seawall would need to be replaced, at significant cost to the township.” Supervisor Craig Cotterman noted that cracks in the seawall at the park have been patched. “The dune grass (American Marram Grass) that we have chosen has an extensive root system, which forms a mat of dense roots to hold the waterfront in place,” Michela’s statement continued. “This is the same type of grass found along the shores of the Great Lakes. It naturally forms an underground structure that holds the shoreline together and prevents erosion. We also took care when choosing a suitable grass that it spreads mostly through its roots, not from seed, so it will not become another invasive species. “Still, why not pave and be done with it? Well, the Friends of Trestle Park have agreed that one of our Mission Statement goals is that we are to ‘focus on ecological awareness and education.’ We are doing that with the rain garden, which filters polluted rainwater from First Street before it reaches the lake. “We also want to showcase a greenbelt or buffer zone between the turf-grass lawns of the park and the waterfront. The waterfront walkway, which is paved, creates a break from the lawns, and the greenbelt which holds the dune grass is one way to show the public that there are alternatives to having a fertilized and mowed lawn running right to the water’s edge. The dune grass not only stabilizes the sandy waterfront, it also filters runoff from the lawns and the cement walkway before it runs into the lake. If we simply paved the waterfront, all the runoff would end up in the lake. “Every time we can prevent unfiltered rainwater runoff from heading straight into the lake, that’s a good thing…even the small amount of fertilizer used on the Trestle Park lawns would add nutrients to the lake, which might sound OK, but it’s not – it adds to the pollution of our beautiful lake and adds to the problems facing our lake. “We want to be a part of the solution, not part of the problem, so we are working hard to establish the dune grass and let it do its important work.” Michela thanked the township board for being “forward thinking” and allowing the FOTP to try again to establish what members feel is a “best practices” method of handling erosion and runoff and to create an educational opportunity for the township’s waterfront community. She said some of the dune grass was set aside and that several FOTP members are “babysitting” it at their homes in case this application also has trouble getting established. “Volunteers make this community shine,” Cotterman said, following Michela’s presentation.

 Breaking News: ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order to go into effect By Staff | on March 13, 2014 In my opinion, many readers are confused by the two organizations repeatedly in the news with regard to the condition of Houghton Lake and Eurasian watermilfoil. The Houghton Lake Lake Association (HLLA) has existed for decades. It is comprised of resort owners, businessmen and people concerned with the health of Houghton Lake. The HLLA has hundreds of members who work on common causes. The Houghton Lake Improvement Board was established as mandated by state law, to further address the problems and to be able to buy chemicals. (Editor’s note: According to the HLIB, “Recognizing the need to effectively manage Houghton Lake, the Houghton Lake Improvement Board was established in 2000 under provisions of Michigan’s Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act.”) The HLIB only has seven members on their board. In my opinion, this current board condones chemical treatment above other recognized solutions, because it’s faster, not lasting, not necessarily cheaper. Milfoil can be managed with thoughtful consideration, but it’s not going away. Methods to treat combine chemical, harvesting, insect (weevil) barriers or mechanical raking. The chemicals introduced to our lake for milfoil pose serious risks. All these chemicals have warnings on their own labels as to being toxic. Fluridone has warnings of human, animal and environmental hazards, “if absorbed through the skin, swallowed or inhaled, call a poison center.” Remember this chemical kills plant life, a living organism. When the HLIB dumped chemicals in the lake without regards to a “green” approach, the HLLA became very vocal in the approach of the health of the lake. The green approaches could offset costs with environmentally safer composting, and barrier solutions or weevils as recommended. Sarah Little, Ph. D. (Wellesley Pesticide Awareness Coordinator) and Sherry Ayres (Toxic Action Center) authored the “Aquatic Herbicide Alert,” which states “Although EPA allows registration and restricted use of pesticides, they do not encourage their use. Registration of a product does not imply that it is safe; there are currently 36 EPA registered pesticides which are carcinogenic. In fact, the EPA states all ‘pesticide use creates some risk of harm to humans, animals, or the environment.’” Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of pounds of these chemicals have been introduced to our lake and we fish and swim there. The Roscommon County Democratic Party applauds the HLLA for keeping a watchful eye on the chemical pollution of our lake and demanding a greener approach to the ongoing fight against milfoil. This is not just a frontlotters problem, this is a problem for every resident in the watershed.

url: https://www.houghtonlakeresorter.com/articles/no-more-funding-for-beach-monitoring/
 Breaking News: ‘Stay Home, Stay Safe’ order to go into effect By Staff | on July 04, 2013 For more than 12 years, the Central Michigan District Health Department has conducted a bathing beach monitoring program of public beaches in the six-county district which includes Roscommon, Arenac, Clare, Gladwin, Isabella and Osceola counties. However, funding for monitoring of E. coli is no longer being provided for local beaches. “Due to reductions in funding, for the past several years the number of public beaches that were sampled for E. coli bacteria by the health department has been reduced to include only those that have the highest number of bathers and/or have had a history of high bacteria levels from past water sampling efforts,” Michelle Patton, director of Environmental Health Services with the Central Michigan District Health Department said. “As a result, campgrounds, children’s camps and many beaches open to the public have been asked by the health department to either implement a water sampling program that meets the state standards and post notices at the sites to inform the public as to whether or not the water has been tested for E. coli bacteria.” She said if residents do not see a posting at the public beach advising whether it is monitored and how to find the results of testing, they should contact the beach manager or local municipality responsible for the beach to request it post the beach. “Unfortunately, beginning in 2013, we no longer have the funding to test any public beaches in our district that are inland waters. Our funding is limited to the beaches along the Lake Huron/Saginaw Bay in Arenac County,” Patton said. “We have notified all the municipalities and beach managers in our six counties where these inland lakes and rivers are located to notify them of the requirement to post their beaches – if they are not tested for E.coli bacteria according to the Michigan Water Quality Standards for public beaches. We have also offered to work with these beach managers to assist them if they choose to undertake a sampling program.” Roscommon Township Clerk Barb Stevenson said the beach at Houghton Lake Heights has a sign posted that it is not tested. However, a three-year grant obtained by the Muskegon River Watershed Assembly through the Department of Environmental Quality is providing monitoring at 11 locations, including the beach, but only after rain events. The “Houghton Lake E. coli Reduction” project is focused on reducing E. coli in Houghton Lake and to determine specific areas where it may be coming from. In all, 52 sites at Houghton Lake are being monitored. Surface waters contaminated with high concentrations of E. coli bacteria can result in “stomach flu” type symptoms including nausea, vomiting, stomachache, diarrhea, headache and fever. Other minor illnesses associated with swimming in contaminated waters include ear, eye, nose and throat infections and skin rashes. In highly polluted waters, swimmers run the risk of exposure to more serious diseases like dysentery, hepatitis, cholera and typhoid fever. “By monitoring our public swimming areas throughout the summer season, we can ensure public safety by warning of high levels of harmful bacteria,” Patton said. When it comes to making a personal decision as to which beaches to spend your summer days on, keep in mind the following tips: • Large amounts of waterfowl present (geese, ducks) could mean an increased amount of “bird droppings” which may contain high concentrations of E. coli bacteria or could lead to swimmers itch. • Do not swim in public beaches if you have open sores or lesions on your body. • Research the number of closings the beach has had in the most recent years. • If there has been a heavy rain event within the past 48 hours, use caution in swimming due to possible runoff and higher levels of bacteria in the water. • If the water is discolored with a greenish, blue or milky look this may indicate an algae bloom. Certain algae blooms can produce toxins that could make someone ill. • Public beaches that are used by a large number of people, especially small children, could contain body fluids and fecal matter. • Talk to the local residents who often times have a good perspective on the history of the beach. • Don’t swim where the beach has an overabundance of trash and litter. • Dry off immediately with a clean towel after getting out of the water. It is also a good idea to take a shower after spending a day at the beach. These two tips may help reduce your chance of getting swimmer’s itch.

url: https://www.ironmountaindailynews.com/news/local-news/2020/02/wisconsin-assembly-passes-bill-on-pfas-pollution/
 Feb 21, 2020 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Assembly Republicans hastily put together a bill addressing PFAS contamination and pushed it through to the Senate early Friday morning, just moments before adjourning for the year. The bill gives Rep. John Nygren of Marinette cover on the campaign trail this summer. His northeastern Wisconsin district has been hit hard by PFAS groundwater pollution. PFAS are man-made chemicals that research suggests can decrease female fertility, increase the risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women and lower birth weights. The chemicals have been used for decades in a range of products, including firefighting foam, nonstick cookware, fast-food wrappers and stain-resistant sprays. Nygren and Democratic state Sen. Dave Hansen of Green Bay put together a sweeping bill addressing PFAS contamination in January that called for emergency rules limiting the amount of PFAS in ground and surface water as well as air emissions, grants for municipalities to address PFAS pollution, sampling wildlife for contamination and free blood testing for people living near polluted areas in Marinette, Peshtigo and Porterfield. The measure sputtered out amid pushback from powerful business groups, including Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the Wisconsin Dairy Alliance and the Wisconsin Paper Council. Nygren said on the Assembly floor Friday morning that the bill’s opponents used “scare tactics” to frighten people into thinking the proposal would cost jobs. He also said it was difficult to gather legislative support for the bill since PFAS contamination is more of a local problem than a statewide issue. Still, he convinced his fellow Republicans during a break in debate on other bills to let him amend a measure setting bidding requirements for lake rehabilitation projects to address PFAS. The amendment would require a new University of Wisconsin System freshwater collaborative to study PFAS pollution and report back to the Legislature by Jan. 1. The Assembly passed a bill earlier this week laying out funding for the collaborative. That measure is now in the Senate. The Department of Natural Resources would have to develop emergency rules for certifying laboratories to test for the presence of PFAS; test for PFAS in municipal water systems and private wells near contaminated sites and provide clean drinking water for people in those areas; and request whatever money it needs to address PFAS in the next state budget. Nygren acknowledged the amendment doesn’t go nearly as far as the bill that he and Hansen crafted but said, “I don’t want to walk away from this opportunity without providing some answers … and some certainty for my constituents.” Democrats lobbied Republicans to pass the original bill to no avail. In the end the chamber approved the amendment on a voice vote. They passed the bill on a 62-35 party line vote moments before Republican leaders ended the floor period and with it the Assembly’s work for the year.

 Jan 31, 2020 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Two northeastern Wisconsin lawmakers introduced sweeping legislation Thursday designed to curb water and air pollution from man-made chemicals known as PFAS. Rep. John Nygren, a Marinette Republican, and Sen. Dave Hansen, a Green Bay Democrat, have been working on the package for months in a rare display of bipartisanship on a major issue in Madison’s toxic political world. Each lawmaker’s district includes both the Marinette and Peshtigo areas, which have been hard hit with PFAS pollution believed to have originated from firefighting foam. Tyco Fire Products, a unit of Johnson Controls, discovered in 2013 that soil and well contamination on its Marinette fire training property contained PFAS. Four years later, the company acknowledged that the chemicals had spread beyond the facility. “Unfortunately, Marinette and Peshtigo have become the epicenter of PFAS contamination in Wisconsin,” Nygren said in a video posted on his Twitter account. “While we are still learning about these chemicals, it’s important we act quickly to keep them from entering our drinking water. This bill will be a significant step forward.” PFAS are man-made chemicals that research suggests can decrease female fertility, increase the risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women and lower birth weights. The chemicals have been used for decades in a range of products, including firefighting foam, non-stick cookware, fast food wrappers and stain-resistant sprays. The chemicals have drawn more scrutiny in recent years as potentially toxic contaminants in ground and surface water. The new bill would allocate $7.7 million over the biennium toward efforts to slow contamination and clean up polluted areas. The legislation would provide $5 million to create new grants for municipalities to address PFAS contamination when the polluting party is unknown, can’t be found or can’t pay for remediation. The money could also be used to investigate potential PFAS pollution or discharges. The state Department of Natural Resources would get $1 million to test water systems for PFAS pollution, $150,000 to sample wildlife for PFAS contamination and $120,000 to provide temporary drinking water or treatment system when a party responsible for contamination isn’t available. The University of Wisconsin System, meanwhile, would get $250,000 to research ways to destroy PFAS. All of the money would come out of the state’s environmental fund. The DNR would be required to put emergency rules in place establishing PFAS limits for groundwater and set out surface water, drinking water and air emission standards. Democrat Tony Evers already has ordered the DNR to establish permanent groundwater and surface water standards for PFAS, but that process could take years. Nygren said the department could put emergency rules in place much faster. State health officials would be required to offer free blood testing by September to people living near PFAS-contaminated sites in Marinette, the Peshtigo area and Porterfield. Polluters would have to reimburse the costs. Health officials also would have to conduct a cancer study in those areas. The bill also would create a new trust fund to hold money the state wins in PFAS-related litigation. The measure’s prospects look uncertain. Aides for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald didn’t immediately reply to messages inquiring about the bill’s chances in each chamber. Time is running out; both houses expect to wrap up their two-year sessions by March. Nygren said in a phone interview that he had spoken with Vos and Fitzgerald and that he’s optimistic both chambers will hold votes on the bill. Evers issued a statement saying he hopes the bill will reach his desk so he can sign it into law. The bill comes a little more than a week after the Legislature passed another Nygren bill restricting the use of firefighting foam containing PFAS. That measure is sitting on Evers desk. His spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, didn’t return a message asking if the governor would sign it.

 Jun 10, 2019 MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Wisconsin company failed to report the release of hazardous materials at a property in Marinette that resulted in some residents unknowingly drinking contaminated water for years, the state Department of Natural Resources said. The DNR has referred the matter to the state Department of Justice for civil prosecution, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The agency alleges a unit of Glendale, Wis.-based Johnson Controls failed to inform state officials it knew that so-called forever chemicals had been found at a fire training facility in northeastern Wisconsin and did not take steps to minimize their impact. Johnson Controls said in a statement Friday it believed the contamination was confined to its property and it wasn’t obligated to notify authorities when the chemicals were first detected. Johnson Controls’ Tyco Fire Products uses the perfluorinated chemicals in the manufacture of fire retardants. For decades, the compounds have been an essential ingredient in firefighting chemicals and have been used at its training site on the edge of town. The chemicals resist breaking down in the environment and have been discovered in private wells in the Marinette area. They also have been found in trace levels in the municipal water system, and they have turned up in local streams and offshore in Green Bay. Epidemiology studies that were cited in a federal report last year suggested that the compounds can lead to increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, liver damage, thyroid disease, asthma, decreased fertility, some cancers and a drop in responses to vaccines. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in February that state records showed that Tyco had test results of soil and well contamination from the chemicals on its property dating back to October 2013 as part an effort to remove long-standing gasoline compounds from the property. In November 2017, Tyco reported that it believed the chemicals had spread outside its 380-acre fire technology center, where testing and training have gone on since at least 1962. The following month, the company began distributing bottled water to residents whose private wells might have been affected. Tyco and Johnson Controls are currently providing bottled water to 125 residents. The companies have installed 38 water treatment systems on properties. Douglas Oitzinger, a former mayor of Marinette, said Tyco should have responded quicker. “If you have a forest fire going on your property, you don’t assume that it’s not going to jump to the neighbors’ property and you don’t report it,” Oitzinger said. The pollution problems first came to light under the industry-friendly administration of Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who was replaced in January by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. “I don’t know if this reflects a normal process, or if this is attributed to a change in administrations,” Oitzinger said. “But I think it was pretty clear cut that Johnson Controls, or Tyco at the time, had an obligation to report this in 2013 and they didn’t do it.” IRON MOUNTAIN — Dickinson County Healthcare System will delay a planned sale of up to $32 million in revenue ...

 Apr 8, 2019 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Two of Wisconsin’s most polluted sites on the Great Lakes are marking cleanup milestones, after the state Department of Natural Resources declared both waterways to be no longer impaired. The Lower Menominee River and the St. Louis River are among five areas in the state designated as Areas of Concern and featured on a list of most contaminated sites on the Great Lakes. The department removed impairment designations for the two rivers in February, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. The Lower Menominee River was listed for arsenic, coal tar, oil and grease pollution. The river originally had six out of 14 types of impairment classifications set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The removal of the site’s last remaining impairment for degraded fish and wildlife populations could result in its removal from the Great Lakes contamination list this year. It would become the first site in Wisconsin to be removed from the list, said Kendra Axness, Area of Concern and Lakewide Action and Management Plan policy coordinator with the Wisconsin DNR. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative , which was launched by former President Barack Obama, has provided about $300 million each year for cleanup efforts around the Great Lakes since 2010. The initiative has been vital to the restoration progress, Axness said. “The acceleration of the progress that’s been accomplished by the GLRI is really astounding,” she said. “I hope we get to continue to keep doing this good work because I think we’re making really good progress.” The impairment against the St. Louis River was removed after scientists confirmed that the health of the river’s fish population has improved, the DNR said. Scientists conducted multiple studies of the river from 2011 to 2015. Researchers found that less than 5% of the roughly 620 white suckers that were examined had skin or liver tumors, a rate lower than elsewhere in the Great Lakes, said Matt Steiger, St. Louis River AOC coordinator with the DNR. “The sucker is an important food source for a lot of other game fish that people are out there pursuing,” said Steiger. “If that’s a healthy population, we can hope that’s reciprocated through other sought-after species in the estuary.” IRON MOUNTAIN — Dickinson County Healthcare System will delay a planned sale of up to $32 million in revenue ...

 Jun 19, 2018 MARINETTE, Wis. (AP) — A manufacturer in northeastern Wisconsin has discovered new evidence of groundwater pollution near Lake Michigan involving a chemical that has raised national health concerns. Tyco Fire Products said this month that it discovered perfluorinated chemicals, or PFCs, in well samples at its manufacturing plant in Marinette. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had directed Tyco to test for PFCs at the wells, which are part of a separate cleanup of arsenic. Tyco produces specialized firefighting foams that can extinguish gas and oil fires. PFCs are used in products like the firefighting foam and have been linked with increasing cancer risks and development problems in fetuses, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported . Tyco, which is a unit of Johnson Controls International, said it’s investigating the source and extent of the groundwater contamination by testing soil, ditches and surface water. Elevated levels of PFCs appeared in Marinette’s wastewater treatment system during November and May testing, according to records from the city and the Department of Natural Resources. Effluent is released into the river after waste is treated. The leftover sludge has typically been spread on farm fields. The DNR has directed the city to test the sludge samples and officials are waiting for the lab results. It’s uncertain if Tyco is the source of the wastewater contamination and it’s too early to determine the impact of the sludge on soil, crops and livestock, according to DNR officials. Trace amounts of the chemicals have also been found in the city’s municipal drinking water, according to records from the city and the DNR. The levels are low and aren’t considered a danger to public health, city and DNR officials said. Johnson Controls spokesman Fraser Engerman said since PFC compounds are often used in consumer and commercial products, “it is difficult to determine all potential sources of these compounds.” IRON MOUNTAIN — Dickinson County Healthcare System will delay a planned sale of up to $32 million in revenue ...

 Aug 11, 2017 WASHINGTON (AP) — Fines for illegal pollution have plummeted under President Donald Trump, according to analysis by an environmental advocacy group. The Environmental Integrity Project looked at civil penalties paid by polluters during the first six months under Trump. The group published an analysis Thursday that found penalties were less than half their levels under each of the past three presidents. The analysis found Trump’s Justice Department settled 26 civil cases against companies over environmental violations, totaling $12 million in penalties. That’s a 60 percent drop on average from comparable time periods under presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush or Bill Clinton, even before adjustments for inflation. Besides reaching fewer settlements, the group said, environmental offenders also were required to perform less cleanup under Trump and make smaller reductions to future pollution. The report’s authors cautioned that six months represent only an eighth of a presidential term but said the early news is neither encouraging nor surprising. Trump and his Environmental Enforcement Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, have complained that federal regulations are often too onerous and stifle the growth of American businesses. “President Trump campaigned on a promise of ‘law and order,’ but apparently law enforcement for big polluters is not what he had in mind,” Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement. He previously served as director of EPA’s civil enforcement office under both Clinton and Bush. Under the first six months under Obama, the Justice Department brought 34 civil cases for violations of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and other federal environmental laws, with polluters agreeing to pay $36 million in penalties. Bush logged 31 cases with $30 million in penalties, while Clinton accounted for 45 cases with $25 million in penalties. The group did not include settlements for pollution cleanups agreed to as part of the federal Superfund program, cases that can often drag on for decades. The comparison between presidential administrations is more stark when figures are adjusted for inflation. For example, the $25 million in civil penalties under Clinton in the first half of 1992 would equal more than $43.5 million in today’s dollars. A Justice Department spokesman said figures for civil penalties do not tell the full story because they do not include fines from criminal prosecutions. “The department continues to vigorously enforce environmental laws to better protect the American people,” said Mark Abueg, a Justice public affairs specialist. “For example, in just the last six months, (we) filed major new Clean Air Act litigation and obtained a $40 million criminal penalty in a vessel pollution case that safeguards the environment.” The $40 million fine Abueg cited was finalized in April as part of the sentencing of Princess Cruise Lines over the illegal dumping and concealment of oil-contaminated waste from its ships. However, the settlement, the largest ever in such a case, was actually negotiated under the Obama administration and announced in December — the month before Trump took office — as part of the company’s guilty plea to felony crimes in federal court.

 Feb 28, 2020 TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — A Michigan oversight panel Thursday endorsed drinking water standards designed to limit exposure to a group of household and industrial chemicals linked to a variety of health problems. The proposed rules would apply to seven compounds in a category known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. They have been used for decades in products ranging from nonstick cookware to stain-resistant clothing and food containers, as well as foam used to extinguish jet-fuel fires. They’re known as “forever chemicals” because they persist indefinitely in the environment without breaking down. Members of Congress announced Thursday the Air Force would spend $13.5 million cleaning up PFAS water pollution near the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, Michigan. Thousands of PFAS compounds have been developed. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy crafted drinking water standards for just seven because they’re the only ones for which there is enough scientific data to justify regulation, spokesman Scott Dean said. Their acceptance by the Environmental Rules Review Committee was a key step. The state legislature established the panel in 2018 at the urging of Republicans who described it as a check on excessively burdensome regulation. Among its members are representatives of business and industry sectors including oil and gas, agriculture and manufacturing. At their urging, the panel delayed action on the PFAS rules last fall. But it approved the proposals Thursday on a 8-0 vote, with two members abstaining. The decision “shows there is broad support for rules that protect Michiganders from contaminants in their drinking water,” said Liesl Clark, director of the environment department. The rules still need approval of the legislature’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules before taking effect. They would cover about 2,700 drinking water systems, requiring them to conduct periodic testing and inform the public of results. The environment department forwarded its proposals to the oversight panel last October. The panel considered them in two meetings and took public feedback. While the overwhelming majority of written comments were supportive, some raised concern about the costs of meeting the standards or said the rules were put together too quickly. Smaller drinking water suppliers “don’t have the ability to pass that cost along on any non-painful way to ratepayers,” Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau, said during Thursday’s meeting in Lansing. John Dulmes, executive director of the Michigan Chemistry Council, said the department hadn’t provided enough scientific justification for some of the provisions. Panel member Grant Trigger, an engineer who manages cleanups of former General Motors properties, questioned whether the standards, although designed for drinking water, might affect users of PFAS-tainted compost or sewage byproducts known as biosolids. Department officials said they would move slowly on dealing with contaminated soils. The oversight committee agreed to send the legislative rules committee a memo outlining criticisms that had been submitted. But supporters said there was no need for further delay. “None of us sitting at this table are toxicologists,” said Eric Pessell, a member from Delton representing public health professionals. He said the department gave due regard to objections and ran them past a science advisory group but found no reason to adjust the proposed limits. Environmental groups said the limits were essential to safeguard Michigan’s water from the chemicals, which studies have linked to testicular cancer, damage to organs including the liver and kidneys, reproductive system harm. “While we continue to believe that a panel stacked with industry special interests shouldn’t have an oversight role over rules designed to protect our environment and public health, we are glad that the committee took the right step and approved these critical drinking water protections,” said Charlotte Jameson, a program director for the Michigan Environmental Council.

 Jan 22, 2020 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin Republicans signed off Tuesday on a bill that would impose new restrictions on firefighting foam containing PFAS chemicals in the hopes of reducing soil and water contamination, despite Democrats’ complaints that the proposal would accomplish next to nothing. The Senate approved the Republican-authored measure with a voice vote Tuesday afternoon. The Assembly followed suit with its own voice vote later in the day. The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who can sign it into law or veto it. Evers’ spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, didn’t respond to an email asking whether he supports the bill. The governor has made improving water quality a priority, though; he signed an executive order in August directing the Department of Natural Resources to develop regulatory limits on PFAS. The department’s board is set to vote Wednesday on whether to authorize the department to begin drafting those standards. Democrats in both chambers railed against the bill, insisting that it doesn’t go far enough in combating PFAS contamination. “(The foam bill) does not change anything. It does not deal with existing contamination. We need to do much more,” Democratic Sen. Mark Miller said. “(PFAS contamination) is not just hypothetical. This is real. This is something we need to respond to.” The bill’s chief Senate sponsor, Republican Robert Cowles, said the proposal is a start and pledged that more legislation will be coming. In the meantime, it makes no sense to reject a proposal that will protect firefighters, he said. Republican Rep. John Nygren, the bill’s chief Assembly sponsor, also promised that the measure wouldn’t be the last attempt to deal with PFAS pollution. “This bill is not the sole solution to the problem,” he said. “We all want clean drinking water.” PFAS are man-made chemicals that research suggests can decrease female fertility, increase the risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women and lower birth weights. The chemicals have been used for decades in a range of products, including firefighting foam, non-stick cookware, fast food wrappers and stain-resistant sprays.

The company began distributing bottled water to residents whose wells may have been contaminated. Under the bill, the use of firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS would generally be prohibited except in emergency fire situations.

 Jan 21, 2020 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin lawmakers are poised to pass a bill that would impose new restrictions on the use of firefighting foam containing chemicals known as PFAS to reduce soil and water contamination. Both the Senate and Assembly are scheduled to vote on the Republican-authored proposal Tuesday. The GOP controls both houses, making passage all but certain. The bill would go next to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who can sign it into law or veto it. Evers’ spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff didn’t respond to an email asking whether he supports the bill. Democrats have argued the measure doesn’t go far enough in reducing pollution caused by PFAS and they planned to push for even more limitations. Evers has made improving water quality a priority, though; he signed an executive order in August directing the Department of Natural Resources to develop regulatory limits on PFAS. The DNR’s board is set to vote Wednesday on whether to authorize the department to begin drafting those standards. PFAS are man-made chemicals that research suggests can decrease female fertility, increase the risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women and lower birth weights.

Tyco Fire Products discovered in 2013 that soil and well contamination on its Marinette fire training property contained PFAS and four years later acknowledged that the chemicals had spread beyond the facility. The company began distributing bottled water to residents whose wells may have been contaminated. Traces of PFAS also have been found in a number of wells in Madison. State health officials recently warned people to limit consumption of fish from Madison’s Lake Monona due to PFAS contamination. The state Department of Natural Resources hasn’t identified the source, but firefighters have trained with foam for years at the Dane County Regional Airport. Under the bill, the use of firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS would generally be prohibited except in emergency fire situations. Firefighters would have to train with foam or other substances that don’t contain the chemicals. Foam containing PFAS could be used in testing as long as the testing facility has implemented DNR-approved containment and disposal measures to prevent releases into the environment. Violators would face forfeitures of up to $5,000 per incident. MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Gov. Tony Evers said Monday that he will order the closure of all nonessential businesses ... MADISON, Wis.

 Jan 11, 2020 MILWAUKEE (AP) –Thirty-year-old Conner Andrews has swum in Lake Michigan since his childhood days vacationing in Door County. “It was always a huge deal for me to go to the beach and have fun there and enjoy the waves,” said Andrews, a Nashotah resident and former collegiate swimmer. These days he gets the same feeling swimming at Milwaukee-area beaches. But he must pick his waters and timing wisely –î to avoid wading into a contaminated stew of pollutants that might swirl in some locations. That includes bacteria-laden stormwater and sewage flowing into local waterways. Parts of the Milwaukee area rely on a combined sewer system to collect stormwater and sewage for treatment. But increasingly heavy rains can overwhelm the sewers, sending untreated waste into local rivers and Lake Michigan. The overflows hinder locals who like to fish and swim. And they can contribute to beach closures and make people sick. The wastewater flows intensified in 2018, even as the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District spends millions of dollars on a plan to eliminate overflows by 2035, state data show. In 2018, the agency overseeing Milwaukee’s system, which serves 1.1 million people and 28 communities, saw six combined sewer overflows — the most events since 1999. Those overflows sent 1.2 billion gallons of stormwater and untreated sewage into rivers, canals and a stream that drain into Lake Michigan. Milwaukee’s latest discharges come after the sewerage district spent $2.3 billion on pollution abatement in the 1980s and ’90s, including construction of what is now a 28.5-mile tunnel system to cut overflows into Lake Michigan. The city is not alone in grappling with overflows. Wisconsin in 2018 saw its most overflow events since 2010, with increasing volumes of discharged waste, Department of Natural Resources data show. Experts say the problem plagues communities across the Great Lakes, a drinking water source for 48 million people in the United States and Canada. Driving the spike: intensifying rainfall due to climate change. Investment at all levels of government has fallen short in addressing aging sewer systems overwhelmed by the increasing flows. “We’re seeing more extreme storms across the Great Lakes region, and you’ve got a recipe for some serious problems,” said Joel Brammeier, president and CEO of the nonprofit Alliance for the Great Lakes. Andrews has sought to draw attention to Milwaukee’s water quality pollution challenges by organizing the Cream City Classic, in which contestants swim a 1.5-mile portion of the Milwaukee River that mixes with Lake Michigan. Organizers held the first race in August 2018, specifically choosing that time when heavy rainfall was thought to be less likely. Rains have not thwarted the race in its first two years, but Andrews said he would not be surprised if that happens one day. Less than three weeks after the 2018 race, for instance, intense rainfall sent nearly 395 million gallons of stormwater and sewage into the Milwaukee River and other local waters. As Wisconsin’s largest city, Milwaukee’s sewage system leads in wastewater releases. In 2018, it discharged more than eight times more waste than systems in the rest of the state combined, due to wet weather, according to DNR data. Milwaukee’s latest sewage surge into Lake Michigan follows decades of major progress on the issue. About 8 to 9 billion gallons once overflowed from Milwaukee’s combined sewer system each year. That was before the sewerage district started building its Deep Tunnel in the 1980s, a 521-million gallon storage system 300 feet underground that collects sewage and stormwater until it can be treated and discharged. The tunnel, built in three phases, dramatically cut overflows after 1994, the first full year its initial 19.4-mile phase went into service. It helps the district treat more than 98% of its wastewater in a typical year, keeping at least 128 billion gallons of polluted water out of Lake Michigan. But increasingly heavy rains are now adding more stress to the city’s sewer system. The Milwaukee sewerage district’s two wastewater plants collectively treat up to 600 million gallons of stormwater and sewage each day. But just one inch of rain across the district’s 411 square-mile service area equals more than 7 billion gallons of water. “It’s when you get two inches of rain in 20 minutes that it overwhelms the sewer system,” said Bill Graffin, the district’s spokesman. Steve Vavrus, senior scientist with the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Nelson Institute Center for Climatic Research, said climate change is driving Wisconsin’s record rainfall. Last year was the wettest in the state’s recorded state history, while 2018 was third-wettest, according to data from the Midwestern Regional Climate Center. Excluding Milwaukee, Wisconsin communities in 2018 discharged 150 million gallons of sewage and stormwater. That was the highest volume since 2010, the fifth-wettest year on record. As of October 2019, 359 million gallons overflowed from those communities’ systems, while Milwaukee discharged more than 500 million gallons into waterways. That happened even as the Milwaukee district captured and cleaned a record 85.6 billion gallons of water. Climate scientists expect the region’s rains will only intensify as worldwide carbon dioxide emissions speed earth’s warming. That could send more pathogens into the water, said Sandra McLellan, a professor with the School of Freshwater Sciences at UW-Milwaukee. “Instead of that happening once a year, it’s going to happen two or three times a year,” she said. In one extreme 1993 case, the waterborne-parasite cryptosporidium sickened an estimated 403,000 people in a five-county area around Milwaukee, according to the American Journal of Public Health. Later research linked 54 deaths to the outbreak, mostly AIDS patients. The outbreak followed heavy rainfall, and experts speculated that human sewage and waste from slaughtered livestock and other animals contributed to the outbreak. Milwaukee has invested $508 million in treatment upgrades and monitoring to prevent a future outbreak. But other communities remain vulnerable to pollution caused by heavy rains and runoff. In a 2018 study, McLellan and other researchers found that gastrointestinal pathogens are “widespread in urban waterways following rainfall and 10-fold higher following (combined sewer overflows).” Researchers are increasingly flagging high levels of E. coli at beaches in Milwaukee and elsewhere along Wisconsin’s Great Lakes shorelines. The bacteria arrive in human, bird and animal feces, triggering beach closures and advisories that have spanned more than 60% of summer days at Milwaukee’s South Shore Beach. That beach and Maslowski Beach in Ashland are among those most prone to closure from unsafe swimming conditions, according to a July 2019 report from the advocacy group Environment America. The contamination worries Melodie Phipps of Ashland. She loved to walk barefoot along the sandy shoreline of Maslowski Beach and swim in Lake Superior’s Chequamegon Bay. But that was before she learned that Ashland is among cities struggling with sewer overflows. Now, she steers clear of the water. “I feel a huge grief –î huge sadness and a longing on a hot day when the humidity is 95% and you’re just sweating and it’s sunny,” she said. Researchers at Northland College in Ashland regularly sample water quality along the city’s beaches. More than 30% of samples collected between 2014 and 2016 exceeded federal water quality standards for E. coli. The bacteria stemmed from a variety of sources, researchers noted. In many cases, seagulls appear to be the most dominant contributor, said Matt Hudson, associate director with the Mary Griggs Burke Center for Freshwater Innovation at Northland. McLellan said similar studies have shown high levels of E. coli at Milwaukee beaches come mostly from shoreline runoff and wildlife –î not sewer overflows. But the discharges are a prime source for the pathogens most likely to cause illness, she added. “If I had to say what’s the most serious pollution sources, it’s sewage and any kind of human contamination.” In 2012, Wisconsin’s roughly 600 publicly owned wastewater systems reported needing a collective $6.3 billion in extra investment to meet federal water quality goals –î nearly half for pipeline construction or repair and managing stormwater. That includes Ashland. More than one-third of its sewer pipes are more than 50 years old, and nearly half are past their useful life, said John Butler, the city’s public works director. Ashland’s wastewater treatment plant can handle up to 2,700 gallons per minute. But heavy rain events can increase flows 12-fold, overwhelming the plant. More than 6 inches of rain hit Ashland during Father’s Day weekend 2018, sending 15 million gallons of wastewater into Lake Superior. Ashland’s overflows happen when water seeps into cracked pipes or into connections between the stormwater and sanitary sewer systems, Butler said. Since 1991, the DNR has awarded more than $4.6 billion in loans and assistance for roughly 1,000 sewage and stormwater projects, with about 30% of funding going to Milwaukee, according to the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Jim Ritchie, DNR environmental loan section chief, said funding requests are only increasing. About 96% of U.S. spending on water and wastewater projects comes from state and local governments, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The federal government chipped in billions for water and wastewater programs in the 2019 fiscal year, but its investment has declined in recent years amid competing priorities in Washington. Local governments are forging ahead with their own limited resources. Beginning next year, Ashland plans to spend about $600,000 annually for deferred upkeep while also seeking state loans, Butler said. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant also helped the city install a grassy channel at Maslowski Beach designed to capture and treat stormwater. Along Lake Michigan, the Milwaukee sewerage district is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into flood control along watersheds. It set a goal of zero overflows by 2035 by adding 740 million gallons of stormwater storage. The district estimates it will cost at least $1.3 billion to install green roofs, rain gardens and other projects to capture water across its service area. “We really live by the mantra that every drop counts,” said Kevin Shafer, the district’s executive director.

 Jan 9, 2020 WISCONSIN STATE REP. Todd Novak, center, gathers members of a bipartisan water pollution task force in the state Capitol in Madison, Wis., Wednesday to announce recommendations for curbing contamination from manure and fertilizer. (AP Photo/Todd Richmond) MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A bipartisan water pollution task force proposed more than a dozen bills Wednesday designed to curb contamination across Wisconsin, capping a year’s worth of research and discussion. Groundwater pollution has been a growing problem in Wisconsin over the last 20 years, creating a rift between environmentalists and the farmers they blame for contaminating wells and water bodies by spreading manure and fertilizers. The agricultural industry has become more concerned since Democratic Gov. Tony Evers took office last year that his cabinet agencies could impose costly new regulations. The package released Wednesday calls for the state to spend $10 million on a range of initiatives including: creating a new water policy office; bumping up state funding for county conservation workers; increasing grants for rebuilding or replacing wells contaminated with manure and fertilizer; and grants for farmers who grow crops that require less fertilizer. “It’s clear we can’t just throw money at these issues, thinking they’ll immediately go away,” Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who created the task force, said in a statement. “Wisconsin needs a long-term strategy to protect, preserve and promote clean water. These bills are a first step toward that goal.” The bills must pass the Assembly and Senate and be signed by Evers before becoming law. The Senate has proven to be a roadblock for many proposals that have come from previous Assembly task forces. Alec Zimmerman, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, had no immediate comment on chances for the water proposals. Time is running out for action this year. The Legislature is expected to be in session only a handful of days this spring, adjourning perhaps as early as February. Evers’ spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, said in a statement that the governor was glad to see lawmakers following his lead on water pollution. Evers declared 2019 the “Year of Clean Drinking Water” when he came into office last year. He released his own report earlier Wednesday touting his administration’s efforts to improve water quality. Evers’ report noted that the state Department of Resources has started drawing up restrictions on manure and fertilizer in areas prone to groundwater pollution and is developing standards for PFAS, chemicals found in firefighting foam. The report added that the DNR also is working on educating people about the health hazards of lead pipes and developing a program to forgive loans for replacing such pipes. “Tens of thousands of people in Wisconsin are afraid to turn on their tap to drink water,” Evers is quoted as saying in the report. “That is unacceptable, and we must fix it.” Vos created the task force a year ago at the request of Republican Reps. Travis Tranel and Todd Novak, who represent portions of Grant, Iowa and Lafayette counties in southwestern Wisconsin. Scientists have been testing wells in that region for contamination. So far they’ve found at least 60 wells polluted with fecal matter from humans and livestock. The task force, made up of 12 Republican and four Democratic legislators, held 14 public hearings on water quality around the state over the past year. The panel’s proposals include: creating a new Office of Water Policy within the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey; increasing state funding for county land and water conservation workers; and increasing grants for rebuilding or replacing wells contaminated with nitrates, which originate from manure and fertilizer. Other provisions include creating new grants for farmers who grow crops that require less fertilizer and extending a grant program for private septic system repairs for another two years.

 Dec 10, 2019 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An updated environmental review released by a state agency Monday found no serious threat to Lake Superior if crude oil ever leaked from a new pipeline to replace Enbridge Energy’s aging Line 3 across northern Minnesota. State regulators ordered the update after the Minnesota Court of Appeals in June declared that an earlier review, issued in February 2018, was inadequate because it failed to specifically address the potential impacts of a spill into the Lake Superior watershed. Line 3 carries Canadian crude from Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota on its way across Minnesota to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. The replacement would double the capacity of the existing line, which was built in the 1960s and is increasingly subject to cracking and corrosion. Environmental and tribal groups have been fighting the project because of the potential for spills in the Mississippi River headwaters region — an important wild rice growing area — and other pristine waters, and because the oil would contribute to climate change. The update issued by the state Department of Commerce modeled the potential impacts of a spill where the replacement pipeline would cross Little Otter Creek. The department said a spill there would be more likely to enter the St. Louis River, with the potential for flowing downstream into Lake Superior, than other sites it could have modeled. A public comment period on the update runs through Jan. 16. Interested parties will also be allowed to comment in person before an administrative law judge in Duluth on Dec. 19. Officials with Enbridge, based in Calgary, Alberta, welcomed the report. They told reporters that if the Public Utilities Commission deems the update adequate, they hope to start construction of the Minnesota and North Dakota segments of the replacement pipeline in mid-2020. Construction would then take seven to nine months. The upgraded Canadian and Wisconsin segments are already in service. Enbridge estimates that the 350-mile Minnesota segment will cost $2.6 billion, with the entire U.S. segment costing $2.9 billion. The hypothetical modeling considered what would happen in the event of a ruptured pipeline at full flow near the creek if Enbridge failed to fight the spill within 24 hours — essentially a worst-case scenario. Enbridge officials said their actual response would include immediate and aggressive moves to address the spill and begin the cleanup. The report said some oil might float down the St. Louis River to a dam where it would mix with the turbulent water. It said the most significant environmental impact would be potential short-term effects on fish right below the dam due to toxic components in the oil. But past the dam, it said, any oil remaining on the surface after 24 hours would likely wash up on shore without reaching Lake Superior. “The modeling confirms there is no introduction of risk to Lake Superior with a crude oil release,” project director Barry Simonson said on a conference call with reporters. Climate change activists said the updated review didn’t go far enough. “The PUC has produced yet another inadequate review that fails to recognize that this pipeline would pose an unacceptable risk to Minnesota’s clean water and should never be built,” said Margaret Levin, director of the Sierra Club’s Minnesota chapter. “Now it’s more important than ever that Governor (Tim) Walz and the Pollution Control Agency do everything in their power to stop this dirty tar sands pipeline once and for all.” IRON MOUNTAIN — Dickinson County Healthcare System will delay a planned sale of up to $32 million in revenue ...

 Nov 9, 2019 In this undated photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a group of people take a walk through the Eagle Ridge project area, located east of Midland. Dow Chemical Co. has agreed to fund environmental restoration projects worth an estimated $77 million to compensate for decades of pollution by its plant in Midland, officials said Friday TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — Dow Chemical Co. has agreed to fund environmental restoration projects worth an estimated $77 million to compensate for decades of pollution by its plant in Midland, Michigan, officials said Friday. A deal between the company and government agencies calls for improvements to fish and wildlife habitats tainted by dioxins and other hazardous substances from Dow’s manufacturing complex in its headquarters city of Midland. The chemical giant also will pay for new public recreation areas with trails, fishing platforms and boating launches. “This settlement has been more than a decade in the making by a combined team of state, federal and tribal partners working together for the benefit of Michigan’s environment and precious natural resources,” state Attorney General Dana Nessel said. The agreement would be legally binding and needs a federal judge’s approval to take effect. It would resolve a complaint filed by government agencies that alleges the company’s pollution harmed birds, fish, invertebrates and mammals in the Tittabawassee and Saginaw rivers and their watersheds. Dow’s facility began operating in 1897. For generations it dumped or incinerated wastes that contaminated the 50-mile-long river valley, which extends into Lake Huron’s Saginaw Bay, with dioxins and related compounds linked to cancer and other illnesses. Cleanup of the Tittabawassee River began in 2007 and is expected to be finished in 2021. No completion date has been set for the other waterways. The pollution has prompted warnings to limit consumption of some fish and wild game, and to avoid touching the soil in certain areas, including parks. Under the agreement, Dow will pay for 13 natural resource projects in Midland, Saginaw and Bay counties that will affect a combined 8,000 acres. Construction of a fish passage ramp at a Tittabawassee River dam will provide hundreds of miles of new habitat for migratory species, while the state Department of Natural Resources will get funding to build spawning reefs in Saginaw Bay. Other projects will protect and restore wetlands, farmlands and forests. About 2,000 acres of private land will be shielded from development through conservation easements. An expansion of the Shiawassee National Wildlife Reserve will provide more room for hunting. Biking and nature trails will be developed in preserved Tittabawassee flood plain areas habitat south of Midland. As part of the settlement, Dow will pay $15 million to a team of trustees including officials with state and federal agencies and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan. Some of the money will be used to maintain and monitor the effectiveness of the 13 projects, while at least $5 million will fund additional natural resource initiatives selected by the trustees with advice from the public. Dow also will reimburse government agencies for costs of studying how its pollution affected the environment. In a statement, the company said it was “committed to working cooperatively with the … trustees to move forward with implementation of the proposed restoration plan over the next five years” and had set aside money to pay for the settlement. The trustees will host a public meeting Nov. 21 in Saginaw to provide more details about the plan, said Matthew Schneider, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. “We are thankful to Dow and the trustees for their work in reaching this excellent result, which will benefit the residents of the Saginaw Bay area and the wildlife and waterfowl that inhabit it,” Schneider said.

 Jul 30, 2019 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Gov. Tony Evers on Monday created a new position in state government to coordinate Wisconsin’s efforts at combatting lead in drinking water, the same day he joined with other Great Lakes governors to promote healthier water supplies. Evers signed an executive order in Kenosha creating the lead pollution czar within the state Department of Health Services. No one was immediately named to the post. Evers created the job the same day he and four other governors in the Great Lakes region urged candidates in next year’s presidential election to support a plan for safeguarding their shared waters by boosting federal spending on treatment plants and environmental cleanups. Evers has declared 2019 the year of clean drinking water. While lead in Milwaukee’s water supply has gotten a lot of attention, Evers said every Wisconsin community is threatened. “The Department of Health Services has identified lead-poisoned children in every single county in Wisconsin,” Evers said in a statement. “We know that it will take a collaborative effort to ensure that everyone is able to drink clean water from their tap.” Under his order, all state agencies are being charged to work together with the new lead pollution czar to address what Evers is calling “Wisconsin’s lead crisis.” Since 1996, more than 220,000 children across Wisconsin have been identified as having a dangerous amount of lead in their body, according to studies by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. It is estimated that more than 176,000 lead service lines across the state are providing contaminated drinking water to homes and businesses. Creating the new position won praise from environmentalists who have been pressuring policy makers to act on lead issues for years. Republicans who control the Legislature balked earlier this year at an Evers plan to spend $40 million to replace lead service lines, because they feared too much of the money would go toward Milwaukee. “Unfortunately — and inaccurately — some politicians have used children’s health as a way to polarize voters,” said Wisconsin Conservation Voters executive director Kerry Schumann. “The truth is, lead exposure via drinking water is a serious problem in rural, suburban, and urban communities across the state.” Schumann said creating the lead pollution coordinator will allow the state to begin addressing the problem in a comprehensive way.

 Jul 15, 2019 HOUGHTON – The Torch Lake Public Action Council will host a statewide Public Advisory Council meeting in Houghton on Tuesday and Wednesday. Sessions are scheduled from 8:30 a.m. until noon both days at Michigan Technological University’s Great Lakes Research Center in Room 202. In addition, there will be a tour of Torch Lake on Tuesday after the end of the morning session. The Michigan Office of Great Lakes staff who assist the SPAC will be in attendance to update the council on state and federal actions that affect progress of cleanups in the Great Lakes. Areas of Concern are highly polluted sites on bodies of water that pose a danger to their communities. There were originally 14 Areas of Concern in Michigan. The pollution problems of AOCs are specifically identified as Beneficial Use Impairment for each AOC. According to the Upper Peninsula Environmental Coalition, the role of a public advisory council is to identify the problems, do community outreach and develop a network of government and non-governmental groups to address the concerns of communities. Torch Lake has recently been active in seeking solutions to the stamp sands dumped into the lake by former mining companies. The pollution has made it difficult to have a healthy benthos, or aquatic life, due to the spread of sands throughout the bottom of the lake. New efforts are underway to revive Torch Lake’s benthos that could lead to a major cleanup within the next decade. Along with the work being done by the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy Remediation Division to remove toxic chemicals along the west shore of Torch Lake, funding is being sought from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to find ways to repair the damage created by copper mining companies since the latter part of the 19th century. The public is invited to the SPAC meeting on both days to hear about progress being made by advisory councils across the state. The OGL and the Great Lakes Commission will update council members on state, federal and international activities. Research currently being done at the University of Michigan and Michigan Technological University will also inform council members of effective ways to engage their communities. The Keweenaw Bay Indian Community will have its president, Chris Swartz, explain the importance of Torch Lake to their community under their treaty rights and the work they have done to improve water quality on their reservation. SPAC meetings are an opportunity for members to network and to find out not only what concerns an AOC has, but also to see the host community and its attractions.

 Jun 28, 2019 MILWAUKEE (AP) — The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Canada-based Enbridge Energy doesn’t need to carry additional insurance for a pipeline project in Dane County, despite the local government’s insistence that it do so in case of an accidental spill. Dane County officials made a $25 million environmental liability policy a requirement for Enbridge’s permit for a project to triple the flow of crude oil from its Line 61 pipeline to 1.2 million barrels per day. The pipeline runs from northern Wisconsin to Illinois. The Court’s conservative majority ruled in favor of Enbridge 4-1, with two liberal justices abstaining. Dane County approved the permit in 2015 with the insurance requirement. In asking for additional insurance, Dane County officials cited the 2010 Enbridge oil spill in southwest Michigan that cost $1.2 billion and has resulted in ongoing insurance litigation. In that case, the U.S. government fined Enbridge more than $1.8 million after accusing the company of missing deadlines for pipeline inspections following the gigantic oil spill that polluted nearly 40 miles of the Kalamazoo River, shorelines and wetlands. Cleanup lasted four years. Enbridge appealed Dane County’s insurance requirement, but Wisconsin lawmakers intervened before the company’s challenge was decided, passing a last-minute provision in the state budget that blocked municipalities from imposing additional liability requirements when a pipeline operator already carries comprehensive insurance. Dane County required the extra insurance anyway, prompting Enbridge to appeal at the circuit court level, where they won, only to have an appeals court decide that Enbridge hadn’t proven it carried enough insurance. The high court reversed that Thursday, writing that Enbridge already had sufficient insurance. “Enbridge is pleased with the decision of the Supreme Court to uphold the Dane County Circuit Court’s decision to strike unenforceable insurance requirements from the (conditional use permit),” Enbridge spokeswoman Jennifer Smith said in a statement. While the court battle played out, Enbridge finished its $1.5 billion upgrade to its pipeline and built the needed pumping station, since state lawmakers made Dane County’s requirement unenforceable. “The Waterloo pump station is critical infrastructure for the state of Wisconsin and for the region, helping to ensure a reliable source of energy for decades to come,” Smith said. Enbridge has said that it has $860 million worth of general liability insurance that includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution, but the county and landowners involved in the case say the company hasn’t provided sufficient proof. An attorney for Dane County, David Gault, called the court’s ruling “primarily the result of an ill-conceived and poorly worded special interest statute.” Patricia Hammel, one of the attorneys representing the landowners, said in a statement that the court’s “decision allows Enbridge to operate the largest tar sands pipeline in the U.S across Wisconsin without adequate insurance and exposes our people, land and water to the consequences of a catastrophic spill.” In ruling in favor of Enbridge, the conservative justices concluded that lawmakers “rendered Dane County’s extra insurance conditions unenforceable, and the proper remedy is to strike the illegal conditions.” Dissenting from the majority, Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, echoed the arguments from landowners and the county, saying that Enbridge has not shown that it carries the needed insurance that would make what the county is asking for moot. Enbridge has disputed that claim. Enbridge, which operates Line 3 in Minnesota, is going through a legal battle there as well as it tries to replace the aging crude oil pipeline that runs through the northern part of the state. Earlier this month, two state agencies said they would hold up approval of the project’s permits until problems with its environmental review are resolved.

 Jun 12, 2019 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Republicans on the Legislature’s budget-writing committee approved money Tuesday to begin building a new prison in Green Bay but eliminated funding to construct new state facilities to house juvenile offenders after Wisconsin’s troubled youth prison closes, shifting those dollars to counties and raising questions about the state’s role in housing young offenders. The committee made the moves as it nears completion on revisions to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ state budget. The panel expects to wrap up its work Thursday by inserting tax cuts in the spending plan. The budget will then go to the full Legislature. Evers’ budget called for spending $2.5 billion on construction projects around the state. Republican committee members dumped that plan Tuesday evening, voting instead to spend about $1.9 billion. The GOP plan sets out $5 million to purchase land and start the bidding process to build a new prison to replace the aging Green Bay Correctional Institution. Evers’ construction budget didn’t include any plans for a new prison, but Republicans have been pushing for a new facility in Green Bay for months. The Republican plan also makes dramatic changes to bipartisan plans to close the youth prison outside Irma. The prison has been plagued by allegations of guard-on-prisoner abuse for years. An FBI investigation ended this past April with no criminal charges, but the prison has been at the center of multiple lawsuits, including one that resulted in a federal judge ordering sweeping reductions in the use of pepper spray, solitary confinement and shackles. The Legislature last year unanimously passed a bill requiring the Department of Corrections to close the facility by January 2021. The bill authorized $25 million in borrowing to build regional state juvenile detention facilities, $15 million in borrowing to expand the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center and $40 million in borrowing to fund grants for counties to build their own juvenile detention centers. Evers has said the Department of Corrections can’t get the replacement facilities built before 2021. His construction budget included an additional $194 million for the facilities. Republicans on the committee walked that back dramatically Tuesday, setting out only $44 million for the Mendota expansion. They also shifted all borrowing authority laid out in the 2018 bill for state facilities to the counties. The move left state Rep. Evan Goyke, a Democratic finance committee member who co-sponsored the closure bill, flabbergasted. “What do you want? Another study? What are you waiting for? You think we won’t need a facility for juveniles at all? Is that what you’re saying?” he said. “Look, the plan passed unanimously a year ago. This (plan) presses pause.” Republicans didn’t offer a direct explanation for the move. Republican Rep. Mark Born said he understands Goyle’s concerns but the state facilities are still in the pipeline and corrections officials can continue to work on them. Evers’ budget would have supplied $1.1 billion in additional funding for University of Wisconsin System building projects. Republicans on Tuesday scaled that back to about $1 billion. They earmarked $31.7 million for classroom renovations, down from the $38 million Evers proposed, but retained his plans to spend $125 million on Camp Randall Stadium and Kohl Center upgrades. The only UW projects that received no money under the Republican plan were plans to finish work on a new science hall and upgrade dorms at UW-La Crosse. In other action Tuesday the panel approved Evers’ proposal to extend the Department of Natural Resources’ stewardship program through mid-2022. The DNR uses borrowing authority under the program to purchase land for preservation and recreation. The committee, however, scrapped the governor’s plan to raise factory farms’ pollution permit fees from $345 to $660 and impose a new $3,270 fee on the farms payable every five years. The committee is now all but finished with its revisions to the budget. The panel plans to reconvene Thursday morning to insert the tax cuts into the spending plan. Republicans are eying a roughly $400 million middle class income tax cut but have not released details about how it would be paid for or what it would mean for the average taxpayer. The budget committee planned to vote on that Thursday. Evers and Republicans have been at odds since even before the governor took office. Republicans called a lame-duck session to weaken his powers, and neither side has shown a willingness to give on any significant items in the budget. Evers has powerful partial veto powers, which he can use to craft the Republican-approved budget into something more palatable to Democrats. But he also hasn’t ruled out vetoing the entire budget, which would require both sides to start from scratch. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos warned Evers on Tuesday that if he vetoes the entire budget the GOP will simply reduce spending on health and transportation in subsequent proposals. Republicans wouldn’t take any budget-related action in the summer, waiting instead until October to attempt override votes. Republicans would need to convince Democrats to vote with them to be able to override any veto. Wisconsin’s current budget runs through June 30. If there is no deal enacted by July 1, there would not be a government shutdown like occurred at the federal level and in other states. Instead, in Wisconsin current funding levels continue until there is a new budget enacted. MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Gov.

 May 29, 2019 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Legislature’s Republican-controlled budget committee voted Tuesday to continue a University of Wisconsin tuition freeze for another two years and give the system about $58 million in additional state money, less than half as much as Democratic Gov. Tony Evers wanted and funding that comes with a catch. Evers had called for nearly a $127 million increase in state funding for the university, money that Democrats said was needed to help deal with budget cuts under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker and address high-need areas like nursing and high-tech jobs. But they didn’t have the votes to overcome Republican support for a smaller increase, $45 million of which will only be turned over if the Legislature approves UW’s plan for spending it. UW President Ray Cross said after the vote he felt like he had been “kicked in the shins.” Cross said it would take $60 million just to keep pace with inflation and called the committee’s decision “kind of shocking” and “very short sighted.” “I’m really frustrated and disappointed,” Cross said. But Republican committee co-chair Rep. John Nygren, of Marinette, defended the smaller increase, saying “There will always be a desire from some to spend more.” The panel is working to complete revisions to the Evers budget before sending it to the full Legislature for consideration, likely in June. Democrats don’t have the votes to stop what Republicans approve, but Evers does have the power to make changes with his broad veto power. The tuition freeze began under Walker and is now in its sixth year. Evers proposed extending it for two more, but asked for $50.4 million to pay for it. Republicans rejected that request to pay for it. The committee also rejected Evers proposals to give UW $45 million to attract and retain students in high-demand areas and spend $10 million to pay for a program that would establish fellowships and loan programs for nursing students who commit to teach for three years in the university’s nursing program, a move to address teaching shortfalls. “The Legislature missed an opportunity to meet the future needs of the state,” Cross said. In the area of natural resources, Republicans approved creating two new scientist positions at the Department of Natural Resources, less than the five Evers wanted. Evers wanted to restore five of 18 research scientist positions cut by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature in 2015. The cuts were done to stop the department from studying climate change and the impact of mining on pollution as Walker and legislative Republicans were trying to lure a mining company to the state. The two new positions Republicans approved would be charged with researching water pollution, particularly from polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Those are man-made chemicals are contaminants involved in a variety of industrial and consumer products, including fast-food wrappers and stain-resistant sprays. Contamination from PFAS has been documented in over 170 sites in 40 states, including Wisconsin. But the state DNR said it can’t engage in research or provide information about PFAS contamination in the state without additional staff. Democrats have introduced a bill calling on the DNR to set standards for the contaminant in drinking water, groundwater, surface water, air and soil, and to establish monitoring requirements. Republicans have a more limited bill dealing only with limiting the use of PFAS in firefighting foam. The budget committee approved spending $200,000 on determining the extent and locations of PFAS contamination in Wisconsin. The committee also voted to: — Increase by $4 million the amount of borrowing authority to pay for cleaning up contaminated sediment from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan and their tributaries. That is $21 million less than Evers wanted. — increase reimbursement rates for private attorneys who offer public defender services from $40 to $70 per hour by 2020, a move designed to address a shortage of attorneys willing to take the cases. Wisconsin’s reimbursement rate, which hasn’t changed since 1995, is the lowest in the country. — raise the salaries of public defenders and prosecutors by 2% each of the next two years, in line with what other state employees receive. — add 34 assistant district attorney positions across the state.

url: https://www.miningjournal.net/opinion/2019/08/heres-the-true-dope-on-clothes-pollution/
 Aug 2, 2019 Do you worry that the clothes you buy pose an environmental hazard? The idea never crossed my mind until serious news sources started talking about it. The central claim was that the fashion industry is the world’s second biggest source of pollution, the first being oil. The story circulated so widely because few of us imagine that our T-shirts and track shoes could be hurting the environment big time. We’ll get to the scientific consensus on its accuracy shortly. But one of more fascinating aspects is how this No. 2-polluter rap against clothes began. No one seems to know. It seems to have become a “truth” through the magic of internet laundering. Fashion websites bounced the story back and forth, providing links to supposedly authoritative voices. And where did their links lead? To one another. Passed around enough, the idea that clothes are the second biggest polluter became a “fact.” Fashion designer Eileen Fisher, known for her environmentalism, got sucked in. She began making a big thing of clothes pollution, citing the above assertion. When asked for her source of information, she referred to websites that referred to other websites. And she quoted the 2015 documentary about the fashion industry “The True Cost,” which turned out to be not as dependable a font of knowledge as one might believe. The documentary-maker said he found the claim through people running the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, a respected conference on sustainability. The fashion summit people said they believed it came from a report by the Deloitte consulting firm. Guess what. No one can find the report. When professional journalists jumped on the matter, they swatted away some of the more exaggerated assertions. The global clothing industry is not the No. 2 offender, they concluded, but it is highly dirty. What makes it polluting? Here are some of the factors: ≤ Nearly 60 percent of all clothing is discarded within a year of being made. This astonishing revelation is not a reflection of flighty consumer behavior. It’s not that you and I throw out 60 percent of the new clothes we buy. Rather, it’s that mass producers get rid of wares that don’t leave the racks right away. The fast fashion retailer H&M, for one, reported last year that it had $4.3 billion of unsold merchandise and had started incinerating it to provide energy. Fast fashion is definitely a villain here. Its business model relies on women buying lots of clothes at low prices, wearing them a few times and then throwing them out or giving them away. No one has to go naked, but the environmentally conscientious know not to run wild at Target and H&M. ≤ Up to 25 percent of the world’s chemical compounds are used in textile dying and finishing. Fashion plays a big part here, but bear in mind that textiles are not just clothes. They are bedsheets, curtains, napkins, upholstery and toys. ≤ About 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are produced by the clothing and footwear industries. This came from the United Nations secretariat on climate change. The reasons are long supply chains and energy-intensive production. How polluting your clothes consumption is depends, of course, on how many clothes you buy and how long you wear them. “Sustainable fashion” is an interesting concept, because it can include sturdy, inexpensive jeans or high-priced designer clothes. What’s most important is that the clothes don’t have to be replaced often. One last amazing statistic that seems to have stuck: Over the past two decades, Americans have doubled the amount of clothing they discard every year. It’s now about 80 pounds a person. Is that possible? Don’t look at me. Editor’s note: Follow Froma Harrop on Twitter @FromaHarrop. She can be reached at fharrop@gmail.com.

 Jun 9, 2019 MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Wisconsin company failed to report the release of hazardous materials at a property in Marinette that resulted in some residents unknowingly drinking contaminated water for years, the state Department of Natural Resources said. The DNR has referred the matter to the state Department of Justice for civil prosecution, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The agency alleges that a unit of Glendale-based Johnson Controls failed to inform state officials that it knew that so-called forever chemicals had been found at a fire training facility in northeastern Wisconsin and did not take steps to minimize their impact. Johnson Controls said in a statement Friday that it believed the contamination was confined to its property and that it wasn’t obligated to notify authorities when the chemicals were first detected. Johnson Controls’ Tyco Fire Products uses the perfluorinated chemicals in the manufacture of fire retardants. For decades, the compounds have been an essential ingredient in firefighting chemicals and have been used at its training site on the edge of town. The chemicals resist breaking down in the environment and have been discovered in private wells in the Marinette area. They also have been found in trace levels in the municipal water system, and they have turned up in local streams and offshore in Green Bay. Epidemiology studies that were cited in a federal report last year suggested that the compounds can lead to increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, liver damage, thyroid disease, asthma, decreased fertility, some cancers and a drop in responses to vaccines. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in February that state records showed that Tyco had test results of soil and well contamination from the chemicals on its property dating back to October 2013 as part an effort to remove long-standing gasoline compounds from the property. In November 2017, Tyco reported that it believed the chemicals had spread outside its 380-acre fire technology center, where testing and training have gone on since at least 1962. The following month, the company began distributing bottled water to residents whose private wells might have been affected. Tyco and Johnson Controls are currently providing bottled water to 125 residents. The companies have installed 38 water treatment systems on properties. Douglas Oitzinger, a former mayor of Marinette, said Tyco should have responded quicker. “If you have a forest fire going on your property, you don’t assume that it’s not going to jump to the neighbors’ property and you don’t report it,” Oitzinger said. The pollution problems first came to light under the industry-friendly administration of Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who was replaced in January by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.

url: https://www.miningjournal.net/life/tuesday-health/2019/03/plastic-pollution-impacts-health/
 Mar 19, 2019 When people are asked to think about the word “health”, thoughts automatically turn inward. They think of their heart or their joints, liver or lungs, associating health with the internal environment, our “innards”, all those organs and vessels. But the external world is a critical component of health. Our environment has an obvious effect on our health, especially when toxins are present. A source of these poisonous substances not often considered is that of the seafood consumed by so many. Recent investigations have shown that humans are being exposed to, and potentially affected by, plastics that have become part of the marine food chain. Only recently has plastic pollution in the oceans become a real concern amongst governments, public service groups, and the general public. In 2013, Americans produced 254 million tons of trash. It works out to roughly four and a half pounds of solid waste produced per person per day, at least in the U.S. Plastics represent approximately ten percent of this mass. Plastics have become an integral part of human society in this age of man. Remember the Stone Age? This may be the Plastic Age. They are certainly important in health care. Some particular benefits in medicine have been their versatility in combination with low cost. This has allowed for mass production and single-use products, clearly more hygienic, disease-preventing. Needless to say, the importance of plastics to society at large is tremendous Plastic, although invented in 1907, went into real production in the sixties. At this point, Americans are producing more plastic trash than ever, and only a small percentage is recycled. Most of the plastic in our oceans came from the land. And there is a lot of it. Over the last few decades, mankind has managed to dump many tons of garbage into the oceans. The total amount of plastics produced in the world in the first decade of this century is equivalent to the total world production in the entire century before. Plastic is everywhere, ubiquitous, nearly omnipresent. And because we want these materials to hold up, they don’t break down. This is a critical part of this topic: plastic’s longevity. It takes thousands of years to decay. Unfortunately, plastics, over time, typically leach out the toxic substances they are composed of. These products are known to persist, polluting the environment for decades, centuries, even millennia. Some end up in landfills. When this happens to plastics, it interacts with water and forms dangerous chemicals. These chemicals can seep underground, thus degrading the water quality. Marine life and wildlife are becoming poisoned, with these toxins entering the food chain. Invariably, this will mean human consumption, threatening human health. In the most polluted places in the ocean, the mass of plastic exceeds the amount of plankton six times over. The largest of these, The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is located in the North Pacific Ocean and is larger than the state of Texas, although similar garbage patches can be found in the Indian and Atlantic Ocean. These islands form as the currents carry the plastic, collecting where the currents meet. Plastics reach the ocean by being blown into the water, picked up by tides, or dumped off platforms and ships. There they gradually break down into ever-smaller pieces termed micro-plastics, due to the action of sunlight exposure, oxidation, the physical action of waves and ocean life. These micro-plastic pieces are recognized to be the most abundant type of plastic in our oceans. Microplastics can now be found almost everywhere looked for, from the beaches and shore-lines to the open ocean, in varying concentrations. If the formation of these micro-plastics wasn’t enough, studies have revealed plastic tends to take up certain persistent, toxic substances present in trace quantities in almost all bodies of water. Consequently, the components of plastics, as well as the chemicals they absorb, can be consumed or taken up by sea life of all sorts. How concerned should we be about marine plastics as far as human health goes? Owing to the many additives contained therein, plastics pose a number of potential human health and environmental risks. Certain components of plastic will affect the human endocrine system, wherein any level of exposure, no matter the route, may be potentially harmful. Of principal concern are hormone-disrupting properties, some of which cause problems with fertility. We need to know whether consumption of plastic debris by marine organisms translates into toxic exposures for people who eat seafood. One question that can’t yet be answered concerns the toxicity of the microplastic particles themselves. Even without considering the chemicals taken up by plastic, these particles can induce abnormal immune system responses, alter gene expression, and cause cell death, amongst other adverse effects. They can pass through the placenta and the blood-brain barrier and can be taken up by the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. And we do not yet have a test that measures human tissues for microplastics. Those plastic components of known adverse health and ecological effects should be removed from the manufacturing process. Some examples include BPA found in polycarbonate food containers and DEHP from medical equipment. The lack of biodegradability, even when considered safe from a toxicological perspective, also demands change. The next-generation of substances will be carbon-neutral monomers that are nontoxic and will be degradable at a rate sufficient to prevent the ongoing accumulation of plastic debris in terrestrial and aquatic environments. We can’t yet say how much plastic, in all its varied forms, is in the ocean. The studies performed to date aren’t able to tell us. We do know that plastic has become almost omni-present on our planet. It has been found on the most remote beaches, collected to form these floating islands, and has been discovered in the bodies of all manner of living creatures, from fish to birds to whales. We do know enough to say it is contributing to the on-going, persistent accumulation of toxic substances in the human diet. The continued production of these durable materials, of limited recyclability, for use as short-lived consumer products is unsustainable. The earth is a closed system. To a single individual, it seems immeasurable, without boundaries. But at this point in human development, we know otherwise. The human population has continued to increase, climbing irrevocably towards eight billion people, nine billion predictable. Can our planet support these numbers, or will we poison ourselves in the process? Typically, the common response to questions of this sort center around the notion technology will save us. Some new invention, or radical new process will enable us to survive and thrive. But with the increasing production and discharge of these substances into this closed system, at some point, past or future, these enduring materials will impact human health. This is in addition to the documented ecological effects. These are substances the human body is not equipped to deal with. What consequences will there be as they filter through the complex system which is Earth’s ecology. Will we see a decrease in fertility or an increase in cancer rates as a result? Or are we already? Many scientists, along with many of the general public are demanding the development of smarter and safer materials for future use. We need to create the next generation of plastics, making them more biodegradable, with a markedly shorter half-life. This will means they won’t accumulate in the oceans, along with less absorption of toxic chemicals. We can’t shield people from all possible exposures, but perhaps we can produce safer chemicals. Hopefully the environment and our health won’t suffer too much in the meantime.

 Apr 22, 2018 In this 2015 photo, Jenna Jambeck, an environment engineering professor at the University of Georgia, holds a plastic baggie with trash collected last fall from a clean up at Panama Beach, Fla., at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in San Jose, Calif. Jambeck calculates that nearly 9 million tons end up in the world’s oceans and on the coastlines each year, as of 2010, according to her 2015 study. (AP photo) By SETH BORENSTEIN AP Science Writer WASHINGTON — Cities and nations are looking at banning plastic straws and stirrers in hopes of addressing the world’s plastic pollution problem. The problem is so large, though, that scientists say that’s not nearly enough. Australian scientists Denise Hardesty and Chris Wilcox estimate, using trash collected on U.S. coastlines during cleanups over five years, that there are nearly 7.5 million plastic straws lying around America’s shorelines. They figure that means 437 million to 8.3 billion plastic straws are on the entire world’s coastlines. But that huge number suddenly seems small when you look at all the plastic trash bobbing around oceans. University of Georgia environmental engineering professor Jenna Jambeck calculates that nearly 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) end up in the world’s oceans and coastlines each year, as of 2010, according to her 2015 study in the journal Science . That’s just in and near oceans. Each year more than 35 million tons (31.9 million metric tons) of plastic pollution are produced around Earth and about a quarter of that ends up around the water. “For every pound of tuna we’re taking out of the ocean, we’re putting two pounds of plastic in the ocean,” says ocean scientist Sherry Lippiatt, California regional coordinator for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s marine debris program. Seabirds can ingest as much as 8 percent of their body weight in plastic, which for humans “is equivalent to the average woman having the weight of two babies in her stomach,” says Hardesty of Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Organizers of Earth Day, which is today, have proclaimed ending plastics pollution this year’s theme. And following in the footsteps of several U.S. cities such as Seattle and Miami Beach, British Prime Minister Theresa May in April called on the nations of the British commonwealth to consider banning plastic straws, coffee stirrers and plastic swabs with cotton on the end. McDonald’s will test paper straws in some U.K. locations next month and keep all straws behind the counter, so customers have to ask for them. “Together with our customers we can do our bit for the environment and use fewer straws,” says Paul Pomroy, who runs the fast-food company’s U.K. business. The issue of straws and marine animals got more heated after a 2015 viral video showing rescuers removing a straw from a sea turtle’s nose in graphic and bloody detail. But a ban may be a bit of a straw man in the discussions about plastics pollution. Straws make up about 4 percent of the plastic trash by piece, but far less by weight. Straws on average weigh so little — about one sixty-seventh of an ounce or .42 grams — that all those billions of straws add up to only about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9 million tons of plastic waste that yearly hits the waters. “Bans can play a role,” says oceanographer Kara Lavendar Law, a co-author with Jambeck of the 2015 Science study. “We are not going to solve the problem by banning straws.” Scientists say that unless you are disabled or a small child, plastic straws are generally unnecessary and a ban is start and good symbol.

 Sep 11, 2017 PLAINFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — A Superfund landfill suspected of chemically polluting a Michigan water system once accepted toxic sludge from a leather tannery that used the same chemical compounds, according to state records and a former truck driver. Sand Lake resident Earl Tefft told MLive that he regularly drove sludge waste from the Wolverine World Wide tannery to the State Disposal Landfill from 1965 to 1966, while hauling for a local pickup service. Kent County records also state that the company dumped sludge at the landfill during the same period. But the company, in a statement, said that “based on a review of available records, Wolverine does not believe it disposed of material” at the landfill. Wolverine made the Hush Puppies shoe brand using Scotchgard, a stain-and-water repellant that relies on perfluorinated chemicals as its chemical backbone. Those compounds were found in Plainfield Township water in 2013. The water system serves about 40,000 customers. “We’re tracking the (chemicals) from State Disposal to see if it’s the only source, or a source in the Plainfield Township wells,” said Judith Alfano, site manager with the Superfund section at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. Alfano didn’t directly point to Wolverine as the source of the chemicals, which the department determined are moving through groundwater toward five township wells at Versluis Park next to the Grand River. Perfluorinated chemicals are no longer manufactured in the U.S. because of health risks. Studies show exposure has been tied to liver disease, thyroid malfunction, pediatric developmental problems and other endocrine and immune system impacts.

 Jul 21, 2015 WILLIS, Mich. (AP) – Two members of Congress from Michigan plan to introduce legislation encouraging Great Lakes states to develop programs that reduce risk of pollution that causes harmful algae blooms. Reps. Tim Walberg of Tipton and Candice Miller of Shelby Township in Macomb County will announce their bill today at a news conference near Willis. It calls for initiatives modeled after the Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program, which helps farmers voluntarily take conservation measures such as reducing soil erosion and nutrient runoff. Ohio has banned farmers in the northwestern part of the state from spreading manure on frozen and rain-soaked fields and requires them to get training before using commercial fertilizers. Those regulations were adopted in response to algae outbreaks that contaminated drinking water in Toledo and southeastern Michigan last August.

 Mar 2, 2014 TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. – Sharp cutbacks in phosphorus runoff into Lake Erie are needed to counter a worsening problem of algae blooms that degrade water quality, harm fish and chase away tourists, a U.S.-Canadian agency said in a report to both governments Thursday. The International Joint Commission, which recommends policies dealing with the Great Lakes and other border waterways, recommended targets for lowering daily amounts of phosphorus flowing into the ailing Erie. It’s the smallest of the five lakes yet has the most abundant fish population and supports a billion-dollar angling and boating industry. The commission said the level must drop by 46 percent to shrink by half a “dead zone” where algae saps so much oxygen that fish can’t survive. It called for a 39 percent decrease on the western side of the lake where algae blooms have been particularly widespread. Phosphorus, a nutrient that feeds algae, was among pollutants that had so degraded Lake Erie by the 1970s that some declared it dead. The problem improved significantly with laws requiring steep reductions in phosphorus releases from wastewater treatment plants and factories. But it returned in the late 1990s and has steadily worsened. A bloom in summer of 2011 was the largest on record, coating a 1,930-square-mile surface area with greenish slime. The algae is poisonous enough to kill animals and make people sick. An Ohio township last year ordered residents not to drink tap water for two days because of algae pollution, while Toledo and other cities have tested and treated their supplies. When the algae dies, foul rotting mats wash onto beaches or sink to the bottom, robbing the water – and fish – of oxygen. The report largely blames the algae’s resurgence on manure and chemical fertilizer from farms, along with urban sources such as lawn fertilizers, pet droppings, leaky septic tanks and storm water drains. It proposes designating the lake as an impaired waterway under the federal Clean Water Act to force phosphorus limits. “It’s time for governments at all levels to put the lake on a diet by setting targets and achieving real reductions,” said Lana Pollack, chairwoman of the commission’s U.S. section. The reduction targets should be met by 2022, the report said. Overall levels have not risen since the mid-1990s, according to the report, based on two years of study by more than 60 scientists with universities, private firms and government agencies. But a type called dissolved reactive phosphorus, or DRP, has more than doubled – and it’s the variety “most easily used by the algae for growth,” said Don Scavia, director of the University of Michigan’s Graham Sustainability Institute. DRP chemical fertilizers are popular for producing corn used as animal feed on large industrial farms, Scavia said. Manure also can undergo a process that generates DRP. In the past couple of decades, farmers increasingly have applied both in fall and winter, when the material sometimes has remained atop frozen ground or snow instead of soaking in. Farmers also have done less tilling. ISHPEMING — All activities at the Ishpeming Multi-Purpose Senior Center have been suspended until April 6, ...

 Mar 13, 2013 Looking for an example of a bureaucracy trying to fix one problem and generating another? Try looking beneath the waves of western Lake Superior. A total of 22 barrels holding military ammunition, originally dumped into Lake Superior decades ago and recovered just last year, have now been re-dumped because a Wisconsin American Indian tribe lacked a federal waiver to bring them ashore. This is a prime case of good intentions leading to foolish actions. Last summer, the barrels were raised from the bottom of the lake, where they have sat since being dumped off barges in the late 1950s and early 1960s as part of a secret military project. The taxpayer-funded project was part of a $3.3 million Department of Defense program aimed at cleaning up military pollution on Indian lands. The barrels are located outside of Duluth Harbor, about 50 miles from the The Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Reservation, and the band has treaty authority to help manage natural resources on the lake. When they were raised, the barrels were found to contain thousands of tiny firecracker-sized explosive devices. Officials are worried about a chain reaction setting the barrels off. So getting these potentially harmful barrels off the bottom of Lake Superior must have been a good thing, right? No. Apparently the barrels were not allowed to be brought ashore at all because there are no federally approved facilities to receive explosives on the Great Lakes. So the tribe and the contractor who pulled the barrels up said they were left with no choice but to sink them again. The explosive devices were taken out of the original 55-gallon drums, put into new containers and dumped back into Superior, with the site marked by GPS. The tribe and the contractor hope to get federal waivers to retrieve the containers – again – soon. The whole exercise seems a colossal misuse of time and money. And the bureaucratic mess doesn’t end there. The tribe apparently transported three barrels, which it said fell below the threshhold of hazardous material, to a disposal facility in Sheboygan, Wis. That move sparked an investigation by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, trying to determine whether the barrels were moved without proper permits or notification. With an estimated 1,400 barrels of military waste still in rusting barrels at the bottom of the lake, we think regulatory agencies should focus on the cleanup rather than on forcing pollution back into the lake. A study of whether raising these barrels or allowing them to sink into the sediment would be better for the long term human and ecological health of the area is being undertaken. That report is due by September. We hope it offers a clear path forward for cleaning up this site. Beyond that, we urge all agencies – state, federal and tribal – to get on the same page.

(Journal photo by Trinity Carey) A glass bottle is returned at a recycling station. In October, the MCSWMA will begin collecting glass to be processed and potentially used for mine backfill, an additive in concrete and asphalt and more. (Journal photo by Trinity Carey) MARQUETTE — According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 11.4 million tons of glass was generated in 2017, representing a total of 4.2% of all municipal solid waste generation. Just 3 million tons of that glass was recycled that year, while 6.9 million tons of glass were sent to landfills, making the glass recycling rate around 26.6%. To develop a sustainable and economical landfill facility and produce a range of glass products, the Marquette County Solid Waste Management Authority and professors from Michigan Tech will meet with state legislators and officials at 4 p.m. March 20, in the landfill boardroom to present proposed research on glass repurposing and to seek funding from the State of Michigan. State Rep. Sara Cambensy, D-Marquette; state Rep. Beau LaFave, R-Iron Mountain; state Sen. Ed McBroom, R-Vulcan; state Rep. Greg Markkanen, R-Houghton and others will be present. With the MCSWMA’s switch to single-stream recycling in October, will come its ability to receive and repurpose glass into various materials. The authority hopes to receive state funding so Tech can further pursue the proposed research and overall establish the efficacy of glass recycling into value-added products, the project overview states. “We’re probably looking at $1 million over that three-year period, so basically what we’ll be recommending to them is like $500,000 the first year, $300,000 or $400,000 the second year and either $100,000 or $200,000 the third year depending on how that works out,” said MCSWMA Board of Trustees Chairman Randy Yelle. “That’s our very first step and that has to happen before we can even consider taking region one (the Upper Peninsula) glass. If this goes into place, we will open up and take every bit of glass we can get from the whole U.P. and we’re centrally located.” A glass bottle is returned at a recycling station. In October, the MCSWMA will begin collecting glass to be processed and potentially used for mine backfill, an additive in concrete and asphalt and more. (Journal photo by Trinity Carey) The authority is “asking for funding from wherever,” said Bill Nordeen, legal counsel for the MCSWMA. “We want the state of Michigan to fund Michigan Tech’s research so they can go out and certify the different possibilities and we can get rid of our glass.” While asking for funding from wherever available, Nordeen has identified funds from the Michigan Deposit Bottle Law escheat, or the unclaimed deposits reverted to the state, that could be used to fund the research. “It turns out that when you and I and everybody else, we go and buy a 12-pack of beer at the store and we pay a deposit on those cans, some people don’t return their cans,” Nordeen said. “So say we throw them in the garbage what happens to all the dimes that we paid?” According to the Michigan Bottle Deposit Law, 75% of the money from unclaimed deposits is deposited into the Cleanup and Redevelopment Trust Fund and 25% is returned to retailers. Of the 75% deposited into the trust fund, 80% is deposited into the Cleanup and Redevelopment Fund and 10% is deposited into the Community Prevention and Pollution Fund. The other 10% remains in the trust fund. The $800,000 grant awarded to the MCSWMA from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy for the authority’s recycling project came from this fund. “Last year we went to the Legislature, to EGLE, and said: ‘Listen, what better way to spend the money on these items that were not turned back in, than on recycling, which is trying to keep these things from going to the landfill,” Nordeen said. “That was our last year’s pitch. Our pitch this year is: ‘What better way to spend it than to try to figure out what to do with the glass?’ Many of those deposits were glass bottles.” Documents from the authority and MTU note that glass is the most difficult material present in municipal solid waste to find a suitable market for. “To be economically feasible, recycled glass needs to be used in local markets or needs to be processed to a level where significant value-added results, which justifies higher transportation costs for both the source materials and the products. In the case of the new single-stream Material Recovery Facility being commissioned by the MCSWMA, located in Marquette, MI, the issues of transportation to potential markets is even more acute,” documents state. If granted funding, MTU plans to research the possible uses for repurposed glass, including: ≤ Mine backfill using coarse product: Once ore is extracted from a mine it is refilled with crushed rock derived from original tunnels drove into the mine. Other materials will eventually be needed, the research concept states, and crushed glass could be used in its place. ≤ Using the coarse glass product as aggregate: The concept noted that aggregate supply is a challenge nationwide, but recycled glass may be a viable alternative in asphalt or fill material. ≤ Using the fine glass product in concrete: The glass product could be used in portland cement concrete or the basic ingredient in concrete. ≤ Using the fine glass product as an abrasive: Glass is used as an abrasive in some industrial applications like sandblasting. The research of these possible applications has been broken down into five general areas of study to be conducted over a three-year time period. Tech will conduct an economic and sustainability assessment, geotechnical testing and research, asphalt testing and research, concrete testing and research and design of the required processing facility. Specific topics to be addressed throughout these areas of research include looking at the availability of glass in the waste stream serviced by the MCSWMA, testing the long term performance of glass in asphalt and concrete mixtures and more. Certification from MTU would make the glass processed by the MCSWMA more marketable to manufacturers, Yelle said. “We need the help from the community to participate in the recycling program and we need them to separate their glass from the single-stream. And the reason for that is if you’ve got them together, the glass will contaminate the paper and cardboard. And then we can’t get rid of them and they go to the landfill,” he said. Removing glass from the landfill will overall extend the life of the landfill which currently has just over 50 years of life. “The recycling program as projected will add 10 to 12 years per cell to the life of the landfill. There are currently five cells left,” Yelle said. “We could end up with 80, 100 years of life at the landfill. It all depends on the participation we get from the residents.” Yelle is hoping for the support of legislators at the meeting as he is confident once the research is conducted, markets would support the authority’s processing of glass. “We need the financial support to finish out this research,” Yelle said. “Glass, I mean, that takes up a lot of space.” Trinity Carey can be reached at 906-228-2500, ext. 206.

 Feb 29, 2020 To the Journal editor: In recent years, I have become increasingly aware of the increased use of plastics, as well as the negative impacts of plastic. It is used for packaging food, beverages, cleaning supplies, cosmetics and electronic(to name a few) as well as a component in our toys, cars, dishes, clothing, shoes etc. The list is seemingly endless. The problem is plastics do not biodegrade and contain many chemicals. Plastics pollute woods and waterways. They break into smaller and smaller pieces, and wild animals can become entangles in plastic or eat the pieces. I notice more and more plastic garbage on our Great Lakes beaches and in our woods. Some of our congressional members have identified this problem and introduced the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act [S.3263 in the Senate/H.R. 5845 in the House]. This bill works to reduce non-recyclable plastic items and encourage the improved recovery of recyclable plastic materials. This bill works to end the health threats of pollution from petrochemical plants on communities and tasks federal agencies to develop comprehensive plans to address plastic pollution in our waterways. This is a historic effort that will spur innovation and investments in the United States’ domestic recycling and composting infrastructure.

 Feb 28, 2020 TRAVERSE CITY (AP) — A Michigan oversight panel Thursday endorsed drinking water standards designed to limit exposure to a group of household and industrial chemicals linked to a variety of health problems. The proposed rules would apply to seven compounds in a category known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. They have been used for decades in products ranging from nonstick cookware to stain-resistant clothing and food containers, as well as foam used to extinguish jet-fuel fires. They’re known as “forever chemicals” because they persist indefinitely in the environment without breaking down. Members of Congress announced Thursday the Air Force would spend $13.5 million cleaning up PFAS water pollution near the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, Michigan. Thousands of PFAS compounds have been developed. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy crafted drinking water standards for just seven because they’re the only ones for which there is enough scientific data to justify regulation, spokesman Scott Dean said. Their acceptance by the Environmental Rules Review Committee was a key step. The state legislature established the panel in 2018 at the urging of Republicans who described it as a check on excessively burdensome regulation. Among its members are representatives of business and industry sectors including oil and gas, agriculture and manufacturing. At their urging, the panel delayed action on the PFAS rules last fall. But it approved the proposals Thursday on a 8-0 vote, with two members abstaining. The decision “shows there is broad support for rules that protect Michiganders from contaminants in their drinking water,” said Liesl Clark, director of the environment department. The rules still need approval of the legislature’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules before taking effect. They would cover about 2,700 drinking water systems, requiring them to conduct periodic testing and inform the public of results. The environment department forwarded its proposals to the oversight panel last October. The panel considered them in two meetings and took public feedback. While the overwhelming majority of written comments were supportive, some raised concern about the costs of meeting the standards or said the rules were put together too quickly. Smaller drinking water suppliers “don’t have the ability to pass that cost along on any non-painful way to ratepayers,” Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau, said during Thursday’s meeting in Lansing. John Dulmes, executive director of the Michigan Chemistry Council, said the department hadn’t provided enough scientific justification for some of the provisions. ST.

 Jan 11, 2020 MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich. (AP) — An industrial site in suburban Detroit from which a greenish stream of contaminated water leaked onto a freeway will be considered for the federal Superfund cleanup program, Michigan officials said Friday. The state Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said an evaluation of the Electro-Plating Services Inc. site will be completed this spring. It will be based on dozens of soil and water samples being taken by the department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The chrome plating company in Madison Heights was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste. An EPA cleanup removed toxic chemicals and contaminated liquids. The leak of bright green goo onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 last month prompted a new investigation. It found high levels of numerous toxins in soil and groundwater at the site, including hexavalent chromium, which is associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage. The Superfund program enables EPA to arrange cleanup of highly contaminated sites by requiring polluters to pay for the work or using government funds when responsible parties can’t be found. Michigan officials said Friday they also had detected high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, in water collected by a sump pump in the facility’s basement. PFAS are chemicals used in a wide variety of industrial and household products that have been linked to kidney and liver damage, thyroid disease, fertility problems and low birth weight. The Michigan agency said water sampled from the basement pit contained levels of one PFAS compound, known as PFOS, at a level of 742 parts per trillion, far exceeding Michigan’s groundwater standard of 70 ppt. The environmental department said the recovered water will be treated to remove the compounds and other pollution before disposal. ST.

 Jan 3, 2020 FILE - In this Oct. 12, 2018 file photo, water contaminated with arsenic, lead and zinc flows from a pipe out of the Lee Mountain mine and into a holding pond near Rimini, Mont. The community is part of the Upper Tenmile Creek Superfund site, where dozens of abandoned mines have left water supplies polluted and residents must use bottled water. The Trump administration has built up the largest backlog of unfunded toxic Superfund projects awaiting clean-up in at least 15 years, nearly tripling the number of sites where clean-ups are ready to go but awaiting money, according to 2019 figures quietly released by the Environmental Protection Agency over the winter holidays. (AP Photo/Matthew Brown) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has built up the biggest backlog of unfunded toxic Superfund clean-up projects in at least 15 years, nearly triple the number that were stalled for lack of money in the Obama era, according to 2019 figures quietly released by the Environmental Protection Agency over the winter holidays. The accumulation of Superfund projects that are ready to go except for money comes as the Trump administration routinely proposes funding cuts for Superfund and for the EPA in general. The four-decade-old Superfund program is meant to tackle some of the most heavily contaminated sites in the U.S. and Trump has declared it a priority even while seeking to shrink its budget. “There hasn’t been a sense of urgency,” said Violet Donoghue, who has lived for 31 years on Bon Brae Street in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. Toxic PCBs have poisoned some local soil, water and fish at nearby Lake St. Clair, and the neighborhood is one of the 34 Superfund sites where clean-up projects languished for lack of money in 2019. “I feel many people have been harmed, but that’s only my opinion,” Donoghue said. She said the last word from the EPA was that soil would be removed from the front of her house. “Now when they say they’re cleaning it, I say, ‘OK, give me the date,'” she said. The unfunded projects are in 17 states and Puerto Rico. They range from abandoned mines that discharged heavy metals and arsenic in the West to an old wood pulp site in Mississippi and a defunct dry cleaner that released toxic solvents in North Carolina. Congress created the Superfund program in 1980 after the Love Canal episode and other notorious pollution cases. Its intent is to hold polluters responsible for cleanup costs or provide taxpayer money when no responsible party can be identified. Trump “is focused on putting Americans first,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told a Senate environment committee early 2019. “There may be no better example than our success in the Superfund program.” “We are in the process of cleaning up some of the nation’s largest, most complex sites and returning them to productive use,” Wheeler said then. But two former EPA officials whose work dealt with Superfund oversight said the growing backlog of stalled Superfund projects under the Trump administration, and steady or ebbing numbers of clean-up construction projects completed, point to a different picture. “They’re misleading Congress and the public about the funds that are needed to really protect the public from exposure to the toxic chemicals,” said Elizabeth Southerland, who worked for 30 years at EPA, including as director of science and technology in the water office, before retiring in 2017. “It’s detrimental.” This is a “regulatory failure,” said Judith Enck, who served as the EPA’s regional northeastern U.S. administrator under President Barack Obama. Given the growing numbers of unfunded clean-up projects, “EPA should be knocking on the door of Congress and saying, give us more money to deal with the sites,” Enck said. Asked what the EPA spent money on instead, and why the agency didn’t ask Congress for more to deal with the growing backlog, EPA spokeswoman Maggie Sauerhage offered few specifics Thursday. ST.

 Dec 31, 2019 This photo provided by Michigan Department of Transportation toxic chemical substances leaked along Interstate 696 in Madison Heights, Mich., on Dec. 20, 2019. The discovery led to an investigation of an old industrial site near the interstate. State regulators said high levels of multiple contaminants have been found in soil and groundwater around the former Electro-Plating Services. (Michigan Department of Transportation via AP) LANSING, Mich. — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday ordered Michigan’s environmental agency to review its pollution-inspection procedures after the discovery of a bright green substance along the shoulder of a major interstate in suburban Detroit. Whitmer called the ooze — groundwater contaminated by industrial waste from Electro-Plating Services in Madison Heights — “very concerning” and said it shows the need for “broad reforms” to address underfunding and understaffing at the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy following eight years of one-party control in Lansing. The Democrat urged the Republican-led Legislature to help better fund the agency and to pass stalled Democratic-sponsored legislation to ensure polluters pay for cleanup. “Working with federal and local partners, my administration will stay focused on cleaning up contaminated sites sooner, addressing root causes and holding polluters accountable,” Whitmer said in a statement. She ordered EGLE to formally review its pollution-inspection procedures to strengthen enforcement and accountability. High levels of multiple contaminants were found in soil and groundwater at the site when an inspection was triggered after the brightly colored goo was seen Dec. 20 seeping through a concrete barrier along Interstate 696. Electro-Plating Services was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste, after nearly 50 years of operation, and Madison Heights revoked the company’s occupancy permit. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducted a cleanup in 2017, removing toxic chemicals and pumping contaminated liquid from an earthen pit, but it “was not intended to address all environmental impacts,” the state has said. In November, Electro-Plating was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay nearly $1.5 million in cleanup costs to the EPA. The owner, Gary Sayers, 77, was given a year in federal prison for illegally storing hazardous waste. In 2005, he had pleaded guilty in state court to illegally transporting hazardous waste. ST.

 Dec 30, 2019 Although it should have come as no surprise to anyone, a recent federal study has linked increased beach trash with a decrease in tourist use. Put another way, the more garbage on beaches, the less those beaches — and surrounding businesses — are frequented by visitors. The study, by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, noted plastic pollution of all sorts and balloon debris have a great impact on Great Lakes tourism. “Tourism is a major economic sector along the coast,” said Ya’el Seid-Green, a communications and policy specialist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Debris Program. “So, the results of this study can inform future cleanup projects.” Beach trash, according to NOAA, includes plastic, straws, metal, paper, textiles and fishing gear. Bird feathers, campfire litter, microplastics and neglected boats also fall into this category. The researchers interviewed about 1,300 beachgoers and emailed them a follow-up survey. Although Lake Erie was the focus of the study among the Great Lakes, it’s reasonable to conclude the results can be applied to a broader context. It’s impossible to calculate the total amount of litter in the Great Lakes. But, during 2015 beach cleanups, the Alliance for the Great Lakes reported 46.3 tons of marine debris collected in the region, an astounding amount. Our advice? That’s easy.

 Dec 27, 2019 Trash on Ohio’s Crane Creek State Park beach along Lake Erie is pictured. (Photo courtesy of Benny Mazur via Flickr) LANSING — A nice day at the beach could be ruined by a single drinking straw. The more litter on the beach, the fewer days visitors spend at it, according to a recent study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And fewer tourist days means less money for local economy and eventually a decrease in local jobs. The study reports that plastic pollution and balloon debris have a great impact on Great Lakes tourism. In Lake Erie, the doubling of litter would discourage more than a third of visitors from visiting the beach again, the study said. “Tourism is a major economic sector along the coast,” said Ya’el Seid-Green, a communications and policy specialist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Debris Program. “So, the results of this study can inform future cleanup projects.” The researchers also looked at the economic effect of litter on the Gulf Coast beaches in Alabama, the Atlantic Ocean beaches in Delaware and Maryland and the Pacific Ocean beaches in Orange County, California. They examined the effects of marine debris on beach recreation and the local economy. Marine debris, according to NOAA, could be plastic straws, metal, paper, textile and fishing gear. Bird feathers, campfire litter, microplastics and neglected boats also fall into this category. The researchers interviewed about 1,300 beachgoers and emailed them a follow-up survey. They were asked to rate how much trash they saw on a scale of 1 to 5. A 1 corresponded to one piece of debris per 500 square feet. A score of 5 meant 16 pieces of debris per 500 square feet. “Ohio beaches have the highest levels of debris, while Alabama and Delaware/Maryland have comparatively low levels of debris,” the study said. Ohio scored 2.3 on average and Orange County, California, scored 2.1. Meanwhile, Alabama and Delaware/Maryland scored 1.7 and 1.6 respectively. Other Great Lakes states were not part of the study. Each year, about 8 million trips are made to Lake Erie, the report said. People spend about $96 on average per day during those visits. Of that amount, $73 was added to the local economy in the form of jobs and earnings for local establishments. Tourists near Lake Erie spent around $1.9 billion in 2015 alone, according to Lake Erie Shores & Island, a marketing organization for the region. The number increased to $2.12 billion in 2017. The organization said that almost 14,000 people in the region are employed in tourism-related jobs. But if the amount of litter doubled, the Lake Erie region would lose $218 million in tourism revenue, according to the NOAA study. It would also cost the local economy 3,700 jobs. It’s impossible to calculate the total amount of litter in the Great Lakes. But, during 2015 beach cleanups, the Chicago-based Alliance for the Great Lakes reported 46.3 tons of marine debris collected in the region. More than a third was collected in Ohio and Pennsylvania, which border Lake Erie. Midway through 2019, volunteers from the Alliance of the Great Lakes collected 54,000 pounds of litter from Great Lakes beaches, said Jennifer Caddick, the vice president of communications and engagement for the organization. At least 90% contained plastic. Tourism shouldn’t be the only reason to keep the lakes free from pollution, especially when algae threatens Lake Erie every year, Caddick said. “It’s important to remember that the Great Lakes provide drinking water for approximately 40 million Americans and Canadians, which is a critical reason to keep them pollution-free,” she said.

 Jan 24, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Thursday ended federal protection for many of the nation’s millions of miles of streams, arroyos and wetlands, a sweeping environmental rollback that could leave the waterways more vulnerable to pollution from development, industry and farms. The policy change, signed by heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, narrows the types of waterways that qualify for federal protection under the half-century-old Clean Water Act. Since his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump has targeted environmental and public health regulations that he says imposed unnecessary burdens on business. Speaking to farmers in Texas on Sunday, Trump repeated his frequent charge that an Obama-era attempt in 2015 to more clearly define what water bodies qualify for federal pollution protection was “one of the most ridiculous regulations of all.”” Thursday’s changes to the clean water rule have long been sought by builders, oil and gas developers, farmers and others. But environmental groups and public-health advocates say the rollback will allow businesses to dump pollutants into newly federally unprotected waterways and fill in some wetlands, threatening public water supplies downstream and harming wildlife and habitat. EPA head Andrew Wheeler told reporters Thursday that states were still free to step in with state protections of newly vulnerable waterways if they chose. “Our rule protects the environment and our waterways while respecting the rights of states and property owners,” Wheeler said. The rollback of the clean-water enforcement “strikes the proper balance between Washington, D.C. and the states,” he said. Brett Hartl, a government affairs director with the Center for Biological Diversity conservation advocacy group, called the changes “a sickening gift to polluters.” The administration’s action “will allow wetlands, streams and rivers across a vast stretch of America to be obliterated with pollution,” Hartl said, contending the rollback would speed extinction for dozens of endangered species. “People and wildlife need clean water to thrive. Destroying half of our nation’s streams and wetlands will be one of Trump’s ugliest legacies.” The Trump rule narrows the Obama administration’s 2015 definition of what’s a protected body of water and effectively removes safeguards for some waterways that had been put into place with the 1972 Clean Water Act.The administration says the changes would allow farmers to plow their fields without fear of unintentionally straying over the banks of a federally protected dry creek, bog or ditch. But the government’s own figures show it is real estate developers and those in other nonfarm business sectors that take out the most permits for impinging on wetlands and waterways, and stand to reap the biggest regulatory and financial relief. Environmental groups said the draft version of the rule released earlier would have lifted federal protections for roughly half of the nation’s wetlands and one-fifth of the millions of miles of waterways. The administration challenges that estimate and says it is not possible to come up with a solid figure for how much of the nation’s surface water will be affected.One of the biggest changes applies to so-called ephemeral waters – creeks and rivers that run only after rainfalls or snow melt. Such streams provide a majority of the water for some dry Western states, including New Mexico. “That”s a huge rollback from way before Obama, before Reagan,” said Blan Holman, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. New Mexico officials have particular concerns given that the Rio Grande, which provides drinking water and irrigation supplies for millions of people in the Southwest and Mexico, depends largely on the types of intermittent streams, creeks and wetlands that could lose protection under the rule draft released earlier. The Rio Grande is one of North America’s longest rivers. In a statement, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham called the new rule “an absolute disaster for the state”s water resources. Another key change removes federal protections for wetlands deemed not directly connected to a major waterway. Geoff Gisler, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said it appears millions of acres of the wetlands on the Southeastern coast alone — vital buffers against flooding and climate change — would lose protections, as would so-called prairie pothole wetlands in the middle of the country, and others. The final rule will be published in the Federal Register in the next few days and become effective 60 days after that. Environmental groups and some states are promising legal challenges.

 Mar 16, 2019 WASHINGTON — African-Americans and Hispanics breathe in far more deadly air pollution than they are responsible for making, a new study said. A study looked at who is exposed to fine particle pollution — responsible for about 100,000 American deaths a year — and how much different races are responsible for the pollution based on their buying, driving and living habits. Scientists calculate that Hispanics on average breathe in 63 percent more of the pollution that leads to heart and breathing deaths than they make. For African-Americans the figure is 56 percent, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. On the other hand, non-Hispanic whites on average are exposed to 17 percent less air pollution than they make. “Even though minorities are contributing less to the overall problem of air pollution, they are affected by it more,” said study co-author Jason Hill, a biosystems engineering professor at the University of Minnesota who is white. “Is it fair (that) I create more pollution and somebody else is disproportionately affected by it?” This pollution comes from gases from smokestacks, tailpipes and other places that then solidify into fine invisible particles small enough to pass through lungs and into bloodstreams. These particles, more than 25 times smaller than the width of a human hair, pose the greatest risk to people’s health, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says. While other studies have shown minorities living with more pollution, this study is one of the first to combine buying habits and exposure into one calculation of inequity, Hill said. Hill and colleagues looked at pollution from highways, coal-fired power plants, hog farms and other sources. They then looked in a large scale at who is driving more, buying more goods and food, spending more on property and using more electricity, then traced those purchases to end users. “On average whites tend to consume more than minorities. It’s because of wealth,” Hill said. “It’s largely how much you buy, not buying different things.” Of 103,000 particle pollution deaths a year, 83,000 can be traced to the activities of people in the United States — not government and not goods exported elsewhere, the study said Several outside experts praised the research. “These findings confirm what most grassroots environmental justice leaders have known for decades, ‘whites are dumping their pollution on poor people and people of color’,” said Texas Southern University public affairs professor Robert Bullard, who was not part of the research. Bullard, often called the father of environmental justice , is African-American. Bullard said his and other past research shows that African-Americans are 79 percent more likely than whites to live where industrial pollution is highest, with people of color overrepresented near Superfund sites and oil refineries. He said there are far more mostly minority schools within 500 feet of major highways than mostly white schools. “Being able to quantify the inequity is a key step toward addressing and reducing inequity,” said Christopher Frey, a professor of environmental engineering at North Carolina State University, who is white and not part of the research. One bright spot is that in recent decades the air has been getting cleaner in general, Hill said. However, his study stopped in 2015 and EPA data shows an uptick in fine particle pollution in 2017. But even with the cleaner air, it is still inequitable, Hill said. PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Drive-thru sites have been opening around the United States to make it quicker and safer ...

 Dec 6, 2018 WASHINGTON (AP) — After several years of little growth, global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide experienced their largest jump in seven years, discouraging scientists. World carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to have risen 2.7 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to three studies released Wednesday from the Global Carbon Project, an international scientific collaboration of academics, governments and industry that tracks greenhouse gas emissions. The calculations, announced during negotiations to put the 2015 Paris climate accord into effect, puts some of the landmark agreement’s goals nearly out of reach, scientists said. “This is terrible news,” said Andrew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive, which models greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures but was not part of the research. “Every year that we delay serious climate action, the Paris goals become more difficult to meet.” The studies concluded that this year the world would spew 40.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion tons last year. The margin of error is about one percentage point on either side. The Global Carbon Project uses government and industry reports to come up with final emission figures for 2017 and projections for 2018 based on the four biggest polluters: China, the United States, India and the European Union. The U.S., which had been steadily decreasing its carbon pollution, showed a significant rise in emissions — up 2.5 percent — for the first time since 2013. China, the globe’s biggest carbon emitter, saw its largest increase since 2011: 4.6 percent. Study lead author Corinne Le Quere, a climate change researcher at the University of East Anglia in England, said the increase is a surprising “reality check” after a few years of smaller emission increases. But she also doesn’t think the world will return to the even larger increases seen from 2003 to 2008. She believes unusual factors are at play this year. For the U.S., it was a combination of a hot summer and cold winter that required more electricity use for heating and cooling. For China, it was an economic stimulus that pushed coal-powered manufacturing, Le Quere said. John Reilly, co-director of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, said the results aren’t too surprising because fossil fuels still account for 81 percent of the world’s energy use. The burning of coal, oil and gas release carbon dioxide, which warms the Earth . Reilly, who wasn’t part of the study, praised it as impressive. Global Carbon Project chairman Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist, said he was discouraged. The Paris accord set two goals. The long-held goal would limit global warming to no more than 1.8 degrees from now, with a more ambitious goal of limiting warming to 0.9 degrees from now. The trend is such that the world would have to be lucky to keep warming to 1.8 degrees, let alone the lower goal, Le Quere said. China increased its emissions to 11.4 billion tons, while the U.S. jumped to a shade under 6 billion tons. The European Union spewed 3.9 billion tons and India soared to 2.9 billion tons. Overall, the world is spewing about 1,300 tons. Use of coal — the biggest carbon emitter — is rising. And while countries are using more renewable fuels and trying to reduce carbon from electricity production, emissions from cars and planes are steadily increasing, Le Quere said. Global carbon dioxide emissions have increased 55 percent in the last 20 years, the calculations show. At the same time, Earth has warmed on average about two-thirds of a degree, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 May 17, 2018 BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Environmental groups challenged the Trump administration in federal court Wednesday over its rejection of an Obama-era proposal that would have required mining companies to prove they have enough money to clean up their pollution. The Idaho Conservation League, Earthworks, Sierra Club and other groups filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. asking it to review last year’s move to drop the rule. An attorney for the environmental groups said the reversal under Trump leaves taxpayers responsible into the future for mining pollution that fouls waterways and endangers public health. The proposal applied to “hard-rock” mines that extract gold, iron, lead and other minerals, but not coal. Mining industry representatives and members of Congress from Western states pushed to kill the rule, arguing it was unnecessary and duplicated cleanup requirements already enforced at the state and federal level. In December, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt agreed with the industry’s contention that modern mining techniques decrease pollution risks. During the tenure of former President Barack Obama, the EPA determined the opposite — that mining pollution remains an ongoing concern and companies should be required to provide “financial assurances” such as surety bonds for possible cleanup projects. There is a long legacy of taxpayer-funded mine cleanups at many sites where companies went bankrupt and abandoned polluted sites. Trump’s EPA “just waved their hands at all their prior findings and offered some really flimsy rationale for why they shouldn’t be considered,” said Earthjustice attorney Amanda Goodin, who represents the environmental groups. “It’s a thinly veiled handout to the mining industry.” Hard-rock mining companies would have faced a combined $7.1 billion financial obligation under the Obama era rule, costing them up to $171 million annually to set aside sufficient funds to pay for future cleanups, according to an EPA analysis. Since 1980, at least 52 mines and mine processing sites had spills or other releases of pollution, according to documents previously released by the EPA. The industry’s troubles were highlighted in 2015, when an EPA cleanup team accidentally triggered a 3-million gallon (11-million liter) spill of contaminated water from Colorado’s inactive Gold King mine, tainting rivers in three states with heavy metals including arsenic and lead. The financial assurance rule was proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency in January 2017 after environmental groups pressed the government to enforce a long-ignored provision in the 1980 federal Superfund law. Coal mines are required to provide assurances that they will pay for pollution cleanups under a 1977 federal law. PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 Mar 3, 2018 BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Major utilities have found evidence of groundwater contamination at coal-burning power plants across the U.S. where landfills and man-made ponds have been used for decades as dumping grounds for coal ash, according to data released by plant owners under a Friday deadline. Heightened levels of pollutants– including arsenic and radium in some cases — were documented at plants in numerous states, from Virginia and North Carolina to Washington and Alaska. The Environmental Protection Agency required the plant owners to install test wells to monitor groundwater pollution as a first step toward cleaning up the sites. The future of that effort was cast into uncertainty Thursday when the Trump administration announced it intends to roll back aspects of the program to reduce the industry’s compliance costs by up to $100 million annually. “There’s no dispute that the underlying groundwater is being contaminated. We see that clearly,” said Duke University professor Avner Vengosh, who researches the effects of coal ash and has reviewed some of the new data. “The real question is whether it’s migrating toward people or wells next to (coal plants).” Vengosh added that the discovery at some sites of radium at levels far exceeding drinking water standards — which can increase the risk of cancer — were of particular concern. It appears to mark the first time coal ash has been associated with radioactivity in groundwater, he said. Duke Energy spokeswoman Erin Culbert noted that government-sponsored research has shown most coal ash does not have radioactive elements, and the issue does not represent a health concern for neighbors of its plants. The Associated Press conducted an initial review of the reports, which were still being filed Friday, and spoke with power company executives across the country, who warned against misinterpreting the pollution data. Generally, they said further studies were needed to confirm the ash storage sites as the source of the contamination and whether public drinking water supplies were threatened. U.S. coal plants produce about 100 million tons annually of ash and other waste, much of which ends up in old, unlined disposal ponds that are prone to leaking. Some have been in use for decades. Among large U.S. utilities, Duke Energy reported preliminary findings of contamination of groundwater at 48 ash basins and landfills. American Electric Power, or AEP, reported potential groundwater impacts at 24 ash disposal sites. Dominion Energy, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Xcel Energy and others also reported evidence of contamination. Mark McCullough, executive vice president at AEP, said the company needed more data to decide which sites will need to close. “These (monitoring) wells that are close to the sites are telling us something, and we are committed to doing the hard work and to understand where the real source is and what it is,” McCullough said. Pam Faggert, the chief environmental officer for Richmond, Virginia-based Dominion, said the company also conducts surface water tests near its facilities and was confident that the groundwater impacts were not having an effect on public drinking water or public safety offsite. Coal ash storage and disposal went largely unregulated until a 2008 spill at a Tennessee Valley Authority power plant in Kingston, Tennessee. A containment dike burst and flooding covered more than 300 acres , dumped waste into two nearby rivers, destroyed homes and brought national attention to the issue. In 2014, an estimated 39,000 tons of coal ash spewed into the Dan River after a drainage pipe running below a waste dump collapsed at a Duke Energy plant in Eden, North Carolina. The toxic sludge turned the river gray for more than 70 miles). Apart from spills, other ash problems have been documented across the country. In Montana, an estimated 200 million gallons (757 million liters) of contaminated water a year are leaking into the groundwater from ash ponds in the city of Colstrip, leaving the water undrinkable. In North Carolina, some neighbors of Duke power plants have been relying on bottled water since toxic chemicals appeared in some of their wells. In Virginia, Dominion has offered to hook some neighbors of the Possum Point Power Station up to municipal water or filtration systems after groundwater testing found elevated levels of some contaminants. Remediation work at some coal ash disposal areas already is underway. AEP has closed six ash storage sites to date, the company said. Duke Energy has started excavation work at 11 sites and had spent $1.4 billion on such efforts through last December, the company disclosed last week. It plans to spend another $2.5 billion on ash site closures over the next five years. Attorney Frank Holleman with the Southern Environmental Law Center said the disclosure of the utilities’ data was critical to informing the public about how much arsenic, mercury and other pollutants are leaking into groundwater supplies. He pushed back against the utilities’ argument that the data so far has been largely indicative of on-site contamination, not a broader public health threat, saying groundwater doesn’t stay in one place — it moves and flows. “The groundwater resources of these communities are not something that the utilities have a right to trash and throw away,” he said. “They don’t own the groundwater.

 Nov 18, 2017 WASHINGTON (AP) — Global carbon pollution rose this year after three straight years when levels of the heat-trapping gas didn’t go up at all, scientists reported Monday. Preliminary figures project that worldwide carbon dioxide emissions are up about 2 percent this year, according to an international team of scientists. Most of the increase came from China. The report by the Global Carbon Project team dashed hopes that emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas had peaked. “We hoped that we had turned the corner… We haven’t,” said study co-author Rob Jackson, an Earth scientist at Stanford University. Carbon dioxide emissions rose steadily and slowly starting in the late 1880s with the Industrial Revolution, then took off dramatically in the 1950s. In the last three years, levels had stabilized at about 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide (36.2 billion metric tons). Estimates for 2017 put it at about 40.8 billion tons (37 billion metric tons). Sixty years ago , the world spewed only 9.2 billion tons (8.3 billion metric tons). “It’s a bit staggering,” said co-author Ralph Keeling, a Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientist, noting in an email that levels have increased fourfold since he was born in the 1950s. “We race headlong into the unknown.” Man-made carbon dioxide is causing more than 90 percent of global warming since 1950, U.S. scientists reported this month. This year’s increase was mostly spurred by a 3.5 percent jump in Chinese carbon pollution, said study co-author Glen Peters, a Norwegian scientist. Declines in the United States (0.4 percent) and Europe (0.2 percent) were smaller than previous years. India, the No. 3 carbon polluting nation, went up 2 percent. The 2017 estimate comes to on average of 2.57 million pounds (1.16 million kilograms) of carbon dioxide spewing into the air every second. The study was published Monday and is being presented in Bonn, Germany, during climate talks where leaders are trying to come up with rules for the 2015 Paris deal. The goal is to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times, but it’s already warmed half that amount. “It was tough enough and if this paper is indicative of long-term trends, it just got tougher,” said Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who wasn’t part of the team of 76 scientists who wrote the report. While he called the study authoritative, Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said he sees no need to do figures for 2017 that are not complete, saying it may be “jumping the gun a bit.” Jackson said the team — which produces these reports every year in November — has confidence in its 2017 report because it is based on real data from top polluting nations through the summer and in some cases through October. Plus, he said past estimates have been correct within a couple tenths of a percentage point. The top five carbon polluting countries are China, the United States, India, Russia and Japan.

 Jul 18, 2017 LOWELL, Mass. (AP) — They hide in weeds along hiking trails and in playground grass. They wash into rivers and float downstream to land on beaches. They pepper baseball dugouts, sidewalks and streets. Syringes left by drug users amid the heroin crisis are turning up everywhere. In Portland, Maine, officials have collected more than 700 needles so far this year, putting them on track to handily exceed the nearly 900 gathered in all of 2016. In March alone, San Francisco collected more than 13,000 syringes, compared with only about 2,900 the same month in 2016. People, often children, risk getting stuck by discarded needles, raising the prospect they could contract blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis or HIV or be exposed to remnants of heroin or other drugs. It’s unclear whether anyone has gotten sick, but the reports of children finding the needles can be sickening in their own right. One 6-year-old girl in California mistook a discarded syringe for a thermometer and put it in her mouth; she was unharmed. “I just want more awareness that this is happening,” said Nancy Holmes, whose 11-year-old daughter stepped on a needle in Santa Cruz, California, while swimming. “You would hear stories about finding needles at the beach or being poked at the beach. But you think that it wouldn’t happen to you. Sure enough.” They are a growing problem in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, two states that have seen many overdose deaths in recent years. “We would certainly characterize this as a health hazard,” said Tim Soucy, health director in Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city, which collected 570 needles in 2016, the first year it began tracking the problem. It has found 247 needles so far this year. Needles turn up in places like parks, baseball diamonds, trails and beaches — isolated spots where drug users can gather and attract little attention, and often the same spots used by the public for recreation. The needles are tossed out of carelessness or the fear of being prosecuted for possessing them. One child was poked by a needle left on the grounds of a Utah elementary school. Another youngster stepped on one while playing on a beach in New Hampshire. Even if adults or children don’t get sick, they still must endure an unsettling battery of tests to make sure they didn’t catch anything. The girl who put a syringe in her mouth was not poked but had to be tested for hepatitis B and C, her mother said. Some community advocates are trying to sweep up the pollution. Rocky Morrison leads a cleanup effort along the Merrimack River, which winds through the old milling city of Lowell, and has recovered hundreds of needles in abandoned homeless camps that dot the banks, as well as in piles of debris that collect in floating booms he recently started setting. He has a collection of several hundred needles in a fishbowl, a prop he uses to illustrate that the problem is real and that towns must do more to combat it. “We started seeing it last year here and there. But now, it’s just raining needles everywhere we go,” said Morrison, a burly, tattooed construction worker whose Clean River Project has six boats working parts of the 117-mile (188-kilometer) river. Among the oldest tracking programs is in Santa Cruz, California, where the community group Take Back Santa Cruz has reported finding more than 14,500 needles in the county over the past 4 1/2 years. It says it has gotten reports of 12 people getting stuck, half of them children. “It’s become pretty commonplace to find them. We call it a rite of passage for a child to find their first needle,” said Gabrielle Korte, a member of the group’s needle team. “It’s very depressing. It’s infuriating. It’s just gross.” Some experts say the problem will ease only when more users get treatment and more funding is directed to treatment programs. Others are counting on needle exchange programs, now present in more than 30 states, or the creation of safe spaces to shoot up — already introduced in Canada and proposed by U.S. state and city officials from New York to Seattle. Studies have found that needle exchange programs can reduce pollution, said Don Des Jarlais, a researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai hospital in New York. But Morrison and Korte complain poor supervision at needle exchanges will simply put more syringes in the hands of people who may not dispose of them properly. After complaints of discarded needles, Santa Cruz County took over its exchange from a nonprofit in 2013 and implemented changes. It did away with mobile exchanges and stopped allowing drug users to get needles without turning in an equal number of used ones, said Jason Hoppin, a spokesman for Santa Cruz County. Along the Merrimack, nearly three dozen riverfront towns are debating how to stem the flow of needles. Two regional planning commissions are drafting a request for proposals for a cleanup plan. They hope to have it ready by the end of July. “We are all trying to get a grip on the problem,” said Haverhill Mayor James Fiorentini. “The stuff comes from somewhere. If we can work together to stop it at the source, I am all for it.” PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Drive-thru sites have been opening around the United States to make it quicker and safer ...

url: https://www.thealpenanews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/agencies-to-hold-update-meeting-on-oscoda-pfc-pollution-issue/
 Apr 15, 2017 OSCODA — Representatives from several agencies will be holding a public meeting April 25 in Oscoda to update the public on the perflorinated chemical pollution of drinking water wells in the area, according to a press release from District Health Department No. 2. The event will be held at the Oscoda Methodist Church, located at 120 W. Dwight Avenue, with representatives from DHD No. 2, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Air Force. DHD No. 2 Health Officer Denise Bryan said it has been more than a year since the department issued the initial health advisory to residents. Since that time the scope of pollution has widened and more and more residents are in need of a potable source of drinking water. The meeting will be from 6-8 p.m and cover topics such as sampling results, alternate water supplies, monitoring of the situation and the status of the investigation. From 2-4 p.m., there will be an open house that will allow for one-on-one conversations. DHD No. 2 strongly encourages individuals to attend these events, Bryan said. At this time, the area of concern remains properties between the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base and Van Etten Lake, and properties between Van Etten Lake and Lake Huron, from the US 23/F-41 split north to Chippewa Road. Previously only wells around the base were of concern. Environmental Health Director/Deputy Health Officer Chuck Lichon said it is hard to predict if the pollution, which came from firefighting chemicals used by the Air Force, is spreading. “There is no way to predict at the current time where the plume will extend,” he said “It will extend to Lake Huron, we know that, but you never know where groundwater is going to go.” To help combat the pollution Lichon said the health department has been installing reverse osmosis equipment into homes in the Oscoda area, or installing water bottle coolers, so there is safe drinking water. He said there are more than 300 wells affected so far. He said the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is sinking test wells in areas and taking water samples. Lichon said right now DHD No. 2’s role in the community is to help residents find clean water sources. “Either they are getting the reverse osmosis system — most people are taking that system over the having the water cooler — put in their homes and we work with them,” he said. “We attend meetings and we are kind of a go between with the township and the state, that has been kind of our role in this.” So far Lichon said there have been 65 reverse osmosis systems and 22 water cooler systems installed, with some pending systems to be installed in Oscoda. Lichon said he was unsure what new information would be presented at the meeting, but it was a good way for the public to get refreshed on the situation. “It’s an updating on where things stand, and information that we may have,” he said. “There are seasonal residents too that have not been in the area since last fall, it gives them a chance to ask questions of the state and the Air Force and it kind of gives them a chance for the feedback.” Lichon said one new aspect of the issue is Bryan asking the state for more funding to help replace the filters in the reverse osmosis systems installed a year ago. “The filters are a few hundred dollars,” he said. “We’re hoping to get some reply back on that. That is one issue. The ultimate fix would be to extend the municipal water to these locations.” Jason Ogden can be reached via email at jogden@thealpenanews.com or by phone at 358-5693.

url: https://www.thealpenanews.com/news/2016/12/pollution-from-dead-ivy-league-lab-mice-worries-neighborhood/
 Dec 27, 2016 HANOVER, N.H. (AP) — Neighbors of Dartmouth College property where for years the Ivy League school disposed of mice and other small animals used in science experiments say they fear pollution from the site has contaminated their groundwater and they worry the school hasn’t been completely up front with them. The site has contaminated the well water of at least one family, that of Richard and Debbie Higgins, who blame a variety of health problems on it, including rashes, hair and skin loss and dizziness. Even their dogs were not spared, they say, with one urinating blood and another vomiting. “We have been drinking the water for years and we had no idea, absolutely no idea,” Debbie Higgins said. Few nearby residents even knew the half-acre plot on the college’s Rennie Farm was used from the 1960s until 1978 to dump carcasses from “tracer experiments,” in which scientists used radioactive compounds to see how things moved through life systems. A nearby site also contained remains of human cadavers and stillborn fetuses used in medical classes. The obscurity of the fenced site changed in 2011, when Dartmouth chose to clean it up, removing 40 tons of carcasses and soil from scores of unlined pits that were legal at the time they were dug. That led to the discovery of hazardous waste and low-level radioactive materials and eventually evidence that at least one chemical used in the animal experiments, the suspected carcinogen 1,4-dioxane, had leaked into the groundwater. It was initially found at 50 times the state standard of 3 parts per billion on the site and more recently as high as 600 parts per billion in the ground. The chemical has been linked to eye, nose and throat irritation and, in long-term exposure, to liver and kidney damage, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The 1,4-dioxane was eventually found to have migrated off the site and contaminated the Higginses’ well across the street, about 800 feet from the site — at twice the state standard. They learned in September 2015 that their well was polluted, and now depend on bottled water supplied by Dartmouth for cooking and drinking. The news has rattled the semi-rural neighborhood, sparking anger and fear among dozens of homeowners who worry the plume will reach their own wells and damage their property values. Many contend Dartmouth was too slow to respond once it found the contamination and has been reluctant to provide full details of what was on the site — something the college denies. “Right now, everyone is very confused and concerned,” said Ellen Waitzkin, a radiologist who lives across from the site. “They are trying to determine on what basis they should feel threatened or not.” The Higginses and other residents argue an alert about the spreading contamination should have gone out earlier. New Hampshire environmental and Dartmouth officials said initial test showed the levels of 1,4-dioxane were declining on the site and were projected to remain on the farm site — though state officials now concede there could have been more aggressive monitoring.

 January 20, 2020 So much has been in the news about plastic and how it is harming our environment. There has been a major push in the United States to eliminate plastic straws, plastic bags, and many other items that have caused major pollution in our waterways. Unfortunately, we can only make a marginal dent in plastic pollution. U.S. citizens simply aren’t the major cause of plastic pollution, although I certainly condone and commend those that choose paper over plastic. Let’s take a look at a few alarming statistics. Since the 1950’s the world has produced 8.3 metric tons of plastic. It is everywhere and it unfortunately is non-biodegradable. Only 9% of the world’s plastic has been recycled. Another 12% is incinerated. That leaves 80% sitting in landfills, waterways, alongside roads or wherever. It will remain in those places forever, unless we find a solution. The really sad truth, however is that plastic kills nearly 1 million seabirds, 100,000 sea mammals and millions of fish each year. The volume of plastic trash found in our oceans is estimated at 150 million tons. Each year nearly 8 million tons are added to our oceans. That’s, believe it or not, one truckload a minute of plastic pouring in to our oceans. Nearly one-quarter of the ocean plastic trash is first dumped in rivers, and then of course, finds its way downstream in to our oceans. It is a sad commentary of our society, indeed. The United States can only make a small dent because 95% if the river-then ocean plastic waste comes from ten rivers- none of them close to the U.S. Four of the rivers are located in China. They are the Yangtze, which flows into the East China Sea; the Hai he and the Yellow rivers, both dumping plastic in to the Yellow Sea; and the Pearl which goes to the South China Sea. The biggest culprit is the Yangtze. It ejects more plastic in to the sea than the other nine culprits combined. Try 1.5 million metric tons a year. The Indus River, which actually rises in China, and runs through India and Pakistan and ends in the Arabian Sea is the second highest. It alone pours upwards to 150,000 metric tons of plastic in to the sea. The other five rivers that are on the dubious list are the Nile and Niger in Africa, the Ganges in India, the Mekong in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, and the Amur in Russia. Scientists in Germany that have been studying the problem think that a quick fix is possible. They suggest we focus our waste management efforts on the aforementioned 10 rivers, particularly the Yangtze. Simply by halving the amount of plastic waste flowing in these 10 rivers would reduce the global flow of river-borne plastic waste in to oceans by nearly 50%. Many of us have seen the trash that exists in the Yangtze and other Asian rivers. Graphic photos have been posted all over social media. I look and I find some of those photos unbelievable. And then I also think about the poor sea-life that is being killed because of human carelessness. Plastic was a great invention in the mid-1900’s, but now it has become a major problem. It won’t bio-degrade. It is with us forever. As the human race, we’ve got to do a better job of converting to bio-degradable alternatives. var icx_publication_id = 13527; var icx_copyright_notice = 'Copyright 2020 The Marion Press'; var icx_content_id = '22622'; Click here for reuse options!

 January 20, 2020 So much has been in the news about plastic and how it is harming our environment. There has been a major push in the United States to eliminate plastic straws, plastic bags, and many other items that have caused major pollution in our waterways. Unfortunately, we can only make a marginal dent in plastic pollution. U.S. citizens simply aren’t the major cause of plastic pollution, although I certainly condone and commend those that choose paper over plastic. Let’s take a look at a few alarming statistics. Since the 1950’s the world has produced 8.3 metric tons of plastic. It is everywhere and it unfortunately is non-biodegradable. Only 9% of the world’s plastic has been recycled. Another 12% is incinerated. That leaves 80% sitting in landfills, waterways, alongside roads or wherever. It will remain in those places forever, unless we find a solution. The really sad truth, however is that plastic kills nearly 1 million seabirds, 100,000 sea mammals and millions of fish each year. The volume of plastic trash found in our oceans is estimated at 150 million tons. Each year nearly 8 million tons are added to our oceans. That’s, believe it or not, one truckload a minute of plastic pouring in to our oceans. Nearly one-quarter of the ocean plastic trash is first dumped in rivers, and then of course, finds its way downstream in to our oceans. It is a sad commentary of our society, indeed. The United States can only make a small dent because 95% if the river-then ocean plastic waste comes from ten rivers- none of them close to the U.S. Four of the rivers are located in China. They are the Yangtze, which flows into the East China Sea; the Hai he and the Yellow rivers, both dumping plastic in to the Yellow Sea; and the Pearl which goes to the South China Sea. The biggest culprit is the Yangtze. It ejects more plastic in to the sea than the other nine culprits combined. Try 1.5 million metric tons a year. The Indus River, which actually rises in China, and runs through India and Pakistan and ends in the Arabian Sea is the second highest. It alone pours upwards to 150,000 metric tons of plastic in to the sea. The other five rivers that are on the dubious list are the Nile and Niger in Africa, the Ganges in India, the Mekong in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, and the Amur in Russia. Scientists in Germany that have been studying the problem think that a quick fix is possible. They suggest we focus our waste management efforts on the aforementioned 10 rivers, particularly the Yangtze. Simply by halving the amount of plastic waste flowing in these 10 rivers would reduce the global flow of river-borne plastic waste in to oceans by nearly 50%. Many of us have seen the trash that exists in the Yangtze and other Asian rivers. Graphic photos have been posted all over social media. I look and I find some of those photos unbelievable. And then I also think about the poor sea-life that is being killed because of human carelessness. Plastic was a great invention in the mid-1900’s, but now it has become a major problem. It won’t bio-degrade. It is with us forever. As the human race, we’ve got to do a better job of converting to bio-degradable alternatives. var icx_publication_id = 13527; var icx_copyright_notice = 'Copyright 2020 The Marion Press'; var icx_content_id = '22622'; Click here for reuse options!

 June 7, 2018 By Julie Traynor
Correspondent For kids in mid-century Marion, Michigan, the hot days of summer meant a trip to the new Village swimming pool, just below the dam. The pool venture was quite an undertaking by the folks of Marion and they sought to do things up right. Improvements featured a sandy beach, better diving board, a life guard on duty, and swings. The upgraded swimming site, located between the base of the dam and the highway, was the highlight of the summer of 1956 and was indeed a big deal. Only ten years before the Michigan Department of Health had declared a long stretch of the Middle Branch River, the Mill Pond and swimming hole polluted and unfit for swimming. Before construction could begin on the low, pool creating, 64 foot concrete ‘dam’ and walk-way, the flow over the big dam was diverted through the smaller causeway and the Wing dam. Local potato farmer John Hesselink used his irrigation equipment to draw down remaining water from the site and the old river bed was cleaned up and improved. The Marion Kiwanis donated $100 to the project to cover the cost of the concrete retaining wall for the north side of the pool. The old swimming hole in 1937 was above the dam and enjoyed much use. Among those in this photo are Johnny Alberts and Arlene Raymond Swiler, the girl in the dress on the far right. Prior to this project generations of local kids found different places along the Middle Branch to swim and cool off on hot summer days. The earliest identifiable photographic evidence we know is of kids swimming at the pond and playing in the waters above, and just to the north of the dam; a site where at one time sawdust from one of the local mills was dumped in abundance. That did not stop local swimmers. A make shift diving board and a rope hung from a tree were all that was needed for hours of wet entertainment and summer fun. This location in the valley of the Middle Branch of the Muskegon River is the reason we are here. Founder Christopher Clark sought the perfect place to build a pond and mill and he found it here. The Middle Branch became a highway for shipping logs to local mills and the Muskegon River beyond. Folks then saw the river as both a convenience and a hindrance; useful when needed for transportation or the disposal of trash, bothersome when it overflowed its banks. Unfortunately for many years this kind of thinking also meant a good deal of abuse of its waters. For much of the first half of the 20th century, the Middle Branch, on its twisted course through the Village, also served as a dumping ground for anything the local citizenry chose to toss into it; including a good deal of glass, scrap metals, trash and unfiltered sewage. The belief was that once something was tossed into the river it was simply just gone. There were no ramifications to it. The below the dam swimming hole of 1956, before, during and after major improvements were made. In 1946 the state health department declared the Middle Branch and the Mill Pond, referred to as Lake Marion at that time, a no swim zone due to pollution. By the early 1950’s Marionites were taking a different look at the local waters. The Michigan Conservation Department deemed the Middle Branch a dirty, polluted river and in trouble, and cleaned waters above Marion, from Stone’s Dam to the pond. Locally, the Rod and Gun Club, Kiwanis, Boy Scouts and church groups took up the torch, working to clean up the river beyond the dam. We gained a new and much deserved respect for the Middle Branch. Ten years later the new pool was born and gave several generations of Marion kids warm summer memories. We apologize for the quality of this newsprint photo from the front page of the Marion Press, June 28, 1956. It shows John Hesselink working with his irrigation equipment to drain the pool. Not many are seen swimming in the local waters today. The diving board is long gone and fishermen replaced sunbathers on the now grassy beach a long time ago. Better access to the grounds gives visitors a great place to picnic and fish. The sounds of children at play still echo through our little valley on the Middle Branch. var icx_publication_id = 13527; var icx_copyright_notice = 'Copyright 2018 The Marion Press'; var icx_content_id = '17482'; Click here for reuse options!

 Intervals of clouds and sunshine in the morning with more clouds for later in the day. High 48F. Winds light and variable.. A few clouds. Low 34F. Winds SSE at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: March 23, 2020 @ 11:40 pm Traverse City, MI SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) — The owner of an oil pipeline that spewed thousands of barrels of crude oil onto Southern California beaches in 2015 will pay $60 million to to settle allegations that it violated safety laws, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday. Texas-based Plains All American Pipeline didn't admit any wrongdoing or liability in the consent decree that will end a lawsuit filed on behalf of federal and state agencies. But it agreed to operational changes and to five years of federal and state scrutiny to ensure it is obeying the pollution and safety rules. The agreement still must undergo a public comment period and needs federal court approval. On May 19, 2015, oil gushed from a corroded pipeline north of Refugio State Beach in Santa Barbara County, northwest of Los Angeles. The spill blackened popular beaches for miles, killed or fouled hundred of seabirds, seals and other wildlife and hurt tourism and fishing. It was the worst California coastal oil spill since 1969. Nearly 3,000 barrels of oil were released, or about 100,000 gallons. Federal inspectors found that Plains had made several preventable errors, failed to quickly detect the pipeline rupture and responded too slowly as oil flowed toward the ocean. Plains operators working from a Texas control room more than 1,000 miles away had turned off an alarm that would have signaled a leak and, unaware a spill had occurred, restarted the hemorrhaging line after it had shut down, which only made matters worse, inspectors found. Plains apologized for the spill and paid for the cleanup. The company's 2017 annual report estimated costs from the spill at $335 million, not including lost revenues. The company also revised its plans for dealing with onshore pipeline spills. The consent decree includes $24 million in penalties and more than $22 million in compensation for damage to the environment. That money will be used for restoration, recreation, education and research projects. Plains also agreed to bring its nationwide pipeline system into compliance with federal safety laws. The spill crippled the local oil business because the pipeline was used to transport crude to refineries from seven offshore rigs, including three owned by Exxon Mobil, that have been idle since the spill. Plains has applied for permission to build a pipeline. The decree “represents a significant step and is the culmination of collaborative discussions with federal and state agencies over the course of a multi-year period," Plains spokesman Brad Leone said in a statement. “The consent decree sets forth certain improvement actions that we are implementing into our operations. We take our responsibility for the safe delivery of energy resources very seriously." California's worst coastal oil spill was the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill that leaked at least 80,000 barrels of crude, or about 3 million gallons, into the Santa Barbara Channel.

 The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. DETROIT (AP) — An industrial site in Oakland County from where a bright green goo seeped through a concrete barrier onto an area freeway could be foreclosed due to non-payment of property taxes, the county treasurer said Wednesday. Five properties tied to Electro-Plating Services Inc. in Madison Heights owe a total of more than $30,000 in taxes, interest and fees from 2017 and 2018, according to the Oakland County Treasurer's office. The leak was noticed late last year along Interstate 696, about 2 miles north of Detroit's northern city limits. EPA, other officials to brief area residents on toxic Madison Heights site Monday Oakland County identifies seven contaminated sites in need of assessment "The infamous 'green ooze' site ... has all of us on high-alert," Treasurer Andy Meisner said in a release. "I am doing everything within my power as treasurer to hold the owners accountable and to prevent this burden from shifting onto the backs of taxpayers." Michigan property tax law requires that the state be alerted when a site subject to property tax foreclosure "is believed to be contaminated," according to Meisner. Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. Meisner sent a letter Wednesday to Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. If taxes remain unpaid, the property will become tax foreclosed after March 31, Meisner said. State says "green ooze" not impacting drinking water Testing for toxic waste from Madison Heights site expands to Hazel Park Electro-Plating Services was shut down in 2016 for mismanagement of industrial waste. Owner Gary Sayers is serving a year in federal prison for illegally storing hazardous waste. The Associated Press left a message Wednesday seeking comment from Sayers' defense attorney. The leak along the shoulder of I-696 prompted a new investigation that determined high levels of numerous toxins, including hexavalent chromium were in soil and groundwater at the site. Those toxins are associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage. Man blamed for green I-696 ooze left barrels on Thumb land Madison Heights awaits EPA timeline for cleanup of contaminated site near I-696 State officials concluded earlier this year that the site posed no risk to drinking water and there was a low risk for the migration of contaminates off site. Cleanup has been costly. EGLE district coordinator Tracy Kecskemeti told Michigan lawmakers in January that efforts to contain the leak had cost at least $200,000 over 24 days.

 A $1 million clean-up along the Bear Creek drain in Warren is nearing completion. (Screen grab from Macomb County Office of Public Works video) A $1 million clean-up along the Bear Creek drain in Warren is nearing completion. (Screen grab from Macomb County Office of Public Works video) A $1 million clean up along the Bear Creek Drain, as a result of a diesel fuel leak from a BP gas station on Mound Road, just north of Interstate 696, is nearing completion, according to the Macomb County Office of Public Works. A press release Monday said the corrective action is expected to be completed in approximately one week. In March 2019, a leak into the drain was discovered. The old fuel was bubbling up into the drain. Immediately, booms and other temporary containment measures were put into place while a longer-term solution was developed. Now, a containment trench has been created that will capture any potential leaks from the gas station, allowing them to be pumped out prior to entering the drain. The containment trench will be checked on a regular basis until it is reported as clean continuously for two years. "Our office discovered this contamination in the drain, and we immediately began to work with the property owner, who has been a great corporate citizen," Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said. "With this action, we have eliminated a source of pollution in one of our drains, which ultimately carries water out to Lake St. Clair. There is no one single action needed to keep our water clean, but many actions, taken together across our region is what makes the difference." "During this work, it was important to us to not only protect the drain, but to work with the owner of this BP station to allow them to remain in operation," Miller said. "It's a very busy truck refueling center along one of our most utilized industrial corridors. We did not want to interrupt the industry in that area. Serving as a component of economic vitality for our residents is our goal, along with keeping our water clean." Work crews are out in the county's open drains -- those that appear as small creeks or rivers -- across the county every day, MCPWO officials said, ensuring proper flow, removing any blockages such as dead trees, and looking for problem spots. MCPWPO has also inspected numerous closed county drains -- massive pipes that travel under major roads around the county. Officials said a new closed drain inspection is scheduled to begin next week on the Lake Boulevard Drain, which runs west-east from Interstate 94 to Lake St. Clair, just north of 12 Mile Road, in Roseville and St. Clair Shores. -- Macomb Daily Online Editor Don Gardner

 Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. A couple hundred Madison Heights area residents applauded several times Monday night as they learned of actions taken since a green ooze on I-696 revealed toxic contamination leaking from the former Electro-Plating Services site on 10 Mile Road. But some still have questions with no quick answers, including about whether the pollution will affect their property values. No contamination in Warren drains from green ooze, mayor says Whitmer considers more criminal charges in 'green ooze' pollution case One of the most surprising facts to come out Monday is that Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has an annual budget of only $15 million and there are 9,000 contaminated sites in southeast Michigan. The cleanup in Madison Heights is expected to cost in “the low millions” of dollars, said Tracy Keoskemeti EGLE, and the agency doesn’t have the money. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter said he was shocked to learn of the low funding level. Money is needed to tear down the three Electro-Plating Services buildings and clean up the site. Madison Heights awaits EPA timeline for cleanup of contaminated site near I-696 David Coulter calls green ooze situation a 'catastrophe' in testimony to lawmakers “I’ve promised the county will help provide the resources to tear down that building,” Coulter said. “We’re not going to let demolition costs be an impediment to the cleanup.” Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. U.S. Rep. Andy Levin said reform laws are needed so that polluters have to pay for their actions. “We have to fully fund EPA to go after corporate polluters,” he said. “We’ve got to do better.” Soil, groundwater and vapor samples thus far have not indicated contamination spreading beyond the site and immediate surroundings, according to the Environmental Protection Agency and EGLE. Testing and test results are continuing, Keoskemeti said. The ooze that spread onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20 did get into the stormwater system and Bear Creek, both of which ultimately reach Lake St. Clair. Oakland County identifies seven contaminated sites in need of assessment Testing for toxic waste from Madison Heights site expands to Hazel Park State says "green ooze" not impacting drinking water However, the contaminants were diluted enough by the time they reached the lake that it is not expected to impact water quality, Keoskemeti said, adding samplings done at seven water plants on the lake and St. Clair River have shown no effect. City, county and state elected officials were on hand at Madison High School as representatives from the EPA, EGLE and the state Department of Health and Human Services updated residents with a briefing and answered written questions. “It was like a chemical hoarding situation,” Keoskemeti said, describing conditions inside the plant where over 5,000 chemical containers, a number of them leaking or degrading, were found inside the facility in 2017 during an initial EPA cleanup and criminal investigation. The site failed to qualify for EPA Superfund status and funding because there was no threat to drinking water and it was estimated there was a low risk of contaminates spreading from the site. The EPA cleanup nearly three years ago was done to remove the immediate hazard, Keoskemeti said, and no soil or groundwater testing was done. The site was then turned over to EGLE. EPA, other officials to brief area residents on toxic Madison Heights site Monday Owner Gary Sayers is serving a one-year federal prison sentence and has to pay $1.5 million for demolition of his three buildings at 945 E. 10 Mile Road. The city is suing him for the costs to tear down the derelict structures on his site in a civil trial that is continuing this week in Oakland County Circuit Court. State Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office and the environmental agencies are looking to see whether there are more actions they can take against Sayers. City and state officials said drinking water is unaffected and there appears to be no soil pollution beyond the former plating company site. “There’s no reason to believe contaminated groundwater has moved to the neighborhoods,” Keoskemeti said. “It’s really localized around that site.” Green liquid that leaked from a pit Sayers had dug beneath the basement was found to include toxins such as hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent, cyanide, trichloroethylene, and PFAS. Two Madison Heights residents – Jennifer Zmarzlik and Amy Lewis – have started a Facebook group called Madison Heights Clean-up, and a website, madisonheightscleanup.eco. They have researched available EPA, EGLE and other public information to inform fellow residents. Zmarzlik credited city officials with successfully pushing for action. She acknowledged being angry when she first learned of the pollution. “I feel as if we are being heard,” she said. “Fear of the unknown can create an atmosphere of negativity. We wanted to give people empowerment” with quick access to information. Three sump pumps run around the clock in the pit of the former plating building, an interceptor trench outside the building, and on the embankment to I-696, said Tricia Edwards of the EPA. More than 63,000 gallons of contaminated water has been pumped into massive frac tanks for disposal. Information on environmental remediation and updates is available online at the EPA’s website at epa.gov/mi/electro-plating-services-i696-release-site, and EGLE’s site at electro-plating services/ I-696 incident.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) FILE - In this Jan. 22, 2020, file photo, President Donald Trump leaves after a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It's been a week packed with rhetoric from President Donald Trump. This, as his Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, played out. An AP Fact Check put his statements under scrutiny and found distortions on a range of topics. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON>> Abroad, at home and in Twitter's ether, President Donald Trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the Davos economic forum played out in Switzerland. On impeachment, the state of the country, abortion, pollution and more, Trump didn't tell the story straight. A week in review: MISSILE ATTACK TRUMP, on U.S. troops targeted by the Iranian missile attack in Iraq this month: "I heard they had headaches and a couple of other things ... and I can report it is not very serious. ... No, I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I've seen. ... No, I do not consider that to be bad injuries, no." — news conference Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland. THE FACTS: That assurance is misleading at best. The Pentagon said Friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to Germany or back to the U.S. for further observation and treatment. Traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life-long debilitation or death. The severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the Pentagon; evaluation of the wounded troops continues. In the first few days after the attacks, Trump inaccurately told the nation that no American service members were hurt. ___ ABORTION TRUMP on Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va.: "The governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth." — remarks at anti-abortion rally Friday. THE FACTS: No, Northam he didn't. Trump routinely twists Northam's words, which were convoluted to begin with. Noting that late-term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive, Northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered. Then, he said, the baby would be "resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue" between doctors and the mother about what to do. In extremely rare instances, babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion. "Execution" is not an option. When a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth, a family may choose what's known as palliative care or comfort care. This might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention. Providing comfort without life-extending treatment is not specific to newborns. It may happen with fatally ill patients of any age. ___ BLUE-COLLAR 'BOOM' TRUMP: "This is a blue-collar boom. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus-47% -- three times faster than the increase for the top 1%." — remarks in Davos on Tuesday. THE FACTS: It isn't a boom for blue-collar workers. They haven't done much better than everyone else, and some of their gains under Trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing. The mining and logging industry, for example, which includes oil and gas workers, lost 21,000 jobs last year. Manufacturers have added just 9,000 jobs in the past six months, while the economy as a whole gained more than 1.1 million jobs during that period. The U.S. economy is still heavily oriented toward services. While factory jobs have grown, other jobs have grown faster, so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since Trump took office. He's right that net worth among the bottom half has risen, but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed. The Federal Reserve says the bottom half has just 1.6% of the nation's wealth, compared with 1.1% when Trump took office. It was 2.1% in 2006. ___ TRUMP: "For the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. We are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: That's not true. Wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few: The richest 1% of Americans own 32% of the nation's wealth, about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated. The middle-class share — defined by the Fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10% — remains at about 29%. This, despite the slight gains of the bottom half. The percentage of Americans who own their own homes, a key source of wealth-building, has improved modestly under Trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013. ___ OCEAN DEBRIS TRUMP: "We have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. ... We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean, where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us, and that's put there by other countries." — Davos news conference Wednesday. THE FACTS: He's right that garbage from abroad has come to U.S. shores by sea. What he does not say is that garbage from the U.S. also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that Americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores. Debris from Asia was most noticeable after the 2011 Japanese tsunami, said marine debris expert Kara Lavender Law of the Sea Education Association, "but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the U.S. and washing ashore in Asia." In fact, she said, most debris is not tracked to the country of origin. The United States produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight, Law said. "Most debris we find on the coast of the U.S. is likely from the U.S.," Denise Hardesty, a scientist who researches ocean trash for Australia's federal science organization, said by email. ___ IMPEACHMENT and UKRAINE TRUMP, on military aid to Ukraine: "Remember this, they got their money and they got it early." — interview Wednesday with Fox Business Network. TRUMP: "They got their money long before schedule." — Davos news conference. THE FACTS: They got the money months late. Congress approved nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in the early months of 2019. U.S. officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that Trump had ordered the assistance to held back, as he pressed Ukraine to announce an investigation of Democrats. It was released Sept. 11, only after a whistleblower's complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine had surfaced and a few days after Democrats in Congress opened the investigation. Previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted. ___ TRUMP, on Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the lead impeachment manager for the Senate trial: "He makes a statement that I made, and it was a total fraud. I never made it. That's why I released the conversation, because if I didn't release it, people would have said that I made the statement that he made. This guy is a fraud." — Fox interview Wednesday. THE FACTS: No, Schiff spoke after Trump released the rough transcript of his July phone call, not before. Trump's claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue. The White House released the account of the conversation on Sept. 25. Schiff gave his account on Sept. 26, while leading a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the matter, as the committee chairman. Trump has made much of Schiff's account, seizing on how the Democrat put words in Trump's mouth in describing the president's conversation with Ukraine's leader. Schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally. He said he was characterizing Trump's conversation "in not so many words," attempting to describe "the essence" of it, and doing something of a "parody." Schiff based his account on the rough transcript. He did not cause it to be released. ___ TRUMP LAWYER JAY SEKULOW, on special counsel Robert Mueller: "We had the invocation of the ghost of the Mueller report. I know something about that report. It came up empty on the issue of collusion with Russia. There was no obstruction, in fact." — impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: He's wrong to suggest that Mueller's report cleared the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia. Nor did the report exonerate Trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice. Instead, the report factually laid out instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, leaving it open for Congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once Trump leaves office. "If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so," Mueller said after the report was released. Mueller's two-year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with Russians. Among them: Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. On collusion, Mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term. He looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front. ___ SEKULOW: "During the proceedings that took place before the Judiciary Committee, the president was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses. The president was denied the right to access evidence. And the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings." — impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's false. The committee, which produced the articles of impeachment, invited Trump or his legal team to come. He declined. Absent White House representation, the hearings proceeded as things in Congress routinely do. Time was split between Democratic and Republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate. Lawyers for Democrats and Republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses, among them an academic called forward by Republicans. The first round of hearings was by the House Intelligence Committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases, conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation. Trump cried foul then at the lack of representation, then rejected representation when the next committee offered it. ___ BLACK COLLEGES TRUMP, on historically black colleges and universities: "I saved HBCUs. We saved them. They were going out and we saved them." — Davos remarks Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's a big stretch. Trump signed a law in December restoring money that lapsed for several months when Congress failed to reauthorize some $255 million in financing on time. The money came back because Senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools. Neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the Trump administration. The administration generally has supported historically black colleges, as previous administrations have done, and it's true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed. The Trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes. But this segment of university education was not vanishing. ___ AIR & WATER TRUMP: "I'm proud to report the United States has among the cleanest air and drinking water on Earth -- and we're going to keep it that way. And we just came out with a report that, at this moment, it's the cleanest it's been in the last 40 years." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, air quality has worsened under his administration. And it's a stretch to say the U.S. is among the countries with the cleanest air. Dozens of nations have less smoggy air. In the U.S. and other countries, air is better than it was during the days of full-on coal power, leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks, before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago. But by multiple measures, air quality has deteriorated in the last few years. Trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean-up of U.S. air and water a half-century ago. As to water quality, one measure, Yale University's global Environmental Performance Index, finds the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water. But after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled. There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, according to an Associated Press analysis of EPA data. And deadly air particle pollution increased 5.5% in the U.S. between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24% from 2009 to 2016, says a Carnegie Mellon University study. The Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days. ___ ECONOMY TRUMP: "We have the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country. And I'm in Europe today because we're bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs -- millions of jobs, in many cases. " — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: His persistent depiction of the U.S. economy as the greatest ever is false. As for jobs pouring into the country, investment by foreign companies has slumped under Trump, according to a report by the Organization for International Investment, a Washington-based association that represents foreign businesses. Foreign companies directly invested $268 billion into the U.S. economy in 2018, a decrease of nearly $220 billion from its record-breaking level in 2016 when Democrat Barack Obama was still president. On the broader picture, economic growth under Trump is not nearly the greatest ever. In the late 1990s, growth topped 4% for four straight years, a level it has not reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth reached 7.2% in 1984. The economy grew 2.9% in 2018 — the same pace it reached in 2015 under Obama — and hasn't hit historically high growth rates. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low of 3.5%, but the proportion of Americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s. Wages were rising at a faster pace back then, too. This much is true: The Obama-Trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. But not the greatest. ___ TRUMP: "The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any U.S. president in recorded history. We started off with a reasonably high rate." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Actually, Trump started with a rate that, if anything, was reasonably low, not "reasonably high." The unemployment rate was 4.7% when Trump replaced Obama in the White House. That is below the long-term U.S. average unemployment of 5.7% since the Labor Department began compiling the data in 1948. Obama inherited a rate of 7.8%. It remained high for years -- topping 8% for a record length of time -- but gradually fell to the below-average level Trump inherited. ___ TRADE TRUMP: "Just last week alone, the United States concluded two extraordinary trade deals — the agreement with China and the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement — the two biggest trade deals ever made." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, there have been larger trade deals. For instance, 123 countries signed the Uruguay Round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the World Trade Organization in 1994. The organization's initial membership accounted for more than 90% of global economic output, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found, and that was before China joined the organization. Also bigger: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have joined North America with Pacific Rim countries in freer trade. Trump took the U.S. out after the deal was negotiated and before the U.S. ratified it. The European Union, with its liberalized trade regimen, was itself formed from a giant deal. The China deal leaves tariffs in place on about $360 billion in imports from China and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations. Trump's U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement is much larger, though it's an update of the long-standing North American Free Trade Agreement worked out by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. ___ HOUSEHOLD INCOME TRUMP: "Real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Not really, but it would be misleading even if it were true. Real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of $63,200 first reached in 1999. That's according to adjusted figures the Census Bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time. Trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record. Either way, what the data show is that income for the median household — the one at the exact middle of the income distribution — essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years. The Census data also show that household income fell sharply after the Great Recession, then began rebounding in 2015, before Trump took office.

The road has been shut down after water from the Clinton River Middle Branch partially flooded the roadway. MITCH HOTTS -- THE MACOMB DAILY Heydenreich Road remained closed to traffic Sunday north of Cass Avenue in Clinton Township due to road flooding. MITCH HOTTS -- THE MACOMB DAILY Motorists navigate their way down Heydenreich Road north of Cass Avenue in Clinton Township. The road has been shut down after water from the Clinton River Middle Branch partially flooded the roadway. MITCH HOTTS -- THE MACOMB DAILY After a record-setting rainfall Saturday, two Macomb County wastewater facilities were forced to begin discharging millions of gallons of partially treated sewage into area waterways, according to city, county and state officials. Elsewhere, several roads that were closed for much of the weekend due to flooding from the rain and ice storms are expected to re-open to traffic starting Monday morning as another warming trend is in the forecast. According to the National Weather Service, the area broke a record for the highest single-day rainfall Saturday for the month of January with 2.06 inches of rain recorded at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The previous record was 1.76 inches on Jan. 12, 1908, said National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin Kacan. There was a chance overnight and into Monday morning for freezing drizzle, but Kacan said: "But compared to the event we had (Saturday), we are going to be quite a bit quieter around here." The heavy rains resulted in two sewage discharges in an effort to prevent basement flooding. The Chapaton retention basin, located on Lake St. Clair in St. Clair Shores, dumped in excess of 60 million gallons of combined sewer overflow, according to the Macomb County Public Works Office. Also, the Warren sewage treatment plant, which lies near 14 Mile and Van Dyke, adjacent to Bear Creek, sent an as-of-yet-uknown number of gallons of sewage-tainted water into the Red Run Drain. That water ultimately empties into the lake. Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller on Sunday said the 60 million gallons could have been reduced in half if her office could convince the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) to issue permits for an expansion project. Miller said upgrade plans would not have prevented a discharge due to the intense rainfall, the pending plans would allow the county to contain most average rain events. "It is beyond infuriating that the agency assigned to be the environmental watchdog in our state is holding up our permits," Miller said in a news release. "Another 60 million gallons of combined sewer overflow into the lake? That is not, cannon and will not be the right answer." State EGLE officials have said the Chapaton facility is providing "adequate" combined sewer treatment to the water quality under its existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Miller claims the permits are based on outdated standards. In Eastpointe and St. Clair Shores, underground sewer systems are designed to carry both sanitary sewage and storm water flow. During heavy rain events, the system becomes overwhelmed, according to the public works office. The Chapaton basin allows county operators to hold up to 30 million gallons of excess water, but once that limit is reached, it is treated with a heavy bleach solution and discharged into Lake St. Clair. The county public works office's proposed expansion would increase that capacity to about 60 million gallons. In a news release Sunday, St. Clair Shores Mayor Kip Walby said the state's refusal to issue the new permit "boggles the mind." "Under Commissioner Miller's leadership, we finally have a creative, cost effective solution that would reduce CSOs at Chapaton by about 70%, but our state environmental agency is throwing up roadblocks," St. Clair Shores Mayor Kip Walby said in a news release. The Warren sewage treatment plant began discharging about 10 p.m. Saturday, according to a report by Bryan Clor of the waste water division. As of Sunday evening, the discharging apparently was still underway. The discharge was triggered after 2.76 inches of rainfall. The sewage, which was skimmed and treated with disinfectant prior to being discharged, was emptied into the Red Run Drain, which feeds into the Clinton River and ultimately into Lake St. Clair. Communities are required by law to report overflows to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy within 48 hours, with a more detailed report to follow. Meanwhile, most Macomb County communities on Sunday dealt with ice-covered sidewalks and parking lots following Saturday's storm but traffic was generally moving at posted speeds due to thawing conditions and salted roads by crews of the Macomb County Department of Roads. The road department had about 50 trucks salting area roads late Saturday and into Sunday, according to a spokesman. Some roads remained closed due to flooded conditions, according to the roads department. Those include 24 Mile between North Avenue and Card Road; Heydenreich between Cass Avenue and Dunham; Shook Road right lane south of Jefferson Avenue; 21 Mile between Romeo Plank Road and Heydenreich; Andrews Road between Meskill Road and Logg Road; Dayton between Burman Road and Omo Road; and 27 Mile between Indian Trail Road and North Avenue The National Weather Service said a flood warning remains in effect for the North Branch of the Clinton River until further notice. At 10 a.m. Sunday, the river stage is 14.3 feet and rising. The flood stage is 15 feet. Weather forecasters say the river will rise above flood stage by late this afternoon, cresting at about 15.5 feet after midnight. The waterway is expected to start receding until Monday. Intermittent sunshine helped melt ice on the roadways, creating mostly slushy conditions on Sunday. The weather forecast calls for a high near 40 degrees Monday, falling to an overnight low of 31. Look for mostly cloudy conditions Tuesday, with a high near 46. No significant precipitation is expected until the end of the week, according to the weather service.

CITY OF STERLING HEIGHTS PHOTO Booms are placed in the Red Run Drain in Sterling Heights to prevent further distribution of suspected leaked gasoline. MACOMB COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS PHOTO The source of a 75-100 gallon petroleum spill or leak into a Warren drain remained a mystery Saturday despite investigative efforts, Macomb County officials said. The spill was discovered Friday morning in the Clinton River and traced to the underground Schoenherr Relief Drain in Warren, which was dumping the substance into the open-air Red Run Drain at their intersection just north of 14 Mile Road in Sterling Heights. Absorbent booms were placed to collect the petroleum. Public Works investigators began their work Friday and made several manned entries into the underground drain in Warren on Saturday, according to officials from Macomb County Public Works. They will continue to investigate in the hopes of determining the source. The booms will remain in place until the water "runs clear" of any petroleum, officials said in a news release. Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said in the release the incident shows how it can affect water flowing into Lake St. Clair miles away. "Here's a spill that happened in Warren and was seen in the river some five or 10 miles away on the way out to Lake St. Clair,” Miller said. Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller.

I also appreciate the work of the staffs at Clinton Township, Warren and Sterling Heights, who assisted with this response.

 The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has collected about 11,000 gallons of contaminated water from the site of a condemned plating company near I-696 in Madison Heights. Groundwater and soil samples were taken Friday from the Electro-Plating Services property on 10 Mile Road. Two weeks ago a toxic green substance seeped from site onto the freeway, alarming people throughout the region and state. The EPA reported that two sump wells installed just before Christmas have collected almost 11,000 gallons of contaminated groundwater from beneath the facility and on the highway embankment where the contamination was discovered on Dec. 20. Most of the contaminated water collected has come from a pit Electro-Plating’s owner dug in the basement to illegally store hazardous materials. Madison Heights has been dealing with the issue through the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) and the EPA. Twenty-five wells for testing were drilled on and near the site. Test results will help analysts evaluate the contamination. That work will help investigators find the extent and levels of contamination and seek a more permanent solution to protect the environment and human health, according to a news release from EGLE. Test results are expected within a week or two. More testing and investigation are likely to be based on the results of the initial analyses. EGLE on Thursday sampled water at the point where the affected sewer system surfaces at Bear Creek to determine levels of contaminants entering the creek. That water eventually flows into the Clinton River and then Lake St. Clair. Officials said those results from those sample should be available late next week. Chemicals tested for include hexavalent chromium and other heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and cyanide. Though no nearby homes or business use well water and are on the Great Lakes Water Authority system, EGLE is to test drinking water as a precaution. EGLE Director Liesl Clark said the Electro-Plating site is one of thousands of contaminated sites that need to be more fully addressed and that a formal review of EGLE’s pollution inspection procedures is underway, as requested by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. “This situation highlights a long-term challenge that we must meet,” said Clark said in a statement. “Thousands of contaminated properties exist in Michigan, many having languished for decades without appropriate assessment or cleanup. That’s unacceptable in a state surrounded by almost 20 percent of the world’s fresh surface water.” She said contaminated sites have to be cleaned up sooner. “We will start 2020 by analyzing how best to accomplish this,” Clark said. “I look forward to working with EGLE, local communities, our federal partners, and our Michigan Legislature to put measures in place to aggressively attack these problems.” The heavy green toxic liquid in Madison Heights first showed up outside the condemned site on the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. Gary Sayers, owner of the company that caused the contamination, was sentenced in November to a year in prison and to pay $1.5 million to the EPA to cover the agency’s emergency cleanup of the site a couple of years ago. Sayers over decades failed to comply with orders to legally dispose of toxic waste at the plant, illegally storing it inside thousands of containers. Over time many of them corroded and leaked.

Macomb Daily file photo In this 2015 file photo, a pipe carrying PCB-tainted oil that is being sucked out of a manhole vault on Bon Brae Street is shown. Macomb Daily file photo WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has built up the biggest backlog of unfunded toxic Superfund clean-up projects in at least 15 years, nearly triple the number that were stalled for lack of money in the Obama era, according to 2019 figures quietly released by the Environmental Protection Agency over the winter holidays. The accumulation of Superfund projects that are ready to go except for money comes as the Trump administration routinely proposes funding cuts for Superfund and for the EPA in general. The four-decade-old Superfund program is meant to tackle some of the most heavily contaminated sites in the U.S. and Trump has declared it a priority even while seeking to shrink its budget. "There hasn't been a sense of urgency," said Violet Donoghue, who has lived for 31 years on Bon Brae Street in St. Clair Shores. Toxic PCBs have poisoned some local soil, water and fish at nearby Lake St. Clair, and the neighborhood is one of the 34 Superfund sites where clean-up projects languished for lack of money in 2019. "I feel many people have been harmed, but that's only my opinion," Donoghue said. She said the last word from the EPA was that soil would be removed from the front of her house. "Now when they say they're cleaning it, I say, 'OK, give me the date,'" she said. The unfunded projects are in 17 states and Puerto Rico. They range from abandoned mines that discharged heavy metals and arsenic in the West to an old wood pulp site in Mississippi and a defunct dry cleaner that released toxic solvents in North Carolina. Congress created the Superfund program in 1980 after the Love Canal episode and other notorious pollution cases. Its intent is to hold polluters responsible for cleanup costs or provide taxpayer money when no responsible party can be identified. Trump "is focused on putting Americans first," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told a Senate environment committee early 2019. "There may be no better example than our success in the Superfund program." "We are in the process of cleaning up some of the nation's largest, most complex sites and returning them to productive use," Wheeler said then. But two former EPA officials whose work dealt with Superfund oversight said the growing backlog of stalled Superfund projects under the Trump administration, and steady or ebbing numbers of clean-up construction projects completed, point to a different picture. "They're misleading Congress and the public about the funds that are needed to really protect the public from exposure to the toxic chemicals," said Elizabeth Southerland, who worked for 30 years at EPA, including as director of science and technology in the water office, before retiring in 2017. ''It's detrimental." This is a "regulatory failure," said Judith Enck, who served as the EPA's regional northeastern U.S. administrator under President Barack Obama. Given the growing numbers of unfunded clean-up projects, "EPA should be knocking on the door of Congress and saying, give us more money to deal with the sites,'' Enck said. Asked what the EPA spent money on instead, and why the agency didn't ask Congress for more to deal with the growing backlog, EPA spokeswoman Maggie Sauerhage offered few specifics Thursday. The EPA's Superfund program "will continue to prioritize new construction projects based on which sites present the greatest risk to human health and the environment," Sauerhage said in an email. "Further, the agency maintains the authority to respond to and fund emergencies at these sites if there is an imminent threat to human health and the environment." She pointed to some areas where Trump's Superfund effort was more on par with that of his predecessors. Long-term remedial efforts to make sure contamination didn't rebound at existing Superfund sites, for example, averaged 64 a year under Trump. That compares with an average of 60 a year in Obama's last five years. But overall, the backlog of 34 unfunded projects is up from only 12 in 2016, Obama's last year. At the site of another of 2019's unfunded Superfund projects, Montana's Upper Tenmile mining region, which includes the community of Rimini and a subdivision downstream, the EPA has been providing bottled water to residents for the past decade in response to water supplies polluted by about 150 abandoned gold, lead and copper mines. Pollution still flows from the mines and into Upper Tenmile Creek more than 20 years after the area was added to the Superfund list. About 6 miles from Rimini in the rural Landmark subdivision is a huge pile of contaminated soil that was removed from residential yards. It was supposed to be hauled away but now has weeds growing over it after sitting untouched for several years, said Patrick Keim, who lives nearby. "It's a sword of Damocles hanging over us," Keim said. "It just seems counterproductive they would spend two or three million dollars re-mediating this piece of property, haul it off and stockpile it across the road and then run out of money and leave this big pile for everybody to look at." Montana environmental regulators also are involved in the cleanup but say they need the EPA to come through with money for the work to resume, since the federal agency is providing 90 percent of funding. Under Trump, the EPA has pointed to a different yardstick in declaring it was making progress on Superfund clean-ups — the number of cleaned-up sites officially deleted from the roster of more than 1,300 Superfund sites. In 2019, for instance, the EPA said it had deleted all or part of 27 sites from the official Superfund list, saying that was the most deletions since the George W. Bush administration. But deletions from the list typically reflect clean-up work done over decades and often completed on the ground years ago, meaning Trump is sometimes taking credit for work done under his predecessors. In 2018, for example, the EPA cited the seven Superfund sites fully or partially removed from the list in the previous year as a signature accomplishment of the Trump administration. Records showed the physical work was completed before Trump took office, The Associated Press reported at the time. Sauerhage, the EPA spokeswoman, did not directly respond to questions about the backlog of 34 unfunded Superfund clean-up projects. The EPA posted the total on its website without fanfare the day after Christmas. Some of the projects that are ready to start have languished for lack of money since Trump's first year in office. EPA has been one of the main focuses of Trump's efforts to cut federal regulations and oversight that he sees as burdening businesses. Trump each year has asked Congress for nearly one-third cuts in EPA's budget, and has sought much smaller cuts for Superfund. Congress has kept both levels of funding roughly even. ___ White contributed from St. Clair Shores, Michigan, and Brown from Billings, Montana.

 As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA work to clean up chemicals leaching onto the eastbound lanes in Madison Heights. DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA work to clean up chemicals leaching onto the eastbound lanes in Madison Heights. DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY Storm drains in Warren connected to Interstate 696 are not contaminated with a hazardous chemical related to the green substance which oozed from the embankment on the eastbound side of the freeway in neighboring Madison Heights, officials said. Warren Mayor Jim Fouts said inspectors assigned to the industrial pre-treatment program at the Warren Waste Water Treatment Plant checked all storm drains that potentially could have been contaminated with the green goo, and found no pollution from the spill. "Great news," Fouts said. "I emphasize they checked all drains in Warren connected to 696 and found no contamination. We also closely monitor four businesses that use hexavalent." Tests on the so-called green ooze showed levels of hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium 6, a cancer-causing chemical. It is used in industry for the chrome plating on vehicles. On Monday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced her administration is looking into additional criminal charges against the operators of the abandoned Electro-Plating Services, the industrial company in Madison Heights linked to the green ooze and chemicals leaking from the site and onto the freeway, between Dequindre Road and John R. "The ongoing situation in Madison Heights is very concerning, and further stresses the need to enforce protections that keep Michiganders safe," said Whitmer, noting that she also wants to toughen pollution inspection and enforcement efforts. She said the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has been ordered to review how the agency inspects industrial discharges. "My administration is actively reviewing all means of accountability, including further criminal charges against the polluter who caused this mess. Today I also directed EGLE to conduct a formal review of its pollution inspection procedures to strengthen enforcement and accountability," the governor said in a prepared statement. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel echoed support of Whitmer's actions, saying her office would do "everything in our power" to assist the governor's office. She also announced the formation of a new criminal unit for environmental cases. "I have recently added new resources to our Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division and am creating a Criminal Unit that will focus specifically on environmental prosecutions," she said. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led crews have been working to prevent further leaks after a flow of a green liquid substance was observed spilling through an embankment wall onto the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. They are trying to determine how much of the chemical may have leached through into groundwater, which eventually would reach Lake St. Clair. Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said Tuesday the results of testing by Warren officials is indeed good news, providing a degree of relief. “I feel very good. I certainly applaud the efforts of Mayor Fouts and his team and being extremely pro-active and doing the testing they did,” Miller said. “I think the citizens of Warren can feel a high degree of confidence that in Macomb County we take these things seriously.” Miller isn’t breathing a complete sigh of relief, however. She said the threat to waterways and Lake St. Clair continues because of chemicals that leached onto the surface and into soil. Noting the green ooze, Miller said she is troubled that EGLE told the EPA as late as last spring that chemicals weren’t migrating. “When in fact it was,” Miller said. The Macomb County public works boss believes the embankment along I-696 in the area of the ooze potentially would have to be excavated. Miller said environmental engineers from her department will continue to be on site at Electro-Plating Services as work there continues. “We are going to partner with EGLE and EPA to understand what their plan is,” she added. On Sunday, Miller expressed concern that both EGLE and the EPA "did not adequately follow through" in initial cleanup measures. She feels the property requires long-term remediation and wants to see it demolished. State officials three years ago ordered Electro-Plating Services to close after discovering hundreds of corroded drums and vats of hazardous waste on the site. The property underwent a $1.5 million environmental partial cleanup in 2017 after it was named a Superfund site. The company's owner, Gary Sayers of Bloomfield Township, pleaded guilty in February in federal court to illegal storage of hazardous waste and sentenced to serve one year in prison. He is expected to surrender to authorities in the first quarter of 2020. Sayers also was ordered to pay $1.5 million restitution. Hugh McDiarmid Jr., a spokesman for EGLE, said Monday the department is working with federal and local officials to review decades of decision-making and testing at the site. It's not known how long the fact gathering will take. "It is important to note that significant cleanup and enforcement actions have taken place over the last three years, including property condemnation, a cease-and-desist order that stopped the polluting process, a criminal conviction, and a $1.5 million-$2 million federal emergency cleanup of thousands of drums of waste and contaminated liquid," McDiarmid said in an email.

MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO According to the EPA, the agency has dispatched personnel to respond to the site to remove contamination that is migrating off the property. Those actions include: • Removing contaminated water that had leaked onto I-696 and into the catch basins of the sewer system. • Installing two sumps. The first, in the basement pit of the Electro-Plating Services building, to collect and remove water from the basement into a portable tank to prevent water from migrating off-site. The second, a collection system along the embankment wall of I-696 which has been plumbed to discharge into a frac-tank that has been placed on the shoulder of the highway. Both sumps are operational 24 hours a day. • Collecting more than 7,000 gallons of liquid from storm drains, the on-site monitoring well and the basement of the former plating facility. • Beginning an expanded assessment to determine what further actions may be necessary, including drilling test wells to evaluate how far contamination has migrated through area soil. Madison Heights officials are seeking a court order to have Sayers demolish the abandoned building. A trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 13 in Oakland County Circuit Court. Fouts noted that many industries are starting to switch to a fake paint which gives the same appearance as the use of hexavalent chromium. “The state of Michigan should mandate that hexavalent be discontinued and the use of fake paint be used as a replacement,” the mayor said. “I'm also very impressed with the effort and expertise that Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller has demonstrated in her effort to protect Macomb County from this highly toxic ooze in Oakland County.” Fouts also commended Warren Waste Treatment Director Bryan Clor for his effort to get the inspections of the storm drains started.

DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY Corroded and leaking containers with a copper cyanide label in the basement of Electro Plating. PHOTO -- MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday said her administration is looking into additional criminal charges against the operators of an abandoned Oakland County industrial company that has become known as the "green ooze" polluter due to leaking chemicals from the site. The governor issued a statement on the controversy surrounding the closed Electro-Plating Services, which has become notorious for leaking a greenish-colored chemical onto Interstate 696 in Madison Heights. She also wants to toughen pollution inspection and enforcement efforts. "The ongoing situation in Madison Heights is very concerning, and further stresses the need to enforce protections that keep Michiganders safe," Whitmer said. She added the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has been ordered to review how the agency inspects industrial dischargers. "My administration is actively reviewing all means of accountability, including further criminal charges against the polluter who caused this mess. Today I also directed EGLE to conduct a formal review of its pollution inspection procedures to strengthen enforcement and accountability," the governor said in the statement. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel echoed support of Whitmer's actions, saying her office would do "everything in our power" to assist the governor's office. She also announced the formation of a new criminal unit for environmental cases. "I have recently added new resources to our Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division and am creating a Criminal Unit that will focus specifically on environmental prosecutions," she said in the statement. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led crews have been working to prevent further leaks after a flow of a green liquid substance was observed spilling through an embankment wall onto the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. They are trying to determine how much of the chemical may have leached through into groundwater, which eventually will end up in Lake St. Clair. State officials ordered the business to close three years ago after discovering hundreds of corroded drums and vats of hazardous waste on the site. Tests on the so-called green ooze showed levels of hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium 6, a cancer-causing chemical. Electro-Plating Services underwent a $1.5 million environmental partial cleanup in 2017 after it was named a Superfund site. The company's owner, Gary Sayers, pleaded guilty in February in federal court to illegal storage of hazardous waste and sentenced to serve one year in prison. He is expected to surrender to authorities in the first quarter of 2020. Sayers was also ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution. Sterling Heights-based attorney James Thomas, who represented the Bloomfield Township man during the criminal trial, could not be reached Monday. On Sunday, Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller expressed concern that both EGLE and the EPA "did not adequately follow through" in initial cleanup measures. She feels the property requires long-term remediation and wants to see it demolished.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PHOTO The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO Erin Brockovich PHOTO FROM FACEBOOK Preliminary test results of soil and groundwater at and near the site of the “green ooze” on Interstate 696 show no risk to drinking water but high levels of multiple contaminants. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in a news release late Friday afternoon that complete data from the testing will be available after a quality control review is complete next week. Test of water in the storm sewers near the site showed levels of hexavalent chromium at 0.14 milligrams per liter. The standard for drinking water is 0.10 mg/L. Officials had previously indicated that chemical was found. The EGLE said drinking water intakes in Lake St. Clair have not been impacted. “The storm sewer eventually enters Lake St. Clair miles away,” EGLE said. “At that point, concentrations would be well below detectable levels although still a significant concern for incremental accumulation in the ecosystem.” The green liquid substance was found last Friday spilling onto the eastbound side of the freeway between John R and Dequindre roads in Madison Heights through an embankment wall. Officials learned it came from a nearby business, Electro-Plating Services on 10 Mile Road, that was shut down by the state three years ago "after inspectors discovered hundreds of corroded drums, vats and other containers of hazardous waste at the site," according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It was partially cleaned up by the EPA. Clean-up efforts at the site, near the Warren border, have begun. The EPA-conducted tests also showed high levels of contaminants in the groundwater between the building and the I-696 service drive, including chromium, trichloroethylene and cyanide – all chemicals previously used in the EPS facility, EGLE said. "Since 1967, the company used copper, tin, bronze, cadmium, nickel, chrome, gold, silver, zinc and lead for various electroplating operations, resulting in the contamination," the EPA said in 2017. Soil tests on the embankment where the green liquid appeared on the shoulder also showed hexavalent chromium, as well as multiple heavy metals and other contaminants at levels below the threshold for direct human contact, EGLE said Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller earlier Friday called the leak “life-threatening and terrifying.” Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller speaks at her office. MACOMB DAILY FILE PHOTO “The toxic waste coming from this business site in Madison Heights is life-threatening and terrifying,” Miller said in a prepared statement. “The current conditions in that business – conditions after a $1.5 million EPA-led cleanup – tells me that guidelines on how such cleanups are conducted are inadequate. The bare minimum was done on this clean up. This situation requires both immediate and long-term remediation. The building should be demolished and the surrounding soils tested and excavated. A strong advocate for clean water, Miller said the discovery “may have been a blessing in disguise as it led to the revelation of an incredibly dangerous situation at this abandoned business.” “This incident has shown that deadly chemicals from this site can leach out and have the potential of making their way all the way to Lake St. Clair and thereby entering our drinking water supply.” The incident has gained national attention. Hexavalent chromium is the same chemical found in groundwater in California that led Erin Brokovich to help a campaign building a case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in 1993 that inspired the 2000 movie, “Erin Brockovich." Brockovich posted about it Monday on her Facebook page. “Nothing like being thought of around the holiday season for 'Green Ooze,' Brockovich wrote. “We will be following up to insure the chromium doesn't contaminate any surface water bodies ... and that the ground water and soils are indeed thoroughly cleaned up.” The chemical is a carcinogen, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It is used in the industrial process to increase hardening-ability and corrosion resistance of steel. EPS and its owner, Gary Sayers, were charged with illegal operation of a hazardous waste facility by U.S. Attorneys. Sayers was sentenced in November in U.S. District Court in Detroit to one year and one day in prison. He is to begin serving early next year. The location was declared a Superfund site by the EPA. Since the spill, the grassy slope and shoulder have been fenced off, and the Couzens Road exit lane and a right lane have been closed and will remain closed indefinitely, said Diane Cross of the Michigan Department of Transportation. “There is no timetable (for the closures),” she said. “It will definitely go into January.” A pit in the basement of Electro-Plating Services in Madison Heights in December 2017. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PHOTO EGLE said the EPA conducted a cleanup of the site in 2017. It removed hazardous chemicals and pumping contaminated liquid from an earthen pit in the basement of the facility. “This clean-up addressed the immediate hazards on the site but was not intended to address all environmental impacts,” EGLE said. EGLE said that late next week the EPA will begin dozens of soil borings to help determine the extent and levels of contamination. Regulators continue to work on the site daily, including the following activities, according to EGLE: * Daily vacuuming of nearby catch basins. * Maintenance and inspection of sump pumps collecting contaminated water from both inside the facility and on the highway embankment. * Daily monitoring of air in the building using hand-held monitors. * Preparing for the impact of rain and freezing weather. EGLE said that gravel that partially filled a “basement pit at EPS following the EPA clean-up ... was saturated with green water and there was 2-3 inches of frozen water on top of the gravel. “A sump was dug into the gravel and a float-operated pump was installed. The water is being pumped into a 20,000-gallon portable tank on site,” EGLE said. “EPA contractors will continue to remove water from the basement at EPS while a long-term remedy is developed.” To report environmental emergencies, contact the Pollution Emergency Alerting System hotline 1-800-292-4706. EGLE will post updates at Electroplating Services / I-696 Incident. @JamesonCook on Twitter Jameson Cook is a multimedia journalist at The Macomb Daily.

STATE OF MICHIGAN PHOTO @JamesonCook on Twitter The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. FILE PHOTO A green liquid that leaked on to Interstate 696 in Madison Heights came from a company whose owner was recently sentenced to one year in prison for illegally operating a hazardous material facility. The liquid was found Friday afternoon oozing on to the eastbound side of the freeway near Couzens Road near the Warren border. It was determined the substance, which contained Hexavalent chromium, originated from Electro-Plating Services, 945 E. 10 Mile Road, which was shut down three years ago by what was known then as the state Department of Environmental Quality. It was later declared a Superfund site by the federal Environmental Protection Agency for illegal storage of hazardous material. The company and its owner, Gary Alfred Sayers, were charged with a crime and sentenced Nov. 5 to one year in prison in U.S. District Court in Detroit. Sayers and the company were ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution for the cost of the clean-up, which was completed in January 2018. Materials included cyanide, chromium, chloride and various acids as part of its plating process, and were stored in drums, containers and a pit dug in the ground. In the recent incident, the Michigan Department of Transportation reported a green liquid substance leaking from a retaining wall along the embankment. A liquid substance leaks on to Interstate 696 on Friday in Madison Heights. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO A HAZMAT team and local, state and federal officials responded and stopped the leak and have been conducting a clean-up and containment. Hexavalent chromium is a carcinogen that is harmful if inhaled or exposed to unprotected skin. The Couzens exit lane and ramp and the right thru-lane were closed and will remain closed until at least Friday while officials await the results of test samples to determine if other substances were also present. Jill Greenberg, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, said Monday that HAZMAT workers vacuumed storm sewers and catch basins in the area and placed a sump-pump in the business’ basement to prevent groundwater from spreading. A fence was erected on the embankment to prevent anyone from entering the contaminated area, she added. Greenberg said there has been no evidence that anyone has come into contact with the substance or that any drinking water was impacted. “There’s no imminent danger to drinking water,” she said. Some of the substance may have migrated from the area into a nearby drain and eventually into Lake St. Clair but that has not been determined. She said officials will decide the next phase of operation after the test results are learned Friday. A clean-up could involve removing the embankment in the area. State Rep. Lori Stone, D-Warren, vowed Monday to "remain vigilant" in monitoring and correcting the situation.

State Sen. Jeremy Moss, D-Southfield, and state Rep. Jim Ellison, D-Royal Oak, added in a joint statement: “Preventable situations such as this are why we must act with urgency to enforce stronger policies to hold polluters accountable and protect our residents." Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice S. Miller commended the quick response but said the incident points out the need for a coordinated monitoring plan to protect Great Lakes water quality. “Michigan EGLE and EPA were quickly on the job and engaged in this clean up on what was essentially a holiday weekend,” Miller said in a written statement. “This issue points out the need to monitor and have a means to capture the storm water off our major freeways – which amounts to millions of gallons of water per year directly entering into Lake St. Clair and the Great Lake system.” Whether Electro-Plating Services and the owner will face other sanctions has not been determined. Miller said her agency is “concerned” that the groundwater around the business was not tested, in light of the $1.5 million clean-up. “We cannot continue to operate the way that we have in the past," she said. "The Great Lakes are a world treasure, and we must work together to serve as their guardians. A single drop of this chromium 6 contamination that might enter the lake is one drop too much." Miller noted that this year Macomb County Public Works has responded to several instances of oil sheens, cement run-off and old paint entering into the county drains. MCPWO operates a 24-hour spill response emergency number, (877) 679-4337. Those who see an emergency situation may also call 911. @JamesonCook on Twitter Jameson Cook is a multimedia journalist at The Macomb Daily.

The governor of Ohio has announced a plan to help combat the toxic algae by offering farmers an incentive to change their practices, which contribute to the problem. MACOMB DAILY FILE PHOTO A look at the City of Toledo water intake crib in Lake Erie, during a summer when it was surrounded by algae. The governor of Ohio has announced a plan to help combat the toxic algae by offering farmers an incentive to change their practices, which contribute to the problem. MACOMB DAILY FILE PHOTO Ohio’s new strategy to combat the toxic algae plaguing Lake Erie will focus on reducing agriculture runoff that feeds the yearly outbreaks by offering farmers financial incentives to change their practices, Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday. The plan is the first time the state has taken such a comprehensive approach, he said, and will take on the main sources of the pollution by relying on years of research. Farmers won’t be forced to adopt any of the changes, but DeWine thinks they will buy in because of the incentives and some of the new practices that will save them money. The Republican governor said that a new strategy is needed because the state’s attempts to reduce the phosphorus that fuels the algae has not shown any improvement since 2014 — the year toxins from a bloom contaminated the water supply for more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area. “The results have not been what we wanted,” he said, mainly because the state has only spent a fraction of the money targeted for water quality on reducing farm fertilizer runoff, the biggest contributor to the algae in western Lake Erie. Just months after taking office this year, DeWine proposed putting nearly $1 billion on water quality projects over the next decade. State lawmakers this summer approved spending $172 million during the next two years for such work. DeWine’s broad plan didn’t specify how much money will go toward incentives for farmers or other projects. But he said all farmers need to make some adjustments in their operations. He said the incentives are necessary because without them it’s unlikely the farm community would be able to pay for the changes that are needed. “We can’t expect farmers to do things that will drive them out of business,” he said. “We need to help them along.” Several environmentalist groups have said that the state’s reliance on largely voluntary efforts aren’t working. A lawsuit moving through the federal court in Toledo is seeking to force the state to adopt mandatory regulations to prevent the blooms. Among the solutions the state will concentrate on are encouraging farmers to be more precise in putting fertilizer on fields, using equipment to inject manure and fertilizer in the ground, planting cover crops and adding drainage control structures. Many of the practices outlined by DeWine have been talked about or are already being adopted, but the difference now is that the state will put more money behind the approaches. The state also will begin building wetlands to filter pollutants along the Lake Erie shore and farm fields. Adam Sharp, executive vice president of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation, said what’s different about the state’s plan is that the agriculture industry came together with environmental groups to help create it. “That kind of relationship in Ohio wasn’t here before,” he said. “That’s the critical part here that creates a real, long-term opportunity for success.” DeWine said the state will monitor its progress and track how much farmland is using these new conservation practices, but he cautioned that improvements won’t happen overnight. Gail Hesse, director of the National Wildlife Federation's Great Lakes water program, said she liked that the governor’s message included the need for all farmers to participate and an informed approach to get to the solutions. “Hopefully this will be the right approach at the right scale,” she said. Algae blooms have also been a problem in Lake St. Clair and Macomb County's inland rivers. This past spring Macomb County Public Works Office in its effort to combat the problem conducted tests of drains serving five local communities to determine whether they have high levels of phosphorous, the element in fertilizers that can be harmful to streams and lakes at concentrated levels. The move was something new under the direction of Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller, who worked on efforts to reduce phosphorous levels in the Great Lakes while serving in Congress. She successfully introduced legislation to limit allowable levels of phosphorous in water runoffs from farms or other large users of fertilizers. “This initial round of testing, even though it was conducted in an off season for fertilizer use, is still great news,” Miller said, in a previous story. “It means our farmers –- not surprisingly –- take their responsibility very seriously. As we conduct additional testing, if and when we find hot spots, we can work with property owners to eliminate them.” READ FULL STORY Macomb County Public Works to check phosphorous levels A pair of new exhibits populates the Detroit Institute of Arts this weekend.

 President Donald Trump speaks at the 9th annual Shale Insight Conference at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) President Donald Trump speaks at the 9th annual Shale Insight Conference at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019, in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON>> Reality got blurred this week in a haze of claims as President Donald Trump attacked Barack Obama's climate policies. Here's a look at some of the president's statements on the subject, delivered Wednesday in Pennsylvania when he addressed an energy-industry event focused on fracking. TRUMP: "I withdrew the United States from the terrible, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. It was a total disaster for our country. ... So, we did away with that one." THE FACTS: The U.S. has not withdrawn from the accord, and it will not be out before the next election, at the earliest. According to the terms of the agreement, the first day Trump can begin the formal process of withdrawing from the 2015 landmark deal is Nov. 4, when the U.S. can submit a letter of notice to the United Nations. Withdrawing takes a year, meaning the U.S. could officially leave the day after the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election. Under the agreement, every country created and chose its own goals to reduce carbon pollution. Trump has previously said he would seek to renegotiate the deal, but the United Nations says the accord, signed by 195 countries, "cannot be renegotiated based on the request of a single party." ___ TRUMP: "We canceled the last administration's so-called clean power plan. Sounds nice, but it wasn't so nice. It was a disaster, which would have cost Americans nearly $40 billion a year and caused electricity prices to soar to double digits, while cutting coal production by almost 250 million tons." THE FACTS: He's exaggerating the cost savings from ditching the Obama-era power plan. Trump's own Environmental Protection Agency in 2017 estimated cost-savings starting as low as $2.6 billion a year and increasing to as much as $33 billion a year by 2030. That's well short of $40 billion a year. And it's only half the ledger. The $33 billion does not include an estimate of how much the benefits of Obama's plan would be worth. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2018 calculated that repeated analyses by the EPA showed that the benefits of the clean power plan usually outweighed the costs, at times by a lot. For instance, fewer illnesses and deaths turned into dollar amounts based on a formula on the value of each life. The research service noted that the EPA's 2017 report essentially said the decision to shelve Obama's rules could end up saving taxpayers as much as $14 billion a year — far from Trump's claim of $40 billion — or costing them as much as $28 billion a year. Neither extreme in that analysis supports Trump's statement. ___ TRUMP: "Our air right now and our water right now is as clean as it's been in decades. ... I'm proud that, today, the United States has among the very cleanest air and drinking water on Earth, anywhere on Earth." THE FACTS: Trump is incorrect. Air quality has not improved under the Trump administration. And it's a stretch to say the U.S. is among the countries with the cleanest air. Dozens of nations have less smoggy air. As to water quality, one measure, Yale University's global Environmental Performance Index, finds the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water. But after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled. Over the last two years, the U.S. had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier, according to federal data. There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, the four years when the U.S had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980, according to an AP analysis of EPA data. A new study this month by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that deadly air particle pollution increased 5.5% in the United States between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24.2% from 2009 to 2016. "The increase was associated with 9,700 premature deaths in 2018," the study by Karen Clay and Nicholas Muller said. "At conventional valuations, these deaths represent damages of $89 billion." The Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days. A report from the nonprofit Health Effects Institute ranked the United States 37th dirtiest out of 195 countries for ozone, also known as smog, worse than the global average for population-weighted pollution. The U.S. ranks eighth-cleanest in the deadlier category of fine particles in the air. On environmental quality overall, the Yale index put the U.S. 27th, behind a variety of European countries, Canada, Japan, Australia and more. Switzerland was No. 1.

(Macomb County Public Works Office photo) County inspectors found the pollution, believed to be old diesel fuel, near a BP gas staiton and truck stop on Mound Road, north of Interstate 696 in Warren. (Macomb County Public Works Office photo) Remediation work is set to begin near a BP gas station and truck stop on Mound Road in Warren, just north of Interstate 696, after a petroleum product was found to be leaking into the Bear Creek Drain. The Macomb County Public Works Office inspectors discovered the pollution, believed to be old diesel fuel, during an inspection. A collection trench is being dug at the gas station site to prevent any potential future pollution. It will be monitored for five years and re-evaluated at the end of that period. Work to dig the collection trench and to remove contaminated soil from along the drain will begin in the next few weeks. “We are continually inspecting our drains and we encourage the public to be an extra set of eyes for us as well,” said MCPWO Commissioner Candice Miller. “When we find a problem, we fix it.” MCPWO has worked closely with the property owner, Armada Oil & Gas, and the Michigan Dept. of Energy, Great Lakes & Environment, on the cleanup. “The property owner has been an excellent neighbor in this whole process. As soon as this issue was brought to their attention, they engaged an environmental firm to first prevent any additional damage and second to develop a long-term fix,” Miller said. At the site, dozens of monitoring wells were drilled to determine the location of the petroleum and tests were conducted on all storage tanks and fuel pumps. The BP station is among the busiest fuel points for commercial trucks in Macomb County. “We’ve been cognizant of the role this business plays in one of our chief industrial corridors in all of southeast Michigan, but at the same time, our primary goal is always to protect our waterways. What we do in the Bear Creek, and in all of our drains, has a direct impact on water quality in our magnificent Great Lakes,” Miller said. The Bear Creek Drain begins in Oakland County and runs diagonally from southwest Warren to the northeast, emptying into the Red Run Drain, north of 13 Mile Road and east of Van Dyke Avenue. About 75,000 people live in the Bear Creek drainage district. Like all drains in Macomb County, the water in the Bear Creek eventually ends up in Lake St. Clair. The Bear Creek drains about 14,000 acres of property in Warren, Center Line and in Oakland County. In total, the Bear Creek Drain runs about 11 miles in length. It was legally established in 1910. MCPWO operates a 24-hour hotline that can be called if people see pollution in a county drain.

Greenland has been melting faster in the last decade, and this summer, it has seen two of the biggest melts on record since 2012. A special United Nations-affiliated oceans and ice report released on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2019 projects three feet of rising seas by the end of the century, much fewer fish, weakening ocean currents, even less snow and ice, and nastier hurricanes, caused by climate change. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana) NEW YORK (AP) — Climate change is making the world's oceans warm, rise, lose oxygen and get more acidic at an ever-faster pace, while melting even more ice and snow, a grim international science assessment concludes. But that's nothing compared to what Wednesday's special United Nations-affiliated oceans and ice report says is coming if global warming doesn't slow down: three feet of sea rise by the end of the century, much fewer fish, weakening ocean currents, even less snow and ice, stronger and wetter hurricanes, and nastier El Ninos. "The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble and that means we're all in big trouble, too," said one of the report's lead authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. "The changes are accelerating." These changes will not just hurt the 71% of the world covered in oceans or the 10% covered in ice and snow, but it will harm people, plants, animals, food, societies, infrastructure and the global economy, according to the special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. The seas warm more slowly than the air but trap the heat longer with bigger side effects — and the report links these waters with Earth's snow and ice, called the cryosphere, because their futures are interconnected. "The world's oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe," said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report found: —Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990. —The world's oceans have already lost 1 to 3% of the oxygen in their upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues. —From 2006 to 2015 the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the world's mountain glaciers has accelerated and is now losing 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year. —Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers). —Arctic sea ice in September, the annual minimum, is down almost 13% per decade since 1979. This year's low, reported Monday, tied for the second lowest on record. If carbon pollution continues unabated, by the end of the century there will be a 10 to 35% chance each year that sea ice will disappear in the Arctic in September. —Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in general are expected to decline 21 to 24% by the end of century because of climate change. And for the first time, the international team of scientists is projecting that "some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable due to climate-related ocean and cryosphere change." The IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst case scenario by nearly four inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of increased recent melt of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between two feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters) with a most likely amount of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional one meter (39 inches) that scientists often use. "Sea level continues to rise at an increasing rate," the report said. "Extreme sea level events that are historically rare (once per century in the recent past) are projected to occur frequently (at least once per year) at many locations by 2050." And sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a "future that certainly looks completely different than what we currently have," said report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist. The Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires nations meeting this week in Monaco to unanimously approve the report, and because of that the group's reports tend to show less sea level rise and smaller harms than other scientific studies, outside experts said.

(AP Photo/Tom Copeland) "Like many of the past reports this one is conservative in the projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and Antarctica," said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland ice melt at length and wasn't part of the report. "We're not done revising our sea level rise projections and we won't be for a while." Willis said people should be prepared for sea rise to be twice these IPCC projections. The oceans have become slightly more acidic, but that will accelerate with warming. In the worst case scenario, the world is looking at a "95% increase in total acidity of the oceans," said study co-author Nathan Bindoff of the University of Tasmania. Even if warming is limited to just another couple of tenths of a degree, the world's warm water coral reefs will go extinct in some places and be dramatically different in others, the report said. "We are already seeing the demise of the warm water coral reefs," Portner said. "That is one of the strongest warning signals that we have available." The report gives projections based on different scenarios for emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. One is a world that dramatically decreases carbon pollution — and the worst case is where little has been done. We are closer to the worst-case situation, scientists said. Outside scientists praised the work, but are disturbed by it. "It is alarming to read such a thorough cataloging of all of the serious changes in the planet that we're driving," Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler, who wasn't part of the report, said in an email. "What's particularly disturbing as a scientist is that virtually all of these changes were predicted years or decades ago." Its authors emphasized that this report doesn't doom Earth to this gloomy outlook. "We indicate we have a choice. Whether we go into a grim future depends on the decisions that are being made," Portner said. "We have a better future ahead of us once we make the right choice." ___ Read more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at https://www.apnews.com/Climate Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at https://twitter.com/borenbears ___

 Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. A couple hundred Madison Heights area residents applauded several times Monday night as they learned of actions taken since a green ooze on I-696 revealed toxic contamination leaking from the former Electro-Plating Services site on 10 Mile Road. But some still have questions with no quick answers, including about whether the pollution will affect their property values. No contamination in Warren drains from green ooze, mayor says Whitmer considers more criminal charges in 'green ooze' pollution case One of the most surprising facts to come out Monday is that Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has an annual budget of only $15 million and there are 9,000 contaminated sites in southeast Michigan. The cleanup in Madison Heights is expected to cost in “the low millions” of dollars, said Tracy Keoskemeti EGLE, and the agency doesn’t have the money. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter said he was shocked to learn of the low funding level. Money is needed to tear down the three Electro-Plating Services buildings and clean up the site. Madison Heights awaits EPA timeline for cleanup of contaminated site near I-696 David Coulter calls green ooze situation a 'catastrophe' in testimony to lawmakers “I’ve promised the county will help provide the resources to tear down that building,” Coulter said. “We’re not going to let demolition costs be an impediment to the cleanup.” Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. U.S. Rep. Andy Levin said reform laws are needed so that polluters have to pay for their actions. “We have to fully fund EPA to go after corporate polluters,” he said. “We’ve got to do better.” Soil, groundwater and vapor samples thus far have not indicated contamination spreading beyond the site and immediate surroundings, according to the Environmental Protection Agency and EGLE. Testing and test results are continuing, Keoskemeti said. The ooze that spread onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20 did get into the stormwater system and Bear Creek, both of which ultimately reach Lake St. Clair. Oakland County identifies seven contaminated sites in need of assessment Testing for toxic waste from Madison Heights site expands to Hazel Park State says "green ooze" not impacting drinking water However, the contaminants were diluted enough by the time they reached the lake that it is not expected to impact water quality, Keoskemeti said, adding samplings done at seven water plants on the lake and St. Clair River have shown no effect. City, county and state elected officials were on hand at Madison High School as representatives from the EPA, EGLE and the state Department of Health and Human Services updated residents with a briefing and answered written questions. “It was like a chemical hoarding situation,” Keoskemeti said, describing conditions inside the plant where over 5,000 chemical containers, a number of them leaking or degrading, were found inside the facility in 2017 during an initial EPA cleanup and criminal investigation. The site failed to qualify for EPA Superfund status and funding because there was no threat to drinking water and it was estimated there was a low risk of contaminates spreading from the site. The EPA cleanup nearly three years ago was done to remove the immediate hazard, Keoskemeti said, and no soil or groundwater testing was done. The site was then turned over to EGLE. EPA, other officials to brief area residents on toxic Madison Heights site Monday Owner Gary Sayers is serving a one-year federal prison sentence and has to pay $1.5 million for demolition of his three buildings at 945 E. 10 Mile Road. The city is suing him for the costs to tear down the derelict structures on his site in a civil trial that is continuing this week in Oakland County Circuit Court. State Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office and the environmental agencies are looking to see whether there are more actions they can take against Sayers. City and state officials said drinking water is unaffected and there appears to be no soil pollution beyond the former plating company site. “There’s no reason to believe contaminated groundwater has moved to the neighborhoods,” Keoskemeti said. “It’s really localized around that site.” Green liquid that leaked from a pit Sayers had dug beneath the basement was found to include toxins such as hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent, cyanide, trichloroethylene, and PFAS. Two Madison Heights residents – Jennifer Zmarzlik and Amy Lewis – have started a Facebook group called Madison Heights Clean-up, and a website, madisonheightscleanup.eco. They have researched available EPA, EGLE and other public information to inform fellow residents. Zmarzlik credited city officials with successfully pushing for action. She acknowledged being angry when she first learned of the pollution. “I feel as if we are being heard,” she said. “Fear of the unknown can create an atmosphere of negativity. We wanted to give people empowerment” with quick access to information. Three sump pumps run around the clock in the pit of the former plating building, an interceptor trench outside the building, and on the embankment to I-696, said Tricia Edwards of the EPA. More than 63,000 gallons of contaminated water has been pumped into massive frac tanks for disposal. Information on environmental remediation and updates is available online at the EPA’s website at epa.gov/mi/electro-plating-services-i696-release-site, and EGLE’s site at electro-plating services/ I-696 incident.

 As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA worked to clean up chemicals that leaked from a former Electro-Plating Service building onto the eastbound shoulder in Madison Heights several days before Christmas. The cleanup work and analysis continues and EPA and state EGLE officials are updating area residents at a public meeting Monday. As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA worked to clean up chemicals that leaked from a former Electro-Plating Service building onto the eastbound shoulder in Madison Heights several days before Christmas. The cleanup work and analysis continues and EPA and state EGLE officials are updating area residents at a public meeting Monday. Experts from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy are set to meet with Madison Heights area residents to answer questions about the contaminated Electro-Plating Services site. The meeting is at 6 p.m. Monday at the Madison Heights High School, 915 E. 11 Mile Road. State Rep. Jim Ellison and other city, county, state and national officials, including U.S Rep. Andy Levin, said they are attending the meeting. “People from the EPA and EGLE are going to update the community on what they’ve found at the site and how long it’s going to take to clean it up,” Ellison said. “There are a lot of fingers being pointed now, which is counterproductive. We’ll have plenty of time to find the cause and who did what, but we want the cleanup first.” Gary Sayers, owner of the plating company that included three rundown buildings at 945. E. 10 Mile, began serving a one-year federal prison term last month. He was also fined $1.5 million to pay EPA costs at his buildings incurred before a toxic green substance leaked onto I-696 near his building Dec. 20, requiring more cleanup efforts. Meantime, Madison Heights is suing Sayers in Oakland County Circuit Court to pay demolition and cleanup costs for his three buildings. “People are angry, and understandably so,” Ellison said. “This is just one of 7,000 contaminated sites in the state. The primary task is to get it cleaned up and get the money to pay for it.” The state Legislature is set to introduce legislation Monday aimed at making it easier to enforce cleanup fines and penalties against environmental polluters. Ellison and Madison Heights Mayor Brian Hartwell said EGLE and EPA officials have been responsive and updated elected and other officials with weekly meetings since Dec. 20. The green viscous liquid from the site that oozed I-696 was found to contain hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent, cyanide, and trichloroethylene. “I have a lot of trust in the state officials because they are being honest and have worked with us since this problem bubbled up, so to speak,” Hartwell said. The mayor’s campaign committee recently paid to mail EPA and EGLE updates on the contaminated site to a couple thousand residents who live in the area. The EPA several days ago said it has taken 29 soil samples and 33 groundwater samples from temporary monitoring wells. No traces of pollutants exceeding metrics for safe levels were found in the groundwater samples. Data on soil samples is pending, according to the EPA. The contaminants have no effect on local drinking water or soil beyond the site area, city officials said. EPA workers have collected more than 48,000 gallons of liquid from storm drains, anon-site monitoring well and the basement of the former plating company. Funding for cleaning up polluted sites like the former Electro-Plating location is a major hurdle, Harwell added. “Even if they hired 100 new site inspectors today there would still be a backlog,” he said. Records show Sayers received 15 warnings or violations from environmental officials for operations at his plant starting over two decades ago. There were also subsequent court orders against him and several informant complaints before he was finally charged and convicted in U.S District Court in Detroit last year. Federal prosecutors said Sayers illegally stored thousands of containers of hazardous waste rather than disposing of them legally. He also stored toxic waste in a five-foot-deep pit dug beneath the floor of the basement, prosecutors said. Pollutants from that pit are what mixed with rain and ground water before seeping out onto the shoulder of eastbound I-696 shortly before Christmas. The property was declared a Superfund site by the EPA and a first cleanup was completed in early 2018. Other officials at Monday’s meeting will include State Sen. Jeremy Moss, Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter, county Water Resources Commissioner Jim Nash, Oakland County Commissioner Gary McGillivray of Madison Heights, and representatives from the state Department of Health and Human Services. EPA and EGLE representatives will answer questions from residents after their presentation. “I think the majority of questions will be about exposure to chemicals and soil contamination, said Madison Heights City Manager Melissa Marsh. “Residents have asked the city those questions and also about the EPA and EGLE and why (the site) wasn't inspected more. This meeting is a chance for residents to turn out in a united front and show that we want this site cleaned up.” Here is a look at some of the stories you may have missed from the past week:

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) FILE - In this Jan. 22, 2020, file photo, President Donald Trump leaves after a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It's been a week packed with rhetoric from President Donald Trump. This, as his Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, played out. An AP Fact Check put his statements under scrutiny and found distortions on a range of topics. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON>> Abroad, at home and in Twitter's ether, President Donald Trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the Davos economic forum played out in Switzerland. On impeachment, the state of the country, abortion, pollution and more, Trump didn't tell the story straight. A week in review: MISSILE ATTACK TRUMP, on U.S. troops targeted by the Iranian missile attack in Iraq this month: "I heard they had headaches and a couple of other things ... and I can report it is not very serious. ... No, I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I've seen. ... No, I do not consider that to be bad injuries, no." — news conference Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland. THE FACTS: That assurance is misleading at best. The Pentagon said Friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to Germany or back to the U.S. for further observation and treatment. Traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life-long debilitation or death. The severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the Pentagon; evaluation of the wounded troops continues. In the first few days after the attacks, Trump inaccurately told the nation that no American service members were hurt. ___ ABORTION TRUMP on Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va.: "The governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth." — remarks at anti-abortion rally Friday. THE FACTS: No, Northam he didn't. Trump routinely twists Northam's words, which were convoluted to begin with. Noting that late-term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive, Northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered. Then, he said, the baby would be "resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue" between doctors and the mother about what to do. In extremely rare instances, babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion. "Execution" is not an option. When a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth, a family may choose what's known as palliative care or comfort care. This might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention. Providing comfort without life-extending treatment is not specific to newborns. It may happen with fatally ill patients of any age. ___ BLUE-COLLAR 'BOOM' TRUMP: "This is a blue-collar boom. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus-47% -- three times faster than the increase for the top 1%." — remarks in Davos on Tuesday. THE FACTS: It isn't a boom for blue-collar workers. They haven't done much better than everyone else, and some of their gains under Trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing. The mining and logging industry, for example, which includes oil and gas workers, lost 21,000 jobs last year. Manufacturers have added just 9,000 jobs in the past six months, while the economy as a whole gained more than 1.1 million jobs during that period. The U.S. economy is still heavily oriented toward services. While factory jobs have grown, other jobs have grown faster, so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since Trump took office. He's right that net worth among the bottom half has risen, but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed. The Federal Reserve says the bottom half has just 1.6% of the nation's wealth, compared with 1.1% when Trump took office. It was 2.1% in 2006. ___ TRUMP: "For the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. We are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: That's not true. Wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few: The richest 1% of Americans own 32% of the nation's wealth, about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated. The middle-class share — defined by the Fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10% — remains at about 29%. This, despite the slight gains of the bottom half. The percentage of Americans who own their own homes, a key source of wealth-building, has improved modestly under Trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013. ___ OCEAN DEBRIS TRUMP: "We have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. ... We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean, where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us, and that's put there by other countries." — Davos news conference Wednesday. THE FACTS: He's right that garbage from abroad has come to U.S. shores by sea. What he does not say is that garbage from the U.S. also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that Americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores. Debris from Asia was most noticeable after the 2011 Japanese tsunami, said marine debris expert Kara Lavender Law of the Sea Education Association, "but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the U.S. and washing ashore in Asia." In fact, she said, most debris is not tracked to the country of origin. The United States produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight, Law said. "Most debris we find on the coast of the U.S. is likely from the U.S.," Denise Hardesty, a scientist who researches ocean trash for Australia's federal science organization, said by email. ___ IMPEACHMENT and UKRAINE TRUMP, on military aid to Ukraine: "Remember this, they got their money and they got it early." — interview Wednesday with Fox Business Network. TRUMP: "They got their money long before schedule." — Davos news conference. THE FACTS: They got the money months late. Congress approved nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in the early months of 2019. U.S. officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that Trump had ordered the assistance to held back, as he pressed Ukraine to announce an investigation of Democrats. It was released Sept. 11, only after a whistleblower's complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine had surfaced and a few days after Democrats in Congress opened the investigation. Previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted. ___ TRUMP, on Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the lead impeachment manager for the Senate trial: "He makes a statement that I made, and it was a total fraud. I never made it. That's why I released the conversation, because if I didn't release it, people would have said that I made the statement that he made. This guy is a fraud." — Fox interview Wednesday. THE FACTS: No, Schiff spoke after Trump released the rough transcript of his July phone call, not before. Trump's claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue. The White House released the account of the conversation on Sept. 25. Schiff gave his account on Sept. 26, while leading a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the matter, as the committee chairman. Trump has made much of Schiff's account, seizing on how the Democrat put words in Trump's mouth in describing the president's conversation with Ukraine's leader. Schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally. He said he was characterizing Trump's conversation "in not so many words," attempting to describe "the essence" of it, and doing something of a "parody." Schiff based his account on the rough transcript. He did not cause it to be released. ___ TRUMP LAWYER JAY SEKULOW, on special counsel Robert Mueller: "We had the invocation of the ghost of the Mueller report. I know something about that report. It came up empty on the issue of collusion with Russia. There was no obstruction, in fact." — impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: He's wrong to suggest that Mueller's report cleared the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia. Nor did the report exonerate Trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice. Instead, the report factually laid out instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, leaving it open for Congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once Trump leaves office. "If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so," Mueller said after the report was released. Mueller's two-year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with Russians. Among them: Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. On collusion, Mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term. He looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front. ___ SEKULOW: "During the proceedings that took place before the Judiciary Committee, the president was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses. The president was denied the right to access evidence. And the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings." — impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's false. The committee, which produced the articles of impeachment, invited Trump or his legal team to come. He declined. Absent White House representation, the hearings proceeded as things in Congress routinely do. Time was split between Democratic and Republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate. Lawyers for Democrats and Republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses, among them an academic called forward by Republicans. The first round of hearings was by the House Intelligence Committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases, conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation. Trump cried foul then at the lack of representation, then rejected representation when the next committee offered it. ___ BLACK COLLEGES TRUMP, on historically black colleges and universities: "I saved HBCUs. We saved them. They were going out and we saved them." — Davos remarks Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's a big stretch. Trump signed a law in December restoring money that lapsed for several months when Congress failed to reauthorize some $255 million in financing on time. The money came back because Senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools. Neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the Trump administration. The administration generally has supported historically black colleges, as previous administrations have done, and it's true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed. The Trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes. But this segment of university education was not vanishing. ___ AIR & WATER TRUMP: "I'm proud to report the United States has among the cleanest air and drinking water on Earth -- and we're going to keep it that way. And we just came out with a report that, at this moment, it's the cleanest it's been in the last 40 years." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, air quality has worsened under his administration. And it's a stretch to say the U.S. is among the countries with the cleanest air. Dozens of nations have less smoggy air. In the U.S. and other countries, air is better than it was during the days of full-on coal power, leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks, before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago. But by multiple measures, air quality has deteriorated in the last few years. Trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean-up of U.S. air and water a half-century ago. As to water quality, one measure, Yale University's global Environmental Performance Index, finds the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water. But after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled. There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, according to an Associated Press analysis of EPA data. And deadly air particle pollution increased 5.5% in the U.S. between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24% from 2009 to 2016, says a Carnegie Mellon University study. The Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days. ___ ECONOMY TRUMP: "We have the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country. And I'm in Europe today because we're bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs -- millions of jobs, in many cases. " — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: His persistent depiction of the U.S. economy as the greatest ever is false. As for jobs pouring into the country, investment by foreign companies has slumped under Trump, according to a report by the Organization for International Investment, a Washington-based association that represents foreign businesses. Foreign companies directly invested $268 billion into the U.S. economy in 2018, a decrease of nearly $220 billion from its record-breaking level in 2016 when Democrat Barack Obama was still president. On the broader picture, economic growth under Trump is not nearly the greatest ever. In the late 1990s, growth topped 4% for four straight years, a level it has not reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth reached 7.2% in 1984. The economy grew 2.9% in 2018 — the same pace it reached in 2015 under Obama — and hasn't hit historically high growth rates. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low of 3.5%, but the proportion of Americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s. Wages were rising at a faster pace back then, too. This much is true: The Obama-Trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. But not the greatest. ___ TRUMP: "The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any U.S. president in recorded history. We started off with a reasonably high rate." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Actually, Trump started with a rate that, if anything, was reasonably low, not "reasonably high." The unemployment rate was 4.7% when Trump replaced Obama in the White House. That is below the long-term U.S. average unemployment of 5.7% since the Labor Department began compiling the data in 1948. Obama inherited a rate of 7.8%. It remained high for years -- topping 8% for a record length of time -- but gradually fell to the below-average level Trump inherited. ___ TRADE TRUMP: "Just last week alone, the United States concluded two extraordinary trade deals — the agreement with China and the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement — the two biggest trade deals ever made." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, there have been larger trade deals. For instance, 123 countries signed the Uruguay Round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the World Trade Organization in 1994. The organization's initial membership accounted for more than 90% of global economic output, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found, and that was before China joined the organization. Also bigger: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have joined North America with Pacific Rim countries in freer trade. Trump took the U.S. out after the deal was negotiated and before the U.S. ratified it. The European Union, with its liberalized trade regimen, was itself formed from a giant deal. The China deal leaves tariffs in place on about $360 billion in imports from China and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations. Trump's U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement is much larger, though it's an update of the long-standing North American Free Trade Agreement worked out by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. ___ HOUSEHOLD INCOME TRUMP: "Real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Not really, but it would be misleading even if it were true. Real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of $63,200 first reached in 1999. That's according to adjusted figures the Census Bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time. Trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record. Either way, what the data show is that income for the median household — the one at the exact middle of the income distribution — essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years. The Census data also show that household income fell sharply after the Great Recession, then began rebounding in 2015, before Trump took office. WASHINGTON>> President Donald Trump systematically fabricated his record before boisterous supporters and the eyes of the world this past week.

 The Oakland County Brownfield Consortium has identified this property, located at 30250 Grand River Avenue, in Farmington Hills, as one of seven that needs to be assessed for potential contamination in the current fiscal year.

Environmental concerns include petroleum products from a leaking underground storage tank and hazardous substances from former auto repair use. The Oakland County Brownfield Consortium is seeking $600,000 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to help assess contaminated properties. The Fiscal Year 2020 EPA Assessment Coalition grant would be used to conduct assessments of some of the county's most polluted properties, often referred to as brownfields. More than 1,000 of these properties are located within the county with many of them located along three corridors including 8 Mile, John R., and Telegraph roads. Some of these vacant sites include remnants of manufacturing facilities that were once reliant on the automotive industry, but closed during the recession. Other sites, which housed gas stations, auto repair shops, and car dealerships have challenged local governments to find creative uses that will foster economic growth. Brad Hansen, the county's brownfield program manager, said the grant funding is used to conduct environmental site investigations and baseline environmental assessments. "These dollars are used for environmental testing, not remediation, to determine what contaminants are on the sites, if any," he said. "The grant will also be used to look into the history of the property and its neighbors to see if there any reason to be concerned. We target these three areas because, historically, they've had some contamination. We have a pretty good belief that many of the properties are contaminated." In 2009, Oakland County created the consortium to attract federal dollars to help communities assess and clean up the polluted sites while fostering economic growth. The consortium is comprised of the county and six communities including Farmington Hills, Pontiac, Ferndale, Hazel Park, Southfield, and Farmington Hills. Oakland County Executive David Coulter said all legal remedies should be used against a local business owner cited for causing an environmenta… FY 2020 Oakland County EPA Assessment Coalition Grant The county's target areas for assessment include: In November, the coalition met to discuss the county's current inventory of brownfield properties, evaluate additional properties for inclusion, and prioritize the sites for assessment. As part of this process, Hansen said each of the six coalition communities nominate a brownfield property that may be of concern to residents. "These sites are an idea of what the money could be used for," he said. "Just because these sites are identified on the grant application, that doesn't mean we have to spend money on them. If there isn't a prime reason to spend money on a site, we may not do it. If a community definitely wants to get a site taken care of, it's going to be a top priority for us here at the county." Here's a list of the priority brownfield sites identified by the coalition for Fiscal Year 2020: Last week, Oakland County Executive David Coulter testified before the House Appropriations Committee in Lansing. The testimony was focused on how the county will work with local, state, and federal officials to comprehensively remediate the "green ooze" chemical spill originating from defunct Electro-Plating Services, located in Madison Heights along 10 Mile just south of I-696. Local, state, and federal officials will host a public briefing to discuss the "green ooze" spill from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 5, at Madison High School, 915 E. 11 Mile Road. Madison Heights officials are hoping to soon get an idea from the Environmental Protection Agency on how long it will take to cleanup up a contaminated site that caused a toxic green substance to ooze onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 two weeks ago. Madison Heights officials are hoping to soon get an idea from the Environmental Protection Agency on how long it will take to cleanup up a contaminated site that caused a toxic green substance to ooze onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 two weeks ago. The Oakland County Board of Commissioners has approved a brownfield redevelopment plan for a 26-acre property in Novi.

 The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. @MarkCavitt on Twitter The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. Contamination from the "green ooze" spill is not impacting drinking water. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) reported that preliminary test results indicate that contamination from the polluted Madison Heights Electro-Plating Services facility are neither impacting groundwater nor moving southward from the site. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tested groundwater from south of E. 10 Mile Road in Hazel Park, the opposite direction from the I-696 freeway embankment where contaminants were discovered seeping onto the shoulder Dec. 20. Those tests detected no trichlorethylene (TCE) and no hexavalent chromium, the chemicals found in the "green ooze." Results of soil samples taken from the same locations are pending. Oakland County Executive David Coulter said all legal remedies should be used against a local business owner cited for causing an environmenta… Testing from the toxic Electro-Plating Services site in Madison Height expanded into Hazel Park this week. Testing from the toxic Electro-Plating Services site in Madison Height expanded into Hazel Park this week. Additionally, water systems that draw their water from Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River, downstream from the contamination, have tested their water as a precaution. They show levels of hexavalent chromium, the chemical that gave the highway liquid its green color, less than 1/1,000th of the drinking water standard. On Friday morning, test results from the Madison Heights municipal water system showed no contaminants exceeding drinking water standards, a consultant for the city reported. Tests from other water systems are pending. The EPA has launched an interactive map that displays preliminary test results for trichlorethylene (TCE), hexavalent chromium, and cyanide. The map will continue to be updated as new sampling becomes available. The public is invited to attend a community briefing, being held from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Madison High School, 915 E. 11 Mile Rd, on Monday, Feb. 3. Local, state, and federal officials will update residents on the "green ooze" situation. The event is hosted by Oakland County Executive David Coulter, Congressman Andy Levin, State Rep. Jim Ellison, State Sen. Jeremy Moss.

He spoke about the toxic chemical spill in Madison Heights that has prompted local, state, and federal officials to respond. Oakland County Executive David Coulter said all legal remedies should be used against a local business owner cited for causing an environmental mess.

Coulter was joined by Kathy Forzley, the county's director of health and human services. He spoke about putting the public's safety first, emphasizing that more tests need to be done, passing state polluter laws to hold those accountable who cause toxic spills, and how the county will work with Madison Heights to demolish the building in order to fully clean up the property. “Oakland County stands ready to work with the City of Madison Heights on options for the demolition that must occur before the site can be fully cleaned up,” he said. "Additional evaluation is helpful as a comprehensive remediation plan is developed."

Madison Heights officials are hoping to soon get an idea from the Environmental Protection Agency on how long it will take to cleanup up a contaminated site that caused a toxic green substance to ooze onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 two weeks ago. House Appropriations Committee Coulter Testimony on Contamination Last month, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) was made aware of toxic chemicals pouring out onto the shoulder of eastbound I-696. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently conducted soil and groundwater tests, with results pending, to understand how far the toxic chemicals have traveled and to prevent future leaks. Local and state officials have reassured residents living nearby that drinking water quality has not been impacted by the chemical spill, which will eventually end up in Lake St. Clair, according to the EPA. Tests on the chemicals showed levels of hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium 6, a cancer-causing chemical. Coulter said he would like to see deeper soil and aquifer testing conducted to ensure the contamination has not reached below the ground's clay layer. He also called for deeper monitoring wells so that the groundwater flow direction of the deeper aquifers could be determined. "Testing is needed for a significant distance along service lines such as sewers, electrical chases, natural gas runs, and any area such as these where the groundwater will follow because of disturbances in the natural soil," he said. EGLE also took water samples from nearby storm sewers and from Bear Creek, where the sewer water emerges and becomes surface water. Results, including for PFAS, should be available this week. In February 2019, Gary Sayers, the owner of Electro-Plating Services, was sentenced to one year in federal prison for storing hazardous waste at his business. He's now being sued by the City of Madison Heights to have him demolish the building. The city also is seeking the rights to demolish the building if Sayers does not comply with a court order to do so. Coulter said it's vital that Sayers is held accountable for this "chemical catastrophe." "It is outrageous that Mr. Sayers, the business owner, for decades operated an electroplating business in such an irresponsible nearly unbelievable manner including initiating the disposal of dangerous chemicals in a dirt pit," he said. "The fact that he is in prison is small comfort given the long and expensive road ahead to address his criminal behavior." Earlier this month, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for the State Legislature to draft and pass polluter laws that would force individuals and businesses causing hazardous spills to pay for the clean up. In addition, Whitmer said her administration is actively reviewing further criminal charges against Sayers.
