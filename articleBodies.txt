 The Dow Chemical Co. will pay to clean up six areas of contaminated sediment in the Tittabawassee River as part of a new agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The pollution is in the three-mile stretch of the river that is adjacent to Dow’s Michigan Operations site. It is the first segment in what the EPA expects to be a series of upstream-to-downstream cleanup projects. Unlike high levels of dioxin found in other areas of the river, this segment contains arsenic, chlorobenzenes, chlorophenols and more that were released by Dow. In three of the six areas, cleanup also will take place for dense non-aqueous phase liquid, or DNAPL, which the EPA said is a heavy liquid made up of materials that do not mix with water and sink to the bottom of the river. The planned work and previously released cost estimates are as follows: • Area 1: Place a clean cap over contaminated sediment to isolate and stabilize the sediment. Cost: $250,000. • Areas 2 and 3: Remove and treat DNAPL, isolate contaminated sediment with sheet pile and a cap and capture water within the sediment and treat it. Cost: $1.8 million. • Areas 4 and 5: Place a clean cap over contaminated sediment to prevent erosion. Cost: $600,000. • Area 6: Dredge and dispose of sediment contaminated by ethyl parathion; remove and treat DNAPL; isolate remaining contaminated sediment with sheet pile and a cap; and capture water within the sediment and treat it. Cost: $3.1 million. “Materials will be treated and disposed at approved locations, sites will be monitored during and after the cleanup and the cleanup systems will operate and be maintained,” the EPA stated in an e-mail announcing the new agreement. Mary Logan, EPA remedial project manager, previously said the cleanup would prevent chemicals on the surface from harming small invertebrates or contaminating areas downstream if the sediment was disturbed. Dow spokeswoman Mary Draves said the company remains focused on moving toward a resolution. “Now that the plan for segment 1 has been finalized we will begin to conduct work as outlined in the agreement,” Draves said in an e-mail. “This, along with other work we have conducted, is part of our continued work with both the EPA and MDEQ towards progress on implementation of our agreement.” Visit www.epa.gov/region5/cleanup/dowchemical for more information about the Superfund site.

 Tony Lascariof the Daily News Replacing contaminated soil, cleaning homes and paving roads in Saginaw's Riverside Boulevard neighborhood are all meant to prevent residents from being exposed to dioxins and furans. But, it's possible the work will need to be repeated in the future because the Tittabawassee River regularly floods the area containing 11 homes. The Dow Chemical Co. and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed to cleanup work in July, and officials involved recognize there are limitations. "It's going to reflood; it's going to recontaminate to some extent," said Al Taylor, a Michigan Department of Environmental Quality geologist. It is unclear how fast, and at what level, contamination will return, Taylor said. He said previous cleanup sites have varied from having little to "significant" recontamination following flooding. A monitoring system needs to be developed to make sure contamination levels do not rise to current levels, Taylor said. He said action would have to be taken if levels rise to where they become a problem again. With work taking place to remove contamination upriver of the neighborhood, officials hope recontamination can be prevented. Dow's 1,900-acre chemical manufacturing plant in Midland was a source of dioxins and furans, which are byproducts from the manufacture of chlorine-based products. Dow spokesman John Musser has said the contamination found in the Saginaw neighborhood is thought to have been the result of releases from pre-World War I operations. Jeff Kimble, on scene coordinator with EPA Region 5, said the houses are unique because they regularly flood, as opposed to other houses along the river that generally are built above the floodplain. Detailed sampling of the neighborhood was triggered by one initial sample that contained 5,900 parts per trillion of dioxin and dioxin-like compounds. The testing found more than 10,000 parts per trillion in surface soils in the neighborhood. Kimble said samples taken indoors indicate the contaminants are being tracked indoors. In the yards, two feet of soil will be removed from the riverbank to Riverside Boulevard and replaced with fresh soil and vegetation. The dirt road, which creates dust in dry periods, will be paved. "Dow has been steadfastly working out there," Kimble said, with a goal of finishing by Oct. 15. Four other areas of concern that have a higher priority for the EPA also are being examined to determine contamination levels in residential soil. Kimble said those properties do not have houses as close to the floodplain, like the Riverside Drive neighborhood does.

 JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer France, stung by oil tanker disasters that soiled its seas and beaches, is moving to protect one its most precious maritime resources _ the Mediterranean _ with stiff new punishments for polluters. The measures, adopted last week by the French parliament in a rare show of unanimity, will create an environmental protection zone off southern France's Mediterranean coast, whose sun-drenched waters and beaches draw hordes of tourists every year. World Wildlife Fund oceanographer Denis Ody welcomed the effort but said France must strengthen policing in the Mediterranean to make it effective. "This law is a good idea but will work only if accompanied by the financial and human means to have it taken seriously," he said Monday from the southern port city of Marseille. The measures, which President Jacques Chirac is expected to sign soon, are directed at shippers deliberately dumping oil, garbage and other pollutants in the Mediterranean. It seeks to punish them even when they are outside French territorial waters. Under the law, France will create an ecological protection zone extending up to 90 miles from its Mediterranean coast. France says it does not need the approval of neighboring countries to implement the new measures, though other Mediterranean nations it has contacted generally welcomed the idea. The Mediterranean is a major world shipping route linking the Atlantic Ocean with the Suez Canal. About a quarter of global oil traffic goes through the Mediterranean, according to French government figures. In 1999, the sinking of a 25-year-old tanker called the Erika spilled 3 million gallons of oil that washed up on France's Atlantic beaches. Another oil spill last year off northwestern Spain added urgency to French and European efforts to tighten maritime safety laws. The Prestige disgorged millions of gallons of oil when it broke up and sank in November, polluting Spanish and French coasts and shutting down fisheries. But French authorities say the washing out of ballast, oil and fuel tanks, the dumping of garbage at sea and similar practices cause more pollution than shipping accidents. "It's this deliberate pollution that is the main target" of the new measures, said Tokia Saifi, France's secretary of state for sustainable development, when she presented the proposals to lawmakers Thursday. Ships flush their tanks at sea because it is cheaper and quicker than doing so in port, and because few ports have tank-washing facilities, Ody said. Studies suggest 225 million gallons of oil and fuel are flushed into the Mediterranean each year this way, he said. "It's a chronic problem," Ody said. Captains of ships caught washing out oil tanks in the zone risk fines of up to $600,000. Their vessels could be seized until the fine is paid, French government officials said. Captains of French ships caught polluting the zone also risk up to four years in prison. The government expects the law to take effect before the summer, when sun-loving tourists descend on Mediterranean beaches en masse.

 DAVE BRYAN Associated Press Writer David Baker remembers the upheaval in his hometown of Anniston in the 1990s when many residents realized their health and property had been contaminated by toxic PCBs from a nearby chemical plant. The experience spurred Baker and others in predominantly poor, black west Anniston to form Community Against Pollution to fight for damages and clean up the contamination. Today, most of the group's members have been involved in lawsuits against the chemical company. "It was just something you could not believe in these days and times to see the people who suffered behind this," Baker recalled. Like Baker, citizens in many poor, black communities around Alabama and the South in recent years have fought companies who have located pollution-spewing industrial plants, hazardous landfills and waste incinerators near homes and schools. Known as "environmental racism," the practice of locating such toxic operations near politically powerless blacks has been stymied by the emerging citizen groups. "Companies now don't just bully in," said Robert Bullard, sociology professor at Clark Atlanta University. "When they do, they're in for a rude awakening. There is no path of least resistance any more." Bullard, author of "Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class and Environmental Quality," said many members of watchdog groups are involved in lawsuits seeking massive damage judgments. Over time, as low-income neighborhoods in Southern towns became more racially mixed, poor people, white and black, joined in the fight, Bullard said. They often run up against business and civic leaders working to develop communities economically. To the developers, such projects often bring in badly needed jobs and revenues for areas that sometimes have little of either. Larry Lee, a spokesman for a company that reopened a landfill in east Alabama last year, said many supported the project, which brought about 35 jobs to a rural community in Tallapoosa County. But in 2000, a company that planned to build Alabama's biggest solid waste landfill withdrew its proposal after the Rev. Jesse Jackson joined residents to oppose the dump in predominantly black and poor Macon County. The landfill would have covered 700 to 800 acres near the town of Shorter and accepted up to 5,000 tons of trash a day from around the South. But Milton McGregor, a white who is a dog track magnate and property owner, withdrew the application after meeting with Jackson and other leaders, and a day before the county commission was to vote on it. Bullard said environmental racism has its roots in the segregationist era in the South when racially segregated schools were legal and building paved roads or parks in black communities was optional. As the New South began to take shape following World War II, politicians in many Southern towns wanted to create jobs and bring in tax revenues to grow local economies. "In many cases (the South) would accept things that other regions would say no to," Bullard said. "Race was a major player in determining where these facilities went in and how they were operated." Many companies moved projects such as waste incinerators and petrochemical plants out of the crowded Northeast. Typical was Sumter County in Alabama, where the nation's largest hazardous waste landfill was built at Emelle in 1978. The 3,200-acre waste treatment, storage and disposal facility came to the predominantly black county during a period when few blacks held public office there. The disposal site, run by Waste Management Inc., created jobs in the area, but it received some of the most hazardous wastes from Superfund sites in the United States and from foreign countries. It handled nearly 800,000 tons of hazardous waste at its peak in 1989 until state officials began to see its negative impact. The state imposed higher taxes on waste shipments and fewer PCB-contaminated materials were sent as tonnage dropped. In the early 1990s an awareness of environmental racism arose among community activists and academics, said Bullard. He said Louisiana in particular became a "hotbed" of environmental racism lawsuits, with many communities along the Mississippi River serving as sites for incinerators and petrochemical plants. In the mid-1990s, the Japanese company, Shintech Inc., wanted to build a $700 million plastics plant in St. James Parish. But parish residents got help from student attorneys at Tulane Environmental Law Clinic. Shintech eventually scaled down the plan to $250 million, and moved it to Plaquemine. In rural Lowndes County, one of the poorest in the country, efforts to build a 230-acre solid waste landfill near the historic Selma-to-Montgomery National Historic Trail are on hold because of community outrage. County commissioners approved the project on land owned by Waste Management Inc. But Lowndes County Citizens United for Action sued to halt construction, contending in part it was wrong to put a waste disposal site near the highways where marchers helped inspire the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The case is making its way through the courts. The mainly black county residents had support from the mainly white residents of Lowndesboro. "Twelve jobs _ come on," said Barbara Evans, who heads the community group. "Twelve jobs for a dump on the … historic civil rights trial." Evans said with roughly 250 types of landfills in the state, including 29 that take in more than 32,000 tons of waste daily, Alabama doesn't need new landfills to handle its trash. "I think Alabama is being targeted and I think especially the communities of color and low-income neighborhoods are being targeted," she said.

 Ralph E. Wirtz of the Daily News If you are a little younger, you still would have seen some of the tanks and the smokestacks, but the wording on the side would have changed. You would have seen "Total" emblazoned across the white metal. Today, you can still see some of the tanks and some of the smokestacks, even though the plant closed two years ago. But they are going fast, as are the remnants of what used to be a thriving industry in this Gratiot County city. Including, the residents hope, the pollution. The pollution is what you wouldn't have seen had you been driving through Alma - the oil slowly seeping toward the groundwater through the earth, or the sludge that accumulated on the bottom of Horse Creek, a tributary of the Pine River used for outflow from the Total refinery waste ponds. Some people noticed, although few outside Chicago, Lansing or the immediate area. For the past eight years, investigations have revealed large amounts of pollution in the ground, water and air surrounding the plant site. The investigations have resulted in a $4 million fine and a $9 million cleanup project for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock - the latest owner of the property. The stories of the cleanups along the river between Alma and St. Louis are intertwined, much like the histories of the two cities. They both grew in fits and starts, counting logging and agriculture as the first wave of industry, heavy manufacturing in the early 1900s as the second and growth of two distinct industries as the third. The chemical industry in St. Louis began in 1935, when the Michigan Chemical Co. began taking brine from the ground near the area's mineral springs, turning it into bromides and salt. Crystal Flow salt was a hot item in area grocery stores. As Michigan Chemical grew, it began producing methyl, ethyl bromides, magnesia, DDT, antihistamines and analgesics, and the waste from these processes went right into the river. People then didn't know what they do now about controlling pollution and there were few laws and regulations to force them to comply. In the middle of the century, if a reactor overflowed, it was allowed to just spill onto the ground, according to Jack Bails, who was chief of the Environmental Law Enforcement Division of the Department of Natural Resources beginning in 1976. "If people had a liquid they wanted to get rid of, they would just take it to the back 40," he said. "It was common practice at a lot of chemical manufacturing facilities." Ron Orwig, who now lives in Mount Pleasant, worked 13 years for Michigan Chemical. He agrees, citing one incident from 1974 or 1975. "I remember a hydrochloric acid tank, I don't know how many thousands of gallons were in it, that was being pumped, and whoever was pumping it forgot to open up the valve, and they sucked the bottom out of the tank. All that acid went right into the river." Even when the companies were abiding by the rules, the weak environmental laws of that time allowed problems to brew. "In the late 1970s, it became pretty obvious that disposal practices at chemical manufacturers were a major problem," Bails said. Sean Horne, project manager for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp. is in charge of tearing down the last of the refineries which dominated the Alma landscape since Mid-West Refinery opened its doors in 1934. Shortly thereafter, three other refineries - Leonard, Wolverine and Northern - opened after the Durbin Gusher was discovered in the Mount Pleasant oilfields in 1935. Another - the McClanahan Refinery -opened in St. Louis but was bought by Leonard in 1938 and moved into Leonard's operation. Wolverine and Northern closed shortly thereafter. Alma's two remaining refineries kept employment steady until Mid-West was purchased by Leonard in 1966 and closed. In the early 1970s, Leonard was purchased by the French oil company Total and operated until 1999, when it closed. Sixty years of putting pollutants into area waterways overwhelmed the system, and now community members and officials are taking the steps to clean it. In St. Louis, the Environmental Protection Agency has named the river a Superfund site and is taking out sediments that read as high as 34,000 parts per million DDT, along with high levels of polybrominated biphenyls and hexabromobenzene. In addition, Scott Cornelius of the Environmental Response Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is seeking to correct a problem at the Michigan Chemical plant site that threatens the cleanup. In Alma, the EPA came to an agreement with UDS to put $9 million toward the cleanup of petroleum pollutants from Horse Creek and the Pine River. Jim Sygo, chief of the Waste Management Division of MDEQ, said more will be spent, if needed, to bring the waterway and other contaminated areas "to the satisfaction of the state and state guidelines." State officials thought they had the problem solved in St. Louis in 1982, when the state, the Environmental Protection Agency and Velsicol Chemical Co., which purchased Michigan Chemical Co. in the 1970s, signed an agreement to cap the 54-acre plant site and contain any pollutants there. In the agreement, no action was taken on the pollutants in the river, and officials today say they believed at the time that sediments would cover the pollution, keeping it out of the food chain. "At that time, that's what we thought," Bails said. Unfortunately, they were wrong.

 LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer Environmental groups criticized Israel on Tuesday for a plan to dump treated factory wastewater into the Mediterranean Sea. For decades, factories have been discharging untreated waste into the Kishon River, which empties into the Mediterranean at Haifa Bay north of Tel Aviv. But the Environment Ministry banned the practice beginning Tuesday. As part of a master plan to clean up the polluted river, a bypass pipe would be built to carry factory wastewater with certain types of salts directly to the sea. Environmental groups said the ministry had failed to research possible harm to plant and animal life in the sea. "There are organic wastes, poisons and metals in that water," said Sharon Shemesh-Rosenbaum, a spokeswoman for the Israeli branch of Greenpeace. "We don't trust the factories to let only salts flow through the pipe into the sea." The ministry said it is studying the environmental affect to determine the length of the bypass and a best location to minimize harm to the sea. Officials believe "releasing the effluent into the depths of the sea will not damage the quality of the sea water," a ministry statement said. About 700,000 cubic feet of untreated water were being dumped daily into the Kishon River. As of Tuesday, all wastewater must be treated before it is discharged. The push to clean up the Kishon began in 2000 when it was revealed that 40 out of 750 divers of an elite navy unit, who had carried out diving exercises in the river, contracted cancer. The Kishon River and Haifa Bay are lined with chemical factories, which have been dumping their waste into the waterway for decades. Greenpeace also criticized Israel for allowing the heavy pollution of the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv, which also flows into the Mediterranean Sea. ___ On the Net: Ministry of Environment: http://www.sviva.gov.il// Greenpeace Mediterranean: http://www.greenpeacemed.org.mt/

 By oht_editor | on March 27, 2019 The Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP) recently held a 5,000th Verification Celebration in Lansing, highlighting the success of the voluntary program that has helped Lapeer County farms prevent and minimize pollution risks. The milestone represents the work and investment of more than 2,000 producers and agricultural and conservation partners across the state. As a longtime supporter, Michigan Farm Bureau (MFB) and county Farm Bureau members played a significant role in the program’s development, implementation and growth over its first two decades. A turning point for the program — and when the goal was set to reach 5,000 verifications — came in 2011, when legislation supported by MFB and sponsored by now-Senator Kevin Daley, R-Arcadia Township and former Senator Joe Hune, was signed into law. The Lapeer Conservation District has been instrumental in the verification of many dozens of farms in recent years — and that’s good news to the entire county, whether you live on a neighboring farm or miles down the road because the result is a better and healthier environment for all residents. The County Press in our keepsake Progress 2019 edition (March 3) showcased the achievements of local MAEAP verifications. MAEAP is a voluntary environmental program that works individually with farmers to identify and prevent environmental risks on farms that could result in groundwater or surface water contamination. The program evaluates various aspects of farms based on four systems: Farmstead, cropping, livestock, and forest, wetlands and habitat. After mitigating risks on the farm associated with one of the systems, MDARD staff visit the farm to verify the implementation of practices and verify the farm as meeting the program standards. Sen. Daley attended the March 21 event and reflected on the program. “MAEAP helps farmers to be better environmental stewards of their land and is a great example of how the agricultural community, environmental groups, and the government can work together to better the industry,” Daley said. “The 5000th MAEAP verification is a great accomplishment and I am proud to see the success of this program.” A fifth-generation farmer, Lapeer County and Michigan are fortunate to have Daley working on behalf of the agriculture community. He was first elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2009 and represented the 82nd District until 2014, when term limits prevented him from seeking another term. As one of the few farmers in the House at the time, he was the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. In 2018, he was elected to represent the 31st state Senate District, which includes Lapeer, Tuscola and Bay counties. He now serves as chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and is well versed in how MAEAP works. His farm, Daley Acres, is MAEAP verified — as is the Howell Farm owned by Rep. Gary Howell, R-Deerfield Township. Howell and his son, John, operate the farm. Howell has been a member of the Farm Bureau for 34 years, receiving the 2005 Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award. Daley has served on the Lapeer County Farm Bureau Board of Directors, Lapeer County Ag. Preservation Board, and is the former president of the Tri-County Michigan Milk Producers Association. Lapeer County is unique to be served by lawmakers in both Chambers, the House and the Senate, with deep and personal agricultural roots to this community who want the countryside to be free of agricultural pollutants for generations to come. The Lapeer Conservation District, a proud partner of MAEAP with Lapeer County’s legislators, for more than 70 years has worked with local landowners, farmers, governmental agencies, and other organizations to deal with environmental problems. The district board meets at the District Office at 700 South Main St. in Lapeer, Suite 120-C. Meetings are held on the third Thursday of each month at 8 a.m. The public is encouraged to attend.

 MNA Staff Caption Close From the Lansing State Journal LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Scientists want to use an unconventional method to remove pollution at former General Motors properties near Lansing where an underground plume of chemicals is creeping toward drinking water wells. The Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust controls the former GM plants. It is proposing a remediation method called "biosparging," which removes pollution by injecting air into groundwater. The method encourages bacteria to consume 1,4-dioxane, an industrial chemical that GM used to clean oil off car parts. Should the trust gain state approval, the project would be among the first and likely the largest to use the method, the Lansing State Journal reported . It's unclear how much the project would cost, but engineers said it could take six to 12 years to fully clean the water. The pollution was discovered after the trust was established by the federal government to take over the GM sites following the company's bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. The dioxane plume is located under two former GM plants in Lansing Township and Lansing. Dave Favero, deputy cleanup manager for the Michigan properties, said dioxane is very soluble. If dioxane is in oil, as it was used at the GM plants, "it leaches out and starts to migrate with the groundwater," he said. Long-term exposure could lead to liver, kidney and reproductive problems and possibly cancer, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Lansing-area plume is within the Lansing Board of Water and Light's wellhead protection area for some of its drinking water wells. Up to 10 of the utility's wells are downstream from the polluted groundwater. The utility started monitoring for dioxane in 2015, and found a small amount within the limits of what the EPA considers safe. The utility hasn't monitored dioxane levels that exceed the EPA's safe limit yet. The trust will need to get approval from state environmental regulators. Scientists and engineers could begin installing biosparging wells this year if the plan is approved.

 By Brian Nearing Troy Petroleum giant Chevron could pay about $1.8 million to clean up a former industrial site in South Troy once used to make manufactured coal gas and later to store asphalt, according to a plan being considered by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Work at the 7-acre Water Street property, located just south of the Route 378 (Menands) bridge, should start next year and last about nine months, according to a DEC notice this week. Storage tanks on the site were removed in 2006 and the site is currently vacant. California-based Chevron USA Inc. would pay to remove about 725 cubic yards of soil contaminated with nearly a dozen industrial chemicals, tar and asphalt left behind when the site closed in 1999 after at least seven decades of industrial use, first for plants that manufactured coal coke and gas, and then for asphalt storage and distribution. The ground is now polluted with aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzopyrene, benzoanthracene, benzene, toluene, arsenic and xylene. Tests have found coal tar as far as 11 feet underground. Once the contaminated soil is removed, the cleanup plan calls for the site to be covered with soil "acceptable for commercial and industrial land use," according to DEC. The land has been filled in with "slag, cinders, brick, gravel and other materials" over the past, according to DEC. DEC will hold a public hearing on the proposal at 7 p.m. Feb. 20 at Troy City Hall, 433 River St., and is taking public comments on the plan Feb. 1 through March 2, through John Spellman, project manager, NYSDEC, Division of Environmental Remediation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233, or john.spellman@dec.ny.gov. A copy of the proposal is available for public inspection at the Troy Public Library, 100 Second St., Troy.

 By Marissa Luck Exxon Mobil, under pressure from shareholders, has agreed to report plastic pellet spills from its polymer production plants to prevent ocean pollution, according to a shareholder group that focuses on corporate responsibility. The shareholder group, As You Sow, filed a proposed shareholder resolution in January with several major petrochemical producers, including Exxon Mobil, Dow Chemical, Phillips 66 and Chevron, asking for annual reporting on spills and measures taken to prevent and clean up spills. Exxon appears to be the first company to succumb to the pressure. Under a deal struck with As You Sow, Exxon will begin providing details about whether any spills occurred, specifics about how it is monitoring for spills and how it is managing pellets. It will also describe how the company assesses the effectiveness of pellet loss prevention measures. The company apparently did not have any spills though in 2018, according to As You Sow. As a result of the agreement, As You Sow withdrew its shareholder proposal, according to SEC documents. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment beyond what was said in the SEC documents acknowledging the withdrawal of the shareholder proposal. RELATED: Reporter’s Notebook: Can chemistry fix the plastic waste problem? "We are pleased that Exxon Mobil has agreed to do public reporting on plastic pellet spills and management," said Conrad MacKerron, senior vice president at As You Sow in a statement. "It is important for all industry players to establish similar transparency so stakeholders can get a realistic view of the size and scope of this problem. We hope the other companies we are engaged with will follow its lead. 260 species affected Exxon's petrochemical division has several plants that produce plastic pellets, called nurdles, which are used to produce thousands of everyday plastic products. These tiny plastic pellets, which can be spilled during handling and transportation and swept into waterways, are estimated to be the second largest direct source of microplastic pollution to the ocean by weight. The tiny pellets, the size of fish eggs, make their way onto shorelines, beaches and break up into smaller pieces that animals can mistake as food. Plastic pollution affects 260 species, causing fatalities from ingestion, entanglement, suffocation and drowning, according to As You Sow. Exxon Mobil is the first major petrochemical producer to agree to report information on plastic pellet spills publicly to shareholders, said Jane Patton, coordinator based in New Orleans with the anti-plastic pollution advocacy movement Break Free From Plastic. "This is significant and huge," Patton said. "I'm glad they're willing to disclose this, but there is a lot more that Exxon needs to be doing to mitigate harm to local communities" that comes as a result of air and waste pollution from petrochemical plants." Many petrochemical companies are involved in a program called Operation Clean Sweep that aims to promote best practices for pellet management and containment to prevent pellet spills.But As You Sow has criticized the group because it doesn't require companies to publicly report spills or plastic management methods. TEAMING UP: LyondellBasell, Dow chiefs call on industry to fix plastic waste problem The other shareholder proposals filed with Chevron, Phillips 66 and Dow Chemical will likely be voted on during shareholder meetings this spring. Taking responsibility As You Sow last year was involved in successful efforts to push Starbucks to ditch plastic straws and pressure KraftHeinz, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and others to commit to increase the use of recycled packaging in their products. Chuck Venezia, senior vice president of petrochemicals at the analyst and research firm Argus Media, said petrochemical companies typically have redundant systems to prevent spills because it's in their best economic interest to avoid losing the product. The issue of plastic pellet spills has not been a major focus area yet for the industry, but he noted that the industry is starting to take more responsibility for reducing plastic waste through better waste management systems, community education and recycling initiatives. "There are so many benefits to plastics that are not getting reported – but just like everything else they need to be handled and treated properly," Venezia said. Ashish Chitalia, polyolefin analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the industry is responding broader backlash against single-use plastics with initiatives such as the nonprofit the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. "We expect to see broader participation in reporting the plastic pellet losses, as doing so may enable companies to improve their economics, standard handling procedure and their sustainability goals," Chitalia said.

 By Taylor Goldenstein AUSTIN — Attorney General Ken Paxton, on behalf of the state’s top regulatory agency, filed suit Friday against the company responsible for the Deer Park fire, alleging it released pollution in violation of the Texas Clean Air Act. In the 18-page suit filed in a Travis County district court, Paxton seeks a citation and civil penalties against Intercontinental Terminals Company, the liquid storage terminal company whose facility caused a series of fires this week, for violations of Texas Commission on Environmental Quality rules. The violations include unauthorized air pollution, outdoor burning and visible emissions. Paxton also seeks an injunction to force the company to comply with the law. “The state of Texas works hard to maintain good air quality and will hold ITC accountable for the damage it has done to our environment,” Paxton said in a statement. “ITC has a history of environmental violations, and this latest incident is especially disturbing and frightening. No company can be allowed to disrupt lives and put public health and safety at risk.” For subscribers: Latest fire contained at charred Deer Park plant The TCEQ continues to monitor the air quality in the affected areas about 20 miles east of Houston. The federal Chemical Safety Board, which investigates serious chemical accidents, announced Thursday that it is opening an investigation into the ITC fire. “I would like to thank the Attorney General for acting so quickly on TCEQ’s request to enforce against ICT, LLC,” the environmental agency’s Executive Director Toby Baker said in a statement. So far, Baker said, only air quality violations have been cited in the suit “due to the dynamic, ongoing investigation.” Additional violations, including water quality, will be referred to the Attorney General as part of the action, he said.

 By Erin Douglas Caption Close Companies found to have emitted the most air pollutants in 2017 in Texas, according to an environmental report, are in some cases pinning the blame on Hurricane Harvey, as well as unique one-time plant upsets and maintenance. A recent report based on data filed by companies to state regulators identified Texas' top air polluting companies. Environment Texas, an environmental policy nonprofit that analyzed the data and produces the yearly report, found that the Houston metro area, home to several refineries and petrochemical plants, had the second most unauthorized releases of pollutants in the state. RELATED: Texas for most unauthorized pollution, environmental study finds Companies can receive permits to regularly emit pollution while operating major industrial sites. When facilities exceed those permitted levels, companies are required to report the incidents to state regulators with information that includes how much they emitted and the duration of the incident. Using those filings of unauthorized emissions, Environment Texas found in its yearly analysis, that hundreds of companies reported over 4,000 unauthorized pollution incidents in 2017, up a little over 9 percent from the previous year. The group has conducted the annual assessment since 2015. Companies file emissions event reports each time a plant has an unauthorized release of pollutants due to a malfunction or planned activity, such as equipment maintenance. If the plant claims and proves that the excess emissions were not preventable, among other criteria, then no fine is imposed. Both Exxon Mobil and Magellan Midstream Partners mentioned the hurricane as a key contributor to the high emissions their plants produced in 2017. But Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said he does not believe this is a valid excuse for the pollutants. He pointed to several Corpus Christi plants, which shut down operations several days prior to the hurricane making landfall. "Certainly there were increases in emissions for some facilities during the hurricane, but we think many, if not most were preventable," Metzger said. "These (events) are preventable if companies take the time, spend the money and train their workers to control emissions." The hurricane may have contributed to 8.3 million pounds of air pollution released by industrial plants immediately before, during and after the storm, as a result of waiting too long to shut down, according to a separate report by the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit organization. Other companies said that the high levels of emissions during 2017 were due to scheduled, one-time work and other singular events. Metzger, however, said contrary to these being one-time events, data from prior years show that violations are ongoing and occur over and over again. PLASTICS: For LyondellBasell CEO, pollution is personal In 2017, 275 companies reported over 4,000 emissions events that resulted in the release of more than 63 million pounds of air pollution in the state, up 27 percent from 2016. As a comparison, the average American family emits 411 pounds of sulfur dioxide each year, according to the Leonardo Academy, a nonprofit that quantifies environmental impacts. The Environment Texas report questioned how effective the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's regulatory process is, showing that enforcement has decreased as a percent of emissions events since 2011. There were more than 4,000 reported unauthorized emissions events reported in the state in 2017, yet the TCEQ only imposed penalties on 58 emissions events that year, data showed. The TCEQ declined to comment on the report specifically, but Brian McGovern, TCEQ spokesperson, said the commission "vigorously" defends its enforcement process. Here are facilities with the greatest unauthorized emissions, according to the Environment Texas analysis: 1. Waha Header Compressor Station, Trans-Pecos Pipeline LLC 3.88 million total pounds "This was the result of an isolated event due to scheduled work that occurred on the pipeline back in 2017," wrote Lisa Dillinger, spokesperson for Energy Transfer, in a statement. "This is not something that will be re-occurring." 2. Mabee Ranch CO2 Plant, Chevron USA Inc. 3.26 million total pounds "In February 2017, we experienced an event at the Mabee C02 Plant, which accounted for over 80 percent of the facility's emissions referenced in the report," wrote Veronica Flores-Paniagua, spokesperson for Chevron, in a statement. "In 2018, we made significant investments in the McElroy field and Mabee C02 Plant to decrease emissions and improve reliability." 3. Seminole Gas Processing Plant, Hess Corporation, OXY USA Inc. 3.03 million total pounds "Occidental took over operatorship of the Seminole Plant in September 2017, and is actively investing in programs to control, monitor and minimize emissions from that plant as we do for all of our operated assets," wrote Susie Geiger, spokesperson for Occidental, in a statement. 4. Galena Park Terminal, Magellan Terminal Holding LP 2.53 million total pounds "Like many others in the energy industry with facilities along the Texas Gulf Coast, in 2017 our Galena Park facility experienced record breaking rainfall and flooding from Hurricane Harvey, which resulted in a petroleum products release and associated emissions event," wrote Bruce Heine, spokesperson for Magellan Midstream Partners in a statement. 5. Silvertio 76 17 Unit P 1H, Anadarko E&P Onshore LLC 2.16 million total pounds "The emissions cited in the report are related to a well-control event that occurred in 2017," wrote John Christiansen, spokesperson for Anadarko Petroleum. "We reported both the event and associated emissions to the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, respectively, with the Railroad Commission overseeing the cleanup that was completed in 2017." 6. ExxonMobil Beaumont Refinery, ExxonMobil Oil Corp. 1.74 million total pounds "The Environment Texas report compiles emissions data submitted to TCEQ for isolated events," wrote Sarah Nordin, spokesperson for ExxonMobil Oil Corp. "Compiling this data does not tell the whole story, especially in 2017 with the impacts of Hurricane Harvey." 7. James Lake Gas Plant, James Lake Midstream LLC 1.57 million total pounds James Lake Midstream could not be reached for comment. 8. JT McElroy 202 TB, Chevron USA Inc. 1.53 million total pounds "In 2018, we made significant investments in the McElroy field and Mabee C02 Plant to decrease emissions and improve reliability," wrote Veronica Flores-Paniagua, spokesperson for Chevron, in a statement. 9.

 Sudhin Thanawala, Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Wildfires in California in 2018 released the rough equivalent of about 68 million tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide — about the same amount of carbon emissions as are produced in a year to provide electricity to the state, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Friday. The carbon dioxide figure — based on data analyzed by the U.S. Geological Survey — is more than 15 percent of all emissions produced by California in a year, according to Zinke. "We know that wildfires can be deadly and cost billions of dollars, but this analysis from the U.S. Geological Survey also shows just how bad catastrophic fires are for the environment and for the public's health," Zinke said in a statement. This year included California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire — a blaze in November that took out nearly 14,000 homes in a rural Northern California county and killed at least 88 people. Another fire that started the same day in Southern California killed three people and destroyed 1,500 structures, including the homes of celebrities in tony Malibu. Those two fires produced emissions equivalent to roughly 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide, Zinke said. The 2018 emissions figure for California wildfires is "strikingly high, significant in the context of overall statewide emissions, and likely a record value for single-year direct carbon emissions from wildfires in California history," said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. "It is an alarming number, but we live in a fire-prone state," said Dick Cameron, director of science for land programs at the California chapter of the Nature Conservancy. Zinke used the carbon figure he released Friday to continue to push for the thinning of forests. Cameron said that would help but that climate and home construction were also significant factors in the destructiveness of the fires. Cameron cautioned that wildfire emissions were still a relatively small component of climate changing greenhouse gases. In California, cars and other transportation account for more than 40 percent of total emissions.

 By Brian Nearing Green Island A pollution cleanup for a planned $60 million project at the site of a former oil tank farm on a Hudson River island will continue until early 2020, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The 11.2-acre vacant property, just south of the Green Island Bridge on what is called Center Island, was once home to King Fuels, which closed in 2008 after nearly a century of use as an oil terminal. Peter Luizzi & Bros. Contracting of Albany wants to build a marina there as part of a mixed-used residential and commercial development called Starbuck Island. So far, the developer has pumped out underground oil from the site and removed some tainted soils, said Sean Ward, executive assistant to Green Island Mayor Ellen M. McNulty-Ryan. "The hole dug there must be about 30 feet deep," he said. Now, the site must be refilled and covered over with about two feet of clean soil to meet state pollution standards for "restricted residential use," according to a notice issued Wednesday by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The DEC notice said this work will begin this month and continue for about 15 months. Luizzi wants to construct 250 housing units, along with a marina, offices, restaurants and shops. The plan also calls for 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of commercial and retail space, 5,000 to 10,000 square feet of office space, 8,000 to 10,000 square feet of restaurants, and other amenities. Pollution tests of the site done in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2016 found levels of barium, lead, mercury and other chemicals in the ground and water. This year, DEC has overseen the removal of tons of tainted soil contaminated by fuel oil and other chemicals. Investigations in 2017 found a 3-foot-thick layer of liquid petroleum about 25 feet underground. State-ordered tests also found that the site was made up of as much as 28 feet of "historic fill materials including ash, brick, glass and other waste materials." Cleanup plans included: — Removal of underground storage tanks.— Collection and testing of groundwater.— Injection of chemical stabilizers to neutralize contaminated groundwater.— Filling in and covering over remediated areas with clean soil.— Installation of a "cover system" consisting of building foundations, retaining walls, rip-rap, asphalt roads and walkways.— Areas not paved over will be covered with 2 feet of clean soil in order to meet state safety standards for residential areas.— Installation of vapor intrusion mitigation systems in all on-site buildings.— Creation of a health and safety plan, and a community air monitoring plan as the cleanup continues.

 By Kenneth C. Crowe II Caption Close NASSAU – The town crowned Tributary T-11A as Little Thunder Brook to transform it from a quiet little stream that’s been polluted by the Dewey Loeffel Landfill Superfund Site to a war cry recalling the community’s 19th century history of fighting back. “Referring to the stream at T-11A doesn’t do it justice. We’re trying to stand up for rural New Yorkers who’ve been ignored,” said Supervisor David Fleming. The Town Board reached back 175 years to capture the fury of the Anti-Rent Wars that shook upstate New York in the 1840s. Frank Abbott fought under the name Little Thunder when he led his neighbors dressed as Indians to protest high rents. They even tarred and feathered their opponents as they fought for their cause. “Frank Abbott helped to bring down politicians that ignored the rights of rural residents. In this fight for our collective future, it is fitting that we honor Abbott’s legacy with the healing represented by the work about to start on Little Thunder Brook,” Fleming said. The town sees itself standing up to Albany and Washington, D.C. using Little Thunder to shout out for attention to neglected issues. The heavily polluted Dewey Loeffel Landfill became a toxic dump when an estimated 46,000 tons of industrial waste were buried at the site. The toxic materials included industrial solvents, waste oil, PCBs, scrap materials, sludge and solids. Soil and sediment along Little Thunder Creek is contaminated with PCBs -- polychlorinated biphenyls --a suspected carcinogen. Little Thunder Creek is a 1,900-foot-long tributary of the Valatie Kill, a protected trout stream that empties into Kinderhook Lake in Columbia County. Until the Town Board acted earlier this month, the creek was unnamed, known only by its forgettable bureaucratic designation of T-11A. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2 Office said in a statement it fully supports the renaming. "EPA encourages community members and their representatives to become involved in the issues that affect their communities. We welcome new ideas to target air, water, and other pollution. Community engagement and grassroots involvement is crucial to addressing environmental concerns such as the contamination in and around the Dewey Loeffel Superfund site," its statement said. The symbolism evoked by the name Little Thunder can be a rallying point for residents and a platform to launch additional action, said Jennifer Dodge, an assistant professor at the state University at Albany’s Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy. “What we can understand from this type of symbolic politics is what is at stake for people in an issue, in addition to the tactical and strategic issues… In the Nassau story, the strategy of naming the river Little Thunder might work well to get people mobilized because they might identify with the “little guy takes on the government” narrative..,” said Dodge, an expert on framing facts, symbolic politics and environmental policy conflicts. The question remains if the new name will be as successful “in the sense of raising the issues up, that is, about the contamination of the water and potentially the human health effects, which is a very powerful narrative in politics,” Dodge said. Dan Shapley, Water Quality Program director for Riverkeeper, said the health of the smallest tributaries impact the Hudson River. "Naming a stream is a simple and powerful act. Once we've ennobled a stream with a name, it's harder to neglect and pollute it. And I have to add, Little Thunder Brook is an awesome name," Shapley said in a statement. Cleanup work is under way at Little Thunder Creek. The General Electric Co. is removing contaminated soil and sediments along the creek. These will be replaced with clean backfill; the stream channel will be restored; and trees and shrubs will be planted. The EPA has said the work will be completed in early 2019.

(Pioneer file photo) Caption Close Within a few weeks, more anglers hope to be on their boats. (Pioneer file photo) Within a few weeks, more anglers hope to be on their boats. (Pioneer file photo) BIG RAPIDS — With the current, global COVID-19 situation, DNR advises fishermen to head out to fish only if you're feeling well and practice social distancing, at least 6 feet away from another person. Frequently wash your hands with soap and warm water, or use hand sanitizer. If driving to or from your fishing spot, roll the windows down a bit for air flow, the DNR said. Though anglers are still ice fishing in the northern regions of the state, the shoreline ice is breaking up and making it harder for anglers to get on and off the ice. Where the waters have opened up, docks are slowly being installed. In Mecosta County, “there’s a few guys still out fishing for perch at Davis Bridge,” Tanner Havens of Frank’s Sporting Goods in Morley said. “It’s slowed down the last couple of weeks. We’re just waiting for some rain down to Croton, they’re catching a lot of steelhead. That’s starting to heat up. With a little bit of rain in the next week or two, it’s getting ready to kick off. We’re needing some rain.” Tom Tanner, of Triggertime Outfitters, Big Rapids, said it’s still a transitional period from ice to regular fishing. “There’s some steelhead and trout fishing. But I have no clue how it’s going,” Tanner said. In northwest Michigan, at Lakes Cadillac and Mitchell, anglers still were ice fishing, although the ice is becoming more and more questionable, the DNR said. Areas with moving water have opened, and the shoreline is starting to open. “Steelhead is the order of the day, Rob Eckerson of Pappy’s Bait Shop in Wellston said. “The Big Manistee is the place to be. Water is around 39 degrees. At 40 is when it starts to picking up. River flow is medium, so that’s also good. Bear Creek has fish in it Betsie River has fish in it. The lakes have opened up. You can launch a boat at Portage Lake and you can launch a boat at Manistee Lake.” At Manistee, pier anglers were getting some steelhead. Once the waters clear up, fishing should be decent for steelhead and brown trout, the DNR said. “I haven’t heard of any walleye yet being caught off the pier,” Bud Fitzgerald, of Tangle Tackle Co. said. “River fishing seem to be pretty good all the way from the dam down. For the Manistee River steelhead are in the river; however, there have been no great reports coming in, the DNR said “It’s slow down a little bit,” Kristen Loeffler said. “It’s mainly because of the coronaviris. The people going out fishing they’re going to Manistee Lake and doing perch fishing. I here they’re doing pretty good. I heard some people are going to the river. I don’t know how they’re dig there. I had some guys heading down to Manistee Lake. Some guys are heading over to Portage.” Pier fishing should improve for steelhead and brown trout at Ludington, the DNR said. Fishing Tip: Storing ice-fishing equipment for next season Courtesy of the Michigan DNR You may want to think about getting ready to store your ice fishing equipment. The key is doing it properly, so you’ll be ready to hit the ice next winter. Here is a checklist of things to do: •If you have an auger, check for any damage and dry all the blades before storing it. You may want to consult your power auger’s manual to know how to appropriately handle any leftover gas and how to protect the engine. •Remove batteries from any electronics to prevent any potential damage from leaking batteries. •Make sure your portable shelter is completely clean and dry before storing. You may want to put some moth balls in it or hang it to keep pests at bay. •Take a full inventory of your rods, reels and tackle to see what you might need/want next year. Also remove all bait or line from your hooks and lures for storage and make sure everything is dry. By the time everything is properly stored, you’ll be itching to get out on your favorite stream, river or lake for some spring fishing.

 Coal is neither beautiful nor clean. It is now and always has been the most destructive fossil fuel to extract, and the dirtiest to burn. Even with new technology that tries to scrub out pollutants, coal is still filthy. Now, after more than two centuries of causing death, coal itself is dying. The United States still has more than 8,600 coal-fired power plants that produce at least one megawatt of power. They provide 27 percent of our total power output. But that number is shrinking — more than 200 coal plants have shuttered since 2010 — and will continue to do so. Some plants are being replaced by natural gas, some by renewables, and some aren't being replaced by anything. Coal will not be missed by most of us, and for good reason. In 2016, the last year for which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has, or is willing to share, data, coal burning produced a cornucopia of dangerous and unwanted toxins. For example, coal burning plants produced 576,185 tonsof carbon monoxide, 197,286 tonsof particulates of the sort that get into our lungs, 82,400 pounds of lead, 77,108 pounds of arsenic, 45,676 pounds of mercury (42 percent of all the mercury pollution), and 9,332 pounds of cadmium, not to mention more than a million tons of sulfur dioxide. All of it is either carcinogenic or known to cause pulmonary disease and respiratory distress. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 30,000 Americans die directly from particulate pollution every year. Even the Trump Administration's wholesale deregulation of coal plants, which reversed efforts to curb both end-product pollution and environmental damage during extraction, won't be enough to save coal. It earned votes in coal country, but the industry is gasping its last, a fitting end to something that caused so many to do the same. Though our lungs and our land will benefit from coal's demise, the cause has very little to do with a response to climate change, pressure from environmentalists, or even a faint concern for the environment or our health. It's way simpler than that. The economics of coal is no longer tenable. Natural gas is now much cheaper and, as a bonus, burns much cleaner than coal. Renewables like wind and solar are cheaper still — less than a fifth the cost of coal. The decline of coal has the added benefit of a cessation to the unimaginable environmental destruction caused by coal mining. Nearby streams and wetlands are destroyed, wastewater ponds leach into groundwater and frequently erupt beyond their man-made levees, coal dust destroys nearby woodlands and, of course, the mine workers themselves are exposed to life-threatening pollutants daily. What the EPA should have stopped long ago will now, finally, be stopped by economics. This is a death that will benefit the vast majority of us but not everybody. Some coal industry workers will be left behind, absent some help. Coal mining operations, which employed more than 863,000 less than a century ago, now use less than 50,000. But that's still a significant economic demographic, men and women who will be without jobs and untrained for anything else. A good example is the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-burning power plant outside of Page, Arizona, on the Navajo Nation. Operated by the Salt River Project (SRP), a quasi-governmental utility, the Navajo Generating Station is shutting down. Some of the plant's 500 employees will transfer to other SRP power plants, but most will simply be out of a job. And the 300 employed at the Peabody coal mine that provides the fuel will also be laid off. Not huge numbers in the overall picture but devastating on the Navajo Nation, where unemployment hovers around 45 percent, and 43 percent of the residents live below the poverty line. It's a scenario being played out around the country where mines are located in economically distressed regions. There is a solution for displaced miners, though one not likely to be undertaken. At least some of the environmental damage around coal mines can be mitigated. The piles of toxic waste can be removed to a safer landfill designed to hold such substances. Streams can be cleaned. Waste ponds can be drained. The landscape can be restored to some semblance of what nature created. It would require re-training but provide useful employment for many displaced miners for a very long time because there is much work to be done. And, yup, the federal government should pay for the work since the federal government allowed this environmental destruction to take place. There is apparently a bottomless pit of available money, deficits be damned, so we should spend some to fix the damage we've created. Coal's condition is terminal. No amount of deregulation will save it. Some residual coal dust will be all that's left.

 Four bills state legislators passed during its lame duck session have transformed Michigan’s environmental policy.One sweeping new law prevents the state from enacting environmental standards that are stricter than federal standards, except in certain cases. Another rolled back wetlands regulations. A third made it harder for state regulators to react to scientific developments when measuring hazardous contamination. A fourth bill enabled the construction of a tunnel for the Line 5 pipeline at the Straits of Mackinac, a move decried by opponents who have fought to have the 66-year-old pipeline removed. “WRITTEN BY SPECIAL INTERESTS”For environmentalists in northern Michigan, the passage of the laws marks a particularly dark time for the state.Christopher Grobbel, a former DEQ staffer and owner of Grobbel Environmental & Planning Associates, an environmental and land use planning firm in Leelanau, says he was appalled that the legislature would vote to reshape the state’s environmental policy and undo, during a lame-duck session “at the 12th hour, literally, on the way out of the door, ”decades of lawsthat were often crafted through bipartisan compromise and consensus.Michigan has a history of strong environmental regulation, Grobbel says. “This is really a major step backward.”Dave Dempsey, who served as an environmental advisor to former Gov. Jim Blanchard and is a senior advisor at Traverse City-based FLOW, a Great Lakes advocacy group, says the laws mark “the biggest steps back in environmental politics in Michigan in decades.”Environmental protection has historically been important to Michigan citizens, Dempsey says. There was a long track record of conservation and environmental stewardship that crossed party lines and led to pioneering measures to protect the state’s natural resources.That started to change in the 1990s, Dempsey says, as politics became more polarized, and the conservative movement shifted away from support of environmental policies. The 2018 laws mark the consequences of that shift that began in the 1990s.“The way it happened was undemocratic and sneaky,” Dempsey says. “It was an exercise in placating special interests; the bills were written by special interests, and they were products of right wing-think tanks and lobbyist.” A CHECK ON REGULATORSSen. Wayne Schmidt (R-Traverse City) voted for three of the laws; he didn’t vote for the “no stricter than federal” bill, he says, because he believes that one went too far. Nonetheless, he said it is an exaggeration to say that the laws constitute a reversal of course for environmental regulation in Michigan.“I think that Michigan continues to have strong considerations for the environment and conservation,” Schmidt says.He says the new laws serve as a check on regulators who, in some cases, have gone too far in enforcing environmental laws.Jason Hayes, director of environmental policy at Midland-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank, strongly disagrees that the laws meant Michigan was abandoning environmental regulation. He believes the laws are good for property rights and business while still enabling the state to regulate the environment.“They enforce transparency on the government, which is always a good thing, and they respect private property rights, and they allow businesses to do what they need to do, which is good for the economy,” Hayes says.In addition, he says, the laws still enable Michigan to enforce environmental rules; they just make it harder for regulators to overreach.“All three of those provide safety valves for the government,” he says. A BIG THREAT TO WATERFrom Dempsey’s perspective, the worst of the four laws passed during the lame-duck session was HB 4205, the bill that mandates Michigan environmental standards can be no stricter than federal standards.Michigan has historically been a leader in taking action on toxic chemicals, Dempsey says, and HB 4205 repudiates that tradition.“Michigan was the first state to cancel most uses of DDT, which put us ahead of the rest of the country,” he says. “We are, in essence, throwing away that legacy with this law. … We cannot know what the next toxic emergency is going to be, but when it comes, it’s going to be very difficult for Michigan to take appropriate action.”Liz Kirkwood, executive director of FLOW, says the “no stricter than federal” law is especially hard to stomach now, as the state faces threats from PFAs, a diverse group of contaminants that don’t degrade and can therefore migrate and pose a threat to drinking water over years or decades.The new laws, along with SB 1244, which will make it harder for regulators to enact stricter standards for contamination based on peer-reviewed science, are going to pose a challenge to regulators trying to keep drinking water safe from PFAs, said TJ Andrews, legal counsel at Watershed Center Grand Traverse Bay.Andrews says the “no stricter than federal” law is particularly alarming in light of what’s happening at the EPA under the Trump Administration, which has expressed contempt for environmental regulations.“It seems like it’s part of a broader conspiracy, right?” Andrews says. “Let’s slash it at the federal level, and then make sure the states can’t do any better.”Grobbel says he fears that, by barring Michigan from having any higher-than-federal environmental standards, the law could throw a significant portion of the state’s environmental regulation into limbo.In many instances, the DEQ has been allowed to enforce federal law because the state’s standards are stricter under a standard called “primacy,” Grobbel said.On wetlands, for example, the federal government has historically acknowledged the state’s higher standards by handing over enforcement of federal law to state officials.Now that Michigan no longer has “primacy” to take control over federal environmental standards, Grobbel says he doesn’t know who will be responsible for environmental regulation going forward.“It’s always been the case in Michigan, even under Republican governors, that we wanted to keep that closer to home rather than rely on the Chicago EPA,” says Grobbel. “Now, instead of relying on ourcriteria, we’re going to default to the federal criteria to determine which wetlands are regulated.” CONCERNS “A LITTLE OVER THE TOP”Hayes says those fears over the “no stricter than federal” bill are overblown.Gov. Snyder vetoed an earlier version of the bill several years ago; this time he signed it.Hayes says that’s because Snyder required that the law contain a less strict threshold for state regulators to prove a need for stronger standards. That means that in the event of an emergency, state regulators will be able to step in.“Initially when it was written, they had to provide a clear and convincing case for a more strict regulations,” he says. In the version that passed, they have to show a need through a preponderance of evidence.In the case of something like PFAs, Hayes says that, since those are not regulated by the federal government, the state standards would remain intact.He says he isn’t concerned that Michigan is aligning with federal standards, even as the EPA is reinventing itself in the age of Trump.“The notion that the state of Michigan is just chucking environmental regulations out the door and the baby’s going out with the bathwater, I think, is a little over the top,” Hayes says.He says he believes the EPA became too aggressive under Obama administration control, and the Trump administration is correcting that.“The EPA is focusing where they’re supposed to be,” he says.Along with Schmidt, Rep. Larry Inman (R-Traverse City) also voted against the “no stricter” bill.“We are surrounded by the Great Lakes, and we have a lot of inland lakes and inland rivers, so we’re kind of in a special state where we’re surrounded by fresh water,” he says. “There could be instances where we need stricter than federal regulations.”Inman said though he is a Republican, he weighs environmental bills carefully and is willing to listen to environmental groups.“They are not shy about calling the office,” Inman says. “I would say that they are really a great resource. In the era of term limits, they have a sense of history a lot of times.”Inman voted for the wetlands bill, which, although it is also decried by environmental groups, was drastically altered between when it was introduced and when it passed, making it much less severe.“Every bill that comes before us, when it first comes out, a lot of times it comes with a lot of controversy, so we get a lot of phone calls in our office from constituents,” Inman says. “The legislative process softens up the bill.” QUESTIONS OVER WETLANDSAndrews agrees that the final version of the wetlands bill, SB 1211, isn’t nearly as bad as an earlier version of the bill, which would have reclassified the minimum size for “regulated” wetlands from five acres to 10 acres, a move that might have put as many as a half million acres of wetlands out of regulation in the state.Heather Smith, the Watershed Center’s baykeeper, says the law will make it harder to investigate violations because of new burdens the law foists upon already stretched-out DEQ staff. For example, the law requires that if the DEQ wants to investigate an alleged wetland violation on private property, they have to get a search warrant.“It makes it harder to investigate violations,” she says.Grobbel says another significant change in the new law is that now, only wetlands contiguous with bodies of water are regulated; it used to be that wetlands within 1,000 feet of the Great Lakes or 500 feet of an inland lake or waterway were regulated.Up North, that’s going to affect a lot of property, and it’s going to make a lot of wetlands unregulated.“The big message out of this is they try to put a spike into the whole notion of regulating isolated wetlands,” Grobbel says. “We’re going to have a number of areas that are going to lose protection that are wetlands. Small, isolated wetlands, but ecologically and hydrologically important wetlands.”That doesn’t necessarily mean a lot of land that couldn’t be developed will suddenly be developable, however, Grobbel says. Even under the old laws, an application to fill wetlands was virtually never denied.Rather, DEQ regulators would work with the landowner or developer to determine how a project could move forward with the least harm done to the wetlands, and then issue the permit.What the new law means, Grobbel says, is that in a lot of cases, that kind of harm mitigation will no longer have to take place, and those wetlands will just get filled — ultimately at the expense of the region’s water quality.“If you’re a banker or a developer, you probably love it,” Grobbel says. COMPLAINTS OVER DEQ ENFORCEMENTInman says he liked the final version of the wetlands bill: “I thought it was a fair balance.” He says DEQ staff can sometimes be overzealous.Schmidt also supported the wetlands bill, even in its earlier, more severe form.“I was thankful they scaled it back, even though I voted for the first, much more drastic version,” he says.Schmidt says he heard complaints about the way the DEQ enforced environmental regulations, and he thinks this law will make it clearer what is and what is not allowed.“There seems to be or has been inconsistencies within the department,” Schmidt says. “We tried to get it so people know exactly what the rules are.”Hayes agreed that wetlands enforcement at the DEQ could be overzealous, and he said this law was needed.“There’s examples where we have helped defend property owners who have been unreasonably regulated in terms of wetlands use,” Hayes says.Hayes cited one example of a Grand Rapids business owner whom the DEQ refused permission to construct an employee parking lot because of a wetland that Hayes contends was, in fact, wet ground due to snow melt. He said that led to a legal case that went on for years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.Hayes said the bill by no means will mean the wholesale destruction of wetlands.“We’re maintaining standards, we’re still maintaining wetlands, but at the same time, we’re protecting landowners,” he says.Kirkwood hopes the bill doesn’t result in too much wetlands destruction. The value of wetlands to society is not always evident or obvious, but they serve many crucial functions.“We know that wetlands have incredible economic and ecological benefits for us,” Kirkwood says.Wetlands mitigate flooding during severe weather, they serve as wildlife incubators, and they abate pollution and protect water resources.“They can’t be perceived as swamp any more — they serve a vital role in urban and suburban and rural communities,” she says. Area environmentalists are also alarmed over SB 1197, which authorizes the construction of a tunnel for Line 5 at the Straits of Mackinac andcreated the Mackinac Straits Tunnel Authority.The promise of a tunnel doesn’t quell fears over the danger posed by the aging pipeline; it might be a decade before the tunnel is completed, and in the meantime, the oil line will remain in operation.“I think it would be difficult to say that a modern, well-built tunnel presents the same water quality threat as a 60-year-old pipeline,” Andrews says. “But I would say, from a water quality perspective, it’s the length of time leaving the pipeline there that’s the bigger threat.”Traverse City’s Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities is also opposed to the tunnel plan.In a statement opposing the tunnel, Jim Lively, Groundwork’s policy director, argues that letting the pipeline run for 10 more years as-is poses too big a threat; that Michigan doesn’t need the oil transported in the pipeline; and, in fact, most of it returns to Canada through Sarnia. He called the “process for crafting and passing the tunnel deal … rushed, secretive, and likely unconstitutional.”Gov. Whitmer asked Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office to research questions about the tunnel deal; Kirkwood said FLOW is assisting in that research.“We do not litigate. However, the attorney general has asked for legal advice and analysis,” she says. “Enbridge (the Canadian company that owns the pipeline) continues to be an unworthy and distrusted tenant, and so the state of Michigan has legal authority and a duty to ensure that it upholds its fiduciary public trustee duties to the citizens of Michigan.”Hayes says he believes pipelines are safer alternatives to other means of transporting oil and that Line 5 delivers fuel that’s needed in Michigan. Although Line 5 opponents argue that much of Line 5’s load passes through Michigan and goes back into Canada through Sarnia, Hayes says that a lot of that oil is refined there and then returns to Michigan as gasoline.Hayes says he shares the concern over the age of the pipeline and also worries that something could happen in the 10 years before a tunnel is completed.“What you do is, you do your darndest to make sure it doesn’t happen,” he says.Schmidt voted in favor of the tunnel. Inman voted against it, but he said only because of how long it’s going to take to build.“I can live with a tunnel. I can live with some advancement of utilities going through that tunnel,” he says. “The biggest concern that I had was the seven to 10 years” delay. A Bright Side for Environmentalists — One That Didn’t Pass.One bill that failed was one Traverse City environmentalists followed closely — it would have prevented localities from writing ordinances to protect trees, and was proposed just as Traverse City was debating whether to establish such an ordinance.The bill was supported by the Traverse City Area Chamber of Commerce, and Sen. Wayne Schmidt (R-Traverse City) was a sponsor of an amendment to the would-be law.“We were disappointed that the chamber was involved, and that Wayne Schmidt was the sponsor of one of the tagalong [bills],” says TJ Andrews, legal counsel for Watershed Center Grand Traverse Bay.The tree ordinance discussion arose following the massive tree-cutting at the Moorings development, on the west end of the city.“The planning commission was specifically inquiring of staff, saying, ‘Where’s our tree protection?’” Andrews says. “And staff were saying, ‘We just don’t have any,” and the planning commission said, ‘Well, we need one. Let’s make it a priority.’”As the Watershed Center worked to help Traverse City draft an ordinance, the law was proposed in the state legislature, which Andrews found underhanded.“There was a lot of discussion when the tree ordinance was first presented to the planning commission, and there was some argument that this was not the result of a public process, and you had too few stakeholders sitting at the table,” she says. “So, we sat down with the chamber. Their position was that more public input was needed to get a better ordinance.”But ultimately the chamber and Schmidt supported a state law that would have put an end to the discussion.Schmidt says he supported the law because he heard from constituents who were worried about how much the tree ordinance would cost.Schmidt says the law wasn’t introduced in reaction to Traverse City’s tree ordinance proposal; he says there were a couple downstate communities also debating tree ordinances. He says some of the tree ordinances under consideration were too severe and “were going to be extremely punitive, especially in an urban area where you want to concentrate development.”Nonetheless, Schmidt does not expect the bill to be re-introduced this sessionAndrews hopes Traverse City can pass something now that the bill failed.What she and the Watershed helped create was a framework for a tree policy that could be made as strict or as loose as city commissioners want, she says. Essentially, an ordinance would say that if you cut down a big old tree, something has to be replanted.“It should be done, and someone is going to have to brave and say that this is an issue that this community is going to address,” she says.

 When an anchor strike punctured an underwater pipe in the Straits of Mackinac on April 1, releasing an estimated 600 gallons of a petroleum-based fluid into the Great Lakes from an electrical transmission line, the response was hampered by extreme weather. Opponents of Enbridge Energy’s Line 5 oil pipeline fear the incident shows that responders aren’t ready for a catastrophe; meanwhile, Enbridge and U.S. Coast Guard officials say the reaction proved they are prepared to staunch an incident before it becomes dangerous. Whichever side is right could one day be critical to Michigan’s economy; a Michigan State University professor just released a study that concluded a Line 5 oil spill at the Straits of Mackinac could cost the state more than $6 billion. A STRAITS OF MACKINAC OIL SPILLA tugboat — the Clyde S. VanEnkevort — allegedly caused the April 1 failure of the American Transmission Company line. It had dragged an anchor that punctured underwater pipes carrying power cables, prompting a leak of the fluid used to insulate those cables into the Straits. The fluid has been variously described as anything from the seemingly harmless “mineral oil” to the more toxic-sounding “dielectric fluid.” Either way, everyone hopes that by now the substance has dissipated into the lake and vanished as a threat to human and animal health. The leak was discovered April 1 and reported to the Coast Guard the following day, a lag that concerns Line 5 opponents. In the days that followed, severe winter weather that persisted through early April made it difficult for responders to assess and address the spill. Perhaps more alarmingly, the same vessel’s anchor apparently struck and damaged one of the two Line 5 pipelines, too. Each of those lines carries as much as 11 million gallons of oil across the Straits per day. The anchor strikes occurred just weeks before Traverse City-based For Love of Water released the results of a study it had commissioned to estimate the impact a Line 5 failure would have on the state’s economy. Michigan State University ecological economist Dr. Robert Richardson conducted the study. FLOW’s executive director, Liz Kirkwood, said she was grateful to be talking about the hypothetical impact of a Line 5 failure rather than an actual catastrophe. “That an anchor potentially struck and hit Line 5 and didn’t cause a rupture, I think, is miraculous,” Kirkwood said. Kirkwood said that when FLOW commissioned Richardson’s report last year, they started out considering an anchor strike to be among the threats to Line 5’s integrity. At the time, that seemed odd to some observers, Kirkwood said, because conventional wisdom had it that a combination of corrosion and human error were the biggest threats to the pipeline. “I remember people’s reaction, which was, ‘Well, that’s odd. I mean, why aren’t they talking about corrosion?’” she said. That the ATC pipeline was struck and leaked into the Straits should serve as a warning shot, she said. “I think it drives home the reality of what a catastrophic spill could look like,” she said. “It’s the precursor of what would happen.” WHAT WE LEARNEDWhat the ATC spill taught us, Kirkwood said, is that responding to an environmental emergency in the Straits of Mackinac can offer unexpected challenges. It took a day for the ATC rupture to be reported and by then, due to weather and the passage of time, there was apparently little that could be done to clean up the spill. “I think we learned that, number one, the reporting time can be very significantly delayed,” Kirkwood said. “In this particular case, it took ATC almost 24 hours to report.” Another ominous lesson learned from ATC, Kirkwood said, is that in the event a Line 5 failure were to occur during extreme weather conditions, response to the spill could be crippled. After the ATC spill, days went by before a boat could be launched to survey the area, she said. “There were no boats that were able to go out to assess and contain this spill, and so you had 600 gallons that ended up just diluting into the Great Lakes, and that’s sort of the best that we can hope for,” Kirkwood said. Kirkwood said she heard ATC executives describe the early April weather following the spill as “extraordinary,” and she said she found that disturbing because extreme weather events around the Straits of Mackinac are not extraordinary ­— they are commonplace throughout the year. For example, the Mackinac Bridge is routinely closed to traffic during periods of high winds. Kirkwood recalls hearing an anecdote from a Line 5 researcher who said that while he was working in the field, his team split up on each side of the bridge. “He said, ‘We couldn’t even cross the bridge to communicate with the other part of our team,’” Kirkwood said. “High wind conditions could prevent responders from crossing the bridge.” The FLOW/MSU study did not take into account how severe weather and ice cover could hamper the response. Kirkwood said the cost of a Line 5 failure amid harsh winter conditions could be far worse than what the study imagined. “Everything that you think is going to be easy could be the opposite and could be very, very difficult,” Kirkwood said. “Presumably, the price tag would go up, because the longer that you have oil in the open waters without it being contained, the more likely it is to actually come to shore. When you look at the cost of an oil spill, once you hit land, the cost goes up very significantly.” RESPONSE FROM ENBRIDGEThe FLOW/MSU study estimates that a Line 5 failure might release 2.5 million gallons of oil into Lake Michigan and Lake Huron in a better-than-worse-case-scenario. The cost of cleanup and the economic effects of the loss of tourism, damage to drinking water infrastructure and fisheries, and reduction in property values could cost Michigan billions. “If a rupture were to occur, it is possible that automatic response valves would be triggered, and a release of oil could be of a lesser magnitude,” Robertson wrote in the report. “However, it is also possible that a failure of those valves and an extended delay in response, such as those experienced in pipeline ruptures, could lead to a release of oil of a far greater magnitude than this scenario, with economic damages well in excess of the estimates in this report.” Ryan Duffy, a Lansing-based Enbridge spokesman, said the FLOW study is “fundamentally flawed.” “It is based on an unrealistic volume of product potentially released. Enbridge has done extensive safety and risk planning on Line 5,” Duffy said in an email. “Our analysis indicates a potential worst-case discharge at the Straits of Mackinac is approximately 5,000 barrels, which is less than one-tenth the volume assumed in this study.” Moreover, automatic shut-off valves would stop the flow of oil once there is a drop in pressure in the line caused by a leak, he said. There are automatic shut-off valves located on both sides of the pipelines that are capable of shutting off the line within minutes. “We would immediately activate containment and clean-up equipment and crews,” Duffy said. Duffy said Enbridge is working with the state of Michigan to find ways to mitigate the risks posed by anchor strikes, including using a tunnel underneath the Straits to move the line away from where it can be hit by anchors. The tunnel plan, worked out between Enbridge and Gov. Rick Snyder, is considered a betrayal by many Line 5 opponents, who want the pipes removed from the Straits entirely. Asked what he thinks the response to the ATC spill demonstrated about how prepared Enbridge and the state and federal responders would be in the event of a Line 5 failure, Duffy wrote: “Our focus, 24/7, is on spill prevention. In the unlikely event of an incident we have the training, the people and resources to respond quickly to a release in the Straits of Mackinac. We have equipment positioned near the Straits to enable access, containment, and removal of oil. We have also practiced our winter spill response plans in real-life winter conditions in the Straits of Mackinac. That experience will help us in the event of a spill.” A message left at ATC inquiring about the apparent day-long lag between when the April 1 spill occurred and when it was reported to authorities was not returned. In a press release, the Coast Guard described the Unified Command’s ATC response as a success: “‘Since the beginning of this response, the Unified Command, together with the many federal, state, local and tribal partners, worked diligently to mitigate any pollution threat to our Straits and precious wildlife, and to be transparent in our efforts,’ said Cmdr. Shaun Edwards, Incident Commander. ‘Although our mission is complete, we all remain committed to learning the cause this incident and doing our best to eliminate any threat of something like this happening again.’” INJURED BIRD REPORTSWildlife photographer Lynn Fraze first learned about Line 5 when she attended a meeting about it at Petoskey High School in 2011, long before “Shut Down Line 5 Pipeline” yard signs proliferated across northern Michigan. Fraze said she was alarmed when she approached the building and found it secured by police officers. They were apparently there in case there was trouble from people wanting to protest the Enbridge Kalamazoo oil spill, a 2010 event that saw nearly a million gallons of oil flow into the regional river system and cost more than a billion dollars to clean up. “There was a couple that stood up at the end of the meeting, and they tried to talk about the Kalamazoo spill and they said, ‘If you don’t do something about this pipeline, you’re all going to be really sorry,’” Fraze recalled. “And the police officers came in and escorted them out.” Today, Fraze said she is disturbed by her perception that authorities are downplaying and minimizing the severity of the ATC spill. Fraze is a member of Mackinac Straits Raptor watch, which happened to be holding an annual festival in Mackinaw City on the weekend following that spill. The spill also unfolded in front of a beach where an MSRW bird watcher had been stationed to count birds since late March. The bird watcher, Adam Bradley, wrote on his blog that he learned of the spill when officials began to visit the beach and started asking him pointed questions. Fraze, who was the photography coordinator for the festival, believes that Bradley saw evidence of wildlife harmed in the spill. “Adam was saying that there had been 50 red-breasted mergansers there a couple days before that had been out on the ice and came in as a group and did excessive preening for over an hour, just in one area, trying to clean their chest area,” Fraze said. “He said in his 20-some years of observing wildlife, he’s never seen that. And so he reported that to the authorities.” A couple days after the festival, Fraze found what she considered evidence of the oil spill — a clear ice that was stained yellow, a sight she’d never seen before over decades of visiting the Mackinac Straits. “It looked to me like Vaseline, a little lighter tint than Vaseline, but it was completely clear,” she said. “I called and tried to report it to the Coast Guard. It took me over an hour. They transferred me around, ‘This is the command number you should call’; ‘No, this is the command number you should call’; ‘Oh no, you should call this number in Washington, D.C.’” She said she was finally connected to someone who took her report. Yet, in a May 8 press release, the Coast Guard said: “During the response, the Coast Guard and other agencies continually surveyed the Straits from the water, the air, and from the shoreline. There have been no reports of pollution or injured wildlife.” Petty officer Brian McCrum of the Coast Guard public affairs office in Cleveland insisted that no one reported injured wildlife to the agency. It’s possible that Bradley’s report of birds preening excessively and Fraze’s report of discolored ice were deemed inconclusive observations and therefore were not counted as reports of wildlife injury or pollution. Fraze said she remains concerns about what the spill’s long-term impact on wildlife will entail. LOWER CONSEQUENCES FOR BIRD KILLSIt just so happens that whether or not wildlife was destroyed as a result of the ATF spill is a moot point, at least as far as federal penalties are concerned. Days after the spill, the Trump administration fulfilled a pledge to gut the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, a law that was enacted in concert with other countries amid concern over several bird species that had gone extinct over a century ago. On April 11, the Interior Department issued an order that the law would no longer be used to punish the killing of birds when birds are killed as a result of any activities that are not undertaken for the purpose of killing birds. For example, unless a company caused an oil spill with the intent to kill birds, they can no longer face penalties under the MBTA for birds that are killed in an oil spill. It was a reversal of years of consensus over what is considered to be one of the county’s first environmental laws. According to the The Washington Post: “The new interpretation reverses decades of action by Republican and Democratic administrations to protect the animals as they navigate the globe.” Fraze hopes that this change in policy will not turn out to be relevant for the Straits of Mackinac bird populations. She hopes that Line 5 is decommissioned and shut down before any wildlife is threatened. “It’s common sense that they have a backup plan (to transport the oil elsewhere). Would a billion-dollar company not have a backup plan to keep the flow of oil moving?” Fraze said. “I don’t want to, as a wildlife photographer, take pictures of animals, birds primarily, covered in oil. I don’t.” Even if we did learn from the ATC spill that there are trained and competent responders ready to react at the Straits of Mackinac to a Line 5 failure, Kirkwood said, that shouldn’t be acceptable. “I think all of us are wondering, why are we trying to prepare for Enbridge’s disaster, and why is the public being burdened with this risk that is absolutely avoidable?” she said. “We will never be as prepared as we want to be, given the age, given the track record, given the extraordinary risk.” First Name: Last Name: Email Address: City: State: Also sign up to receive The Ticker: Also sign up to receive the Leelanau Ticker:

 You likely believe the primary purpose of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to, you know, protect the environment. These days you would be wrong. Since it was first created in 1970 during the Nixon Administration, the EPA has been a wonkish outfit full of scientists doing science stuff. It is, by its very nature, often at odds with major industries because it regulates much of what they can and cannot do. It should be the enemy of polluters, and it was for 46 years, regardless of who lived in the White House or controlled Congress. That has all changed since Donald Trump became president and appointed Scott Pruitt as the EPA administrator. Pruitt, the former Oklahoma Attorney General, has apparently decided the EPA's primary role is to unburden the industries it is supposed to regulate from the yoke of pesky rules. His anti-EPA crusade started when he was still in Oklahoma and sued the agency 14 times for what he considered overreaches. He won one of those cases — on a procedural issue. Now, as EPA administrator, he doesn't need the courts; he can arbitrarily change regulations as he pleases. (Not laws, but rules and regulations promulgated by those laws. Let's see ... he reduced restrictions on methane gas emissions from new oil and gas wells. Methane is an especially onerous greenhouse gas contributing to climate change but Pruitt doesn't really believe in human-caused climate change, so that's an irrelevant fact to him. He reduced restrictions on the construction of new coal-fired power plants and their toxic emissions. He told coal industry leaders “the war on coal is over.” Since coal is by far the worst air-polluting fossil fuel, that's not such good news. He tried to reduce or eliminate restrictions on the use of chemical fertilizers in the agriculture industry. We know those fertilizers leach into groundwater and run off into our streams, rivers, and lakes. The algae blooms that occasionally show up in lakes are thought to be caused by these fertilizers, and they don't do our groundwater any good, either. The courts have, at least temporarily, blocked his decision. He lifted a ban on the use of chlorpyrifos, an insecticide the EPA's own scientists believe may cause neurodevelopmental problems in children. He has placed the rules that restrict the emission of mercury and arsenic, both known poisons and carcinogens, “under review,” the step he usually takes before eliminating regulations. He was and is an ardent foe of the Paris Climate Accords or any other climate rules since, as stated before, he's not sure humans or greenhouse gas emitters are responsible. He has proposed something he calls the “speed cleanup” of Superfund pollution sites. Not to worry, though. He has appointed a former banker to head up that effort, a man banned from banking for life because he made illegal loans. That top-notch group hasn't yet done anything. Pruitt has also banned any scientists who have accepted government grants in their work from serving on any of the EPA's many advisory panels. That pretty much narrows the field to those working for the industries the EPA is supposed to be regulating, somewhat skewing results. Pruitt's solution? He disbanded most of the advisory panels, realizing the last thing he needed was a bunch of scientific facts. Altogether, Pruitt has either relaxed, eliminated, or currently has under review a whopping 67 environmental rules and regulations. He has not yet explained how any of it was done in service to the environment. He has met with the leaders of the chemical, oil, gas, coal, and agriculture communities but has avoided environmental groups altogether. None of this has much helped morale at the EPA, where 700 employees have now left, fully a quarter of them scientists. We all understand the urge of every new administration to try and attack a bloated federal bureaucracy. We know there is waste and duplication aplenty in most agencies and departments, and we'd welcome somebody actually doing something other than just talking about it. But systematically dismantling the rules that protect our environment from polluters for the benefit of those industries doing the polluting is not at all what we had in mind. Nor is ignoring the science on which those decisions should be based. Prior to the creation of the EPA, we relied on “the markets” and industry itself to protect our land, air, and water. Under the markets’ watch, 70 percent of our streams, rivers, and lakes were unsafe to drink, swim in, or eat fish from. Our air was a toxic mix of lung-disease-causing particulates and toxic gasses. We've come a long way since 1970, and most of us would not like to return to those days. Scott Pruitt, now in charge of protecting our environment, is one of the exceptions. His EPA has become Every Polluter's Ally. Just not ours. First Name: Last Name: Email Address: City: State: Also sign up to receive The Ticker: Also sign up to receive the Leelanau Ticker:

(Courtesy Photo) MANISTEE — Manistee City Council could move forward next week in its Wet Weather Corrective Action Program (CAP). In the past 30 years, Manistee has invested nearly $40 million to eliminate raw sewage discharges to the Manistee River. The city closed 18 combined sewer overflows, however, it still faces infiltration and inflow problems. Spicer Group, engineer of record for the City of Manistee, plans to eliminate illegal water in the city’s sewage system. "These bids are part of a two-phase project to meet state mandated requirements to manage inflow and infiltration and eliminate the city's last remaining Sanitary Sewer Overflow (SSO 018). Phase I will reduce inflow and infiltration by structurally lining approximately 5.4 miles of sanitary sewer (Phase I, Contract A), and providing storm water outlets and a storm sewer system to reduce inflow and infiltration (Phase I, Contract B)," said project manager John Bradley, of Spicer Group, in a memo. The city has publicly bid Phase I, Contract A for the Wastewater Collection System Rehabilitation. Five bids were received, with Inland Waters Pollution Control, Inc. submitting the low bid of $2,316,994; the highest bid was submitted by Granite Inliner for $3,526,575. The engineer's estimate is $2,340,000. The Department of Public Works (DPW) and city engineers recommend awarding the contract to the low bidder, Inland Waters Pollution Control, Inc. DPW director Jeff Mikula said in a memo to city manager Thad Taylor, Inland Waters "successfully completed the Pilot Sewer Lining Project in 2018." City council will meet at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in council chambers at City Hall, located at 70 Maple St. in Manistee. Council members also are expected to consider the Phase I, Contract B, Storm and Sanitary Sewer Improvements. Three bids were received, with Gerber Construction submitting the low bid of $1,770,267. The highest bid was submitted by Team Elmer's for $1,999,500. The engineer's estimate is $1,400,000 but did not cover several project items, such as water main replacement. DPW and city engineers recommend awarding the contract to the low bidder, Gerber Construction. Funding for both contracts is derived from the United States Rural Development Phase I Loan previously approved by City Council at $4.4 million. The loan is for 40 years at 2.375 percent interest. "Phase 2 improvements have been submitted to USDA Rural Development for funding review with construction anticipated to start in the spring/summer of 2020 depending on the timing of USDA Rural Development approvals," Bradley said in a memo. "The Phase 2 improvements will improve the conveyance of wastewater to the Wastewater Treatment Plant (Phase 2, Contract A) and will improve wet and dry weather screening, pumping and grit removal at a new headworks structure, provide 6 million gallons of storage for excess inflow and infiltration to be captured and treated by the WWTP to meet State of Michigan requirements, and provide screening, settling, and disinfection of flows exceeding the 6 million galIons of storage capacity (Phase 2, Contract 8)." Other items on Tuesdays agenda are as follows: • Consideration of ordinance 19-24 adding Chapter 1064 — charges for fire runs and emergency services. The department of public safety has requested a new cost recovery ordinance to authorize recovery of certain costs for fire runs and emergency services. An ordinance requires two separate readings. This ordinance was introduced on Dec. 17; it could be adopted during this meeting; • Consideration of scheduling a public hearing for a new Downtown Development Authority development plan for Feb. 4. The current DDA Development Plan and TIF sunsets on March 1. The DDA approved a new Development Plan for consideration, but a public hearing is required before adoption. • Consideration of ordinance 20-1 amending Chapters 866 and 867. "The City of Manistee Medical Marihuana Facilities Ordinance and Recreational Marijuana Ordinance authorize up to 12 grower facilities (medical marihuana) and 12 grower establishments (recreational marihuana). The amendment would make unlimited the number of available grower facility permits under Chapter 866 and grower establishment licenses under Chapter 867; it also would prohibit recreational marijuana establishments not specifically authorized under Chapter 867, including a designated consumption facility. If the ordinance is introduced on Tuesday, it could be adopted at the next regular meeting. • Consideration of zoning ordinance amendment Z19-25: Assembly Operation in Key Street Segment. City Council’s next work session is slated for 7 p.m. on Jan. 14 in council chambers. A discussion will be conducted on Substance Education & Awareness Sea Youth Presentation and the Strategic Plan.

 MNA Staff From the Associated Press DETROIT (AP) — Michigan's U.S. senators are seeking more federal funding to continue a wide-ranging Great Lakes cleanup program. Democrats Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters announced bipartisan legislation to renew and expand the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative at a series of news conferences Thursday and Friday. The bill would continue the program through 2026 and gradually increase its annual appropriation from the current $300 million to $475 million. The program focuses on some of the Great Lakes' most longstanding environmental problems, including industrial toxic pollution, invasive species, runoff that causes algae blooms and wildlife habitat loss. In Michigan, it has provided a combined $762 million for 880 projects, including restoring native fish populations in the Detroit River and removing 200 tons (181 metric tons) of marine debris from Belle Isle in Detroit.

 Tribune News Services The following editorial was published in the Los Angeles Times: (TNS) Will California show the nation how to take on the enormous problem of single-use plastic? Or will state lawmakers chicken out under heavy lobbying by plastic makers who are happy to continue to cover the world in discarded water bottles, used food wrappers and countless other pieces of disposable packaging? We will find out soon. It’s not an overstatement to say that the fate of one of the world’s biggest sources of pollution hangs on the passage of the California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act, by Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) and Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica). This legislation — which will be passed or die on Friday, the last day for the Legislature to pass new bills this year — would fundamentally reshape the product packaging industry by requiring products sold in the state to be wrapped in material that is being recycled or composted at a 75% rate by 2030. This is important because even though most plastic is theoretically recyclable, very little of it actually gets recycled. Only about 6% of the some 83 billion metric tons of plastic ever produced has been recycled. The rest can be found somewhere in our environment, possibly as tiny particles in the ocean or the food you’re eating. And that gap is likely to grow. Even while plastic production has increased, the global demand for used plastic bottles and bags to turn into something else has all but dried up. If the bill becomes law, manufacturers over the next decade will have to build recycling plants for their plastic detergent containers and potato chip bags (creating manufacturing jobs! President Trump’s gonna love this law), or repackage them in a material that is compostable or already recycled at a high rate, such as glass. And if California — which has the fifth-largest economy on the planet — demands sustainable packaging, the world’s manufacturers will listen. What’s remarkable is how many organizations that stand to be affected have dropped their initial opposition, including the California Retailers Association, the American Beverage Association and the American Chemistry Council. The state’s grocers have gone one step further and now support the bill, which is really astonishing considering that grocery stores would see many of the products on their shelves reconfigured under this bill. Those businesses deserve a lot of credit for not standing in the way of a law that, while good for the planet, would force a big change to their operations. Now it’s time for legislators and the governor to show their support. They have an important choice to make: They can show the world how to tackle the scourge of plastic trash. Or they can demonstrate how fear of political fallout is the biggest obstacle to our environmental challenges. No pressure.

url: https://thedailynews.cc/articles/home-key-tips-to-successfully-garden-in-the-montcalm-county-area/
 Wednesday, March 25, 2020 Since 1854 — News from Montcalm County and Ionia County, Michigan By The Daily News Staff | on October 30, 2017 “I think this is what hooks one to gardening: it is the closest one can come to being present at creation” — Phyllis Theroux, American journalist (1939-present) Landscape gardens this year in Montcalm County have been subjected to an usually wide range of severe environmental conditions — heat, rain and drought, just to name a few. To be successful, area gardeners have had to adjust to these conditions to keep their gardens productive. I have compiled this list of key tips to help our novice gardeners continue to have successful gardening experiences in future years. • Keep your Landscape Area Sanitized Keep your garden and surroundings clean and free of trash and assorted debris that always seems to accumulate during the growing season. This will improve the landscape appearance and just as importantly, eliminate places where pests and diseases can survive over the winter. • Maintain Healthy Soil Testing the landscape garden soil takes the guesswork out of maintaining the landscape garden in optimum condition for plant growth. Very simply, various plants have different nutrient and acidity (PH) requirements. To better understand what is needed, a soil test will inform you which nutrients need to be added by fertilizer to the soil to optimize the growth of the various plants in your gardens. By not adding unnecessary chemicals to your garden, you will reduce the amount of pollution in the air you breathe. MSU Extension provides an easy to use soil test self-mailers, which can be purchased at www.msusoiltest.com. The neat thing about this soil test is MSU Extension will give you recommendations for your landscape gardens if you supply them with specifics on the kind of garden you are having tested. The results will determine your soil texture, pH and provide you with nutrient levels in your soil. Also recommendations for lime and nitrogen you may need to add to your soil (if necessary). • Watering Correctly Novice gardeners usually water too much or too little with disappointment as a result. To do a good job with your garden, you need to spend enough time to find out what each of your plant groupings requirements is. As a general rule — although there are some exceptions — a total of an inch of water per week between rain and irrigation should be sufficient for your landscape garden needs. This includes trees and shrubs as well as grass plantings. Watering should be done in several sessions over the course of a week and will result in more robust plant root systems which in turn will lead to healthier plants. Watering lightly, even more frequently, will lead to shallower roots with the resulting plants more prone to drought and disease problems. Soaker systems are more effective than oscillating lawn sprinklers for watering plants. Using a ground drip soaker will minimize water loss through evaporation and reduce the risk of water soaked leaves which will eventually lead to plant disease. • Pick the Right Plants to Grow Picking the right plants to grow in your landscape gardens is not an easy task. It is easy to be overwhelmed with all the choices you have. An excellent choice for the novice gardener is sticking with native plants. Plants that naturally grow in our area and are selected to match the light and soil conditions on your property, will be the most desirable choices. These plants will require less water and have less need for fertilizers and pesticides to remain healthy. Presently, there are many choices in native plants with varying heights and shapes that are well adapted to our area conditions. For example, MSU has an excellent website reviewing all types of native plants that can be grown in our area, as well as other areas in the rest of Michigan at www.nativeplants.msu.edu. Natives I have had success with in Montcalm include: coral bells, purple coneflower, columbine, bee balm, black-eyed susan, switchgrass and juneberry trees. • Don’t Forget to Mulch Mulching is a real necessity for your garden. It acts as an insulator for the soil, keeping it cooler in summer and warmer in winter. Mulch significantly reduces weed growth, retains moisture and minimizes soil erosion. It especially helps in Michigan spring weather by preventing frost damage. Mulched plants will stay put in alternating freezing and thawing weather and will not appear early in brief spring warming periods. In general, mulch is usually used year round for trees, shrubs and perennials while annuals and vegetables are covered with mulch in the spring. There are many choices for mulch organic materials. Wood chips, shredded bark and straw tend to be the most popular. • Have a Bug Free Garden Mentality Most novice gardeners are upset when they see any signs of bugs in their landscape gardens and will usually try to destroy them by any means possible. In actuality, a garden in healthy balance will always have good bugs and bad bugs present. In fact, most of the good bugs in your garden beds keep the bad bugs at bay. They also help pollinate, which is a necessity for most plants and vegetables. Very few caterpillars, beetles, spiders or worms, for example, are really bad so don’t try to destroy them all. If in doubt use extension sites to research the bugs you encounter to determine whether they are beneficial to your garden. • Keeping Good Records As a final, but perhaps the most important tip is to review your past years gardening experience, both good and bad. To do this, I recommend keeping a garden journal — an inexpensive school notebook will work fine — so you have it as a handy reference. Problems you experience during the year, which plants you grew and where you placed them in your landscape gardens, what you liked and what you didn’t, are all things to consider for your journal. Also important is to list any changes you would like to make for the new growing season. Gardening is a wonderful hobby that almost everyone can enjoy at many different levels. By following the key tips described above, you will be able to manage most of the common issues you will confront. You must be logged in to post a comment. Our Hometown

RECREATIONAL USE 50 YEARS AGO During the third phase of Tom Dale’s demonstration called “The Tragedy of the Commons” students who represented the use of Higgins Lake 50 years ago put their sponges in the fish bowl and took out water. Dale said 50 years ago Higgins Lake saw an influx of people using the lake for recreational purposes.After the boat wash demonstration, the students were given a presentation by the Roscommon County Sheriff’s Marine Patrol Division. The presentation included tips for boating safety, life jacket use, safe swimming and boating regulations. RECREATIONAL USE 50 YEARS AGO During the third phase of Tom Dale’s demonstration called “The Tragedy of the Commons” students who represented the use of Higgins Lake 50 years ago put their sponges in the fish bowl and took out water. Dale said 50 years ago Higgins Lake saw an influx of people using the lake for recreational purposes. DEMONSTRATION A RESCUE SCENARIO Gerrish Township Police Department Sgt. Greg Patchin showed the students how a person with a spinal or neck injury would be retrieved during a water rescue. He said the front of the pontoon fills with water so rescuers do not have to hoist a victim in the boat. The person can be easily slid into the pontoon.The students were then divided into groups to take part in six rotational exhibits. HLF members Don Correll and Rick Meeks provided the students with a hands-on compass and navigation course. Michigan State University Extension Natural Resources Educator Julie Crick gave a shoreline erosion talk. She told the students about the causes of shoreline erosion and how to prevent erosion through greenbelt landscaping. During the morning rotations, the students were also shown how water travels through rivers with a Huron Pines water model. DEMONSTRATION A RESCUE SCENARIO Gerrish Township Police Department Sgt. Greg Patchin showed the students how a person with a spinal or neck injury would be retrieved during a water rescue. He said the front of the pontoon fills with water so rescuers do not have to hoist a victim in the boat. The person can be easily slid into the pontoon. THE END RESULT At the end of Tom Dale’s demonstration on “The Tragedy of the Commons,” the bowl which was meant to represent Higgins Lake stood dirty and with less water than when the demonstration began.The students were then provided lunch before the groups broke into the afternoon rotational schedule. During the afternoon rotational session, Gerrish Township Police Department Sgt. Greg Patchin gave a demonstration on how the department’s emergency rescue boat is used. He noted that the department has had the boat for a few years, but has not had to use it in an emergency situation. THE END RESULT At the end of Tom Dale’s demonstration on “The Tragedy of the Commons,” the bowl which was meant to represent Higgins Lake stood dirty and with less water than when the demonstration began. Patchin said the boat, which is a pontoon style vessel, is manned by three emergency workers. Two rescuers sit in the front of the boat, while a third drives in the back. When rescuing a victim who has a spinal or neck injury Patchin told the students it’s important to get the victim out of the water without causing more injuries. To help ease the victim into the boat, Patchin said the front of the pontoon fills with water so the victim can be slid into the boat and does not have to be hoisted or lifted out of the water. Once the victim in is in the boat, Patchin said the water is then released from the pontoon and they can make their way to shore to assist the victim. Gahagan Nature Preserve Educational Director Tom Dale’s focus was on the state of Higgins Lake now and in the past. Dale gave the students a presentation based on ecologist Garrett Hardin’s article “The Tragedy of the Commons.” In his presentation, Dale used a fish bowl to represent Higgins Lake. He then had each student draw a card that told them if they were a member of one of four time frames. The first group was phase one or 200 years ago when native Chippewa families used Higgins Lake. Phase two or 100 years ago represented the peak of the logging industry on Higgins Lake. Phase three or 50 years ago represented recreation at Higgins Lake and phase four or now represented the use of today. Each student used a sponge to take water out of the fish tank representing the use of the lake for each corresponding time period. During the native Chippewa families’ usage, Dale said they used the lake as much as they wanted without much disturbance to the waters. In phase two or the logging era, he said loggers would dam up areas and then use dynamite to release the water. As part of phase three or recreation 50 years ago, Dale said people began moving from the southern cities to the northern areas to get away from polio. He noted that during that time, people started to use the lake more for recreation and the lake began to be used more. During phase four or today’s use, Dale said the lake can be crowded and overused during the busy summer weekends. Dale told the students that Higgins Lake is a common use lake, meaning that anyone can use the lake as much as they want without restriction. He noted that there is no limit on use and the lake can become exploited. “Everybody owns the lake, it is common property,” Dale said. To help maintain the lake, Dale said the public must follow rules to protect the quality of the lake. He noted one of the most important rules people can follow is using the boat wash. He said boat washes help keep invasive plants and animals out of Higgins Lake that may be brought in from other lakes. He said that although conscious people with good intention use the boat washes, their efforts are negated by those who choose not to utilize the washes. At the end of the presentation when all four groups dipped their hands in the fish tank and took water out, the once clean water was dirty and the water level was lower. Dale said the end result is meant to represent the usage of Higgins Lake over the past 200 years. While Dale’s presentation was on usage, Darcia Little and Carla Elenz of the Camp Grayling Environmental Office taught the students about water pollution. As part of their presentation, they told the students that Earth has 320,000,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water and 75% of the Earth is covered with water. Other statistics included that humans are made of 65% water and humans use between 80 and 100 gallons of water a day. In order to help preserve Earth’s water, the two reviewed pollutants that should avoid being put in water. The list of pollutants include salts, fertilizer and pesticides, septic system waste, oils and greases, invasive species and trash. At the end of the day, the students were presented with certificates signifying the successful completion of Lake Saver Day. HLF Chair Vicki Springstead said that overall the day was a success and noted that Lake Saver Day was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Roscommon. She noted that funds provided by the Rotary Club helped pay for the lunch, supplies and compasses used in the navigation course. “The day went really well,” Springstead said. “I think they (the students) always get a lot out of it.” She said the goal is to provide the fourth graders with activities that are designed to spark their interest in science and ecology as well as teach them about recreation lake safety, lake preservation and stewardship. “We want to bring the wonders of nature into real life,” Springstead said.

 By Staff | on August 14, 2014 Having faced some criticism because the first installation of dune grass washed out, Friends of Trestle Park (FOTP) member Mary Michela addressed the Denton Township Board Aug. 6 about the need for dune grass at the park. Using a prepared written statement for her presentation, she said the grass acts as a filter for water run-off at Houghton Lake. She said the second planting is now in and, hopefully, the roots will establish themselves. Her written statement said in part: “The Friends of Trestle Park have been asked many times why we are trying so hard to establish dune grass at Trestle Park – wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper just to pave the whole waterfront and be done with it?? “First…our waterfront has taken a real beating from the very high water the past few years – this has taken a toll on the seawall at Trestle Park, and unless we can stabilize the ground behind the seawall, there is a real possibility that the seawall would need to be replaced, at significant cost to the township.” Supervisor Craig Cotterman noted that cracks in the seawall at the park have been patched. “The dune grass (American Marram Grass) that we have chosen has an extensive root system, which forms a mat of dense roots to hold the waterfront in place,” Michela’s statement continued. “This is the same type of grass found along the shores of the Great Lakes. It naturally forms an underground structure that holds the shoreline together and prevents erosion. We also took care when choosing a suitable grass that it spreads mostly through its roots, not from seed, so it will not become another invasive species. “Still, why not pave and be done with it? Well, the Friends of Trestle Park have agreed that one of our Mission Statement goals is that we are to ‘focus on ecological awareness and education.’ We are doing that with the rain garden, which filters polluted rainwater from First Street before it reaches the lake. “We also want to showcase a greenbelt or buffer zone between the turf-grass lawns of the park and the waterfront. The waterfront walkway, which is paved, creates a break from the lawns, and the greenbelt which holds the dune grass is one way to show the public that there are alternatives to having a fertilized and mowed lawn running right to the water’s edge. The dune grass not only stabilizes the sandy waterfront, it also filters runoff from the lawns and the cement walkway before it runs into the lake. If we simply paved the waterfront, all the runoff would end up in the lake. “Every time we can prevent unfiltered rainwater runoff from heading straight into the lake, that’s a good thing…even the small amount of fertilizer used on the Trestle Park lawns would add nutrients to the lake, which might sound OK, but it’s not – it adds to the pollution of our beautiful lake and adds to the problems facing our lake. “We want to be a part of the solution, not part of the problem, so we are working hard to establish the dune grass and let it do its important work.” Michela thanked the township board for being “forward thinking” and allowing the FOTP to try again to establish what members feel is a “best practices” method of handling erosion and runoff and to create an educational opportunity for the township’s waterfront community. She said some of the dune grass was set aside and that several FOTP members are “babysitting” it at their homes in case this application also has trouble getting established. “Volunteers make this community shine,” Cotterman said, following Michela’s presentation.

 By Staff | on March 13, 2014 In my opinion, many readers are confused by the two organizations repeatedly in the news with regard to the condition of Houghton Lake and Eurasian watermilfoil. The Houghton Lake Lake Association (HLLA) has existed for decades. It is comprised of resort owners, businessmen and people concerned with the health of Houghton Lake. The HLLA has hundreds of members who work on common causes. The Houghton Lake Improvement Board was established as mandated by state law, to further address the problems and to be able to buy chemicals. (Editor’s note: According to the HLIB, “Recognizing the need to effectively manage Houghton Lake, the Houghton Lake Improvement Board was established in 2000 under provisions of Michigan’s Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act.”) The HLIB only has seven members on their board. In my opinion, this current board condones chemical treatment above other recognized solutions, because it’s faster, not lasting, not necessarily cheaper. Milfoil can be managed with thoughtful consideration, but it’s not going away. Methods to treat combine chemical, harvesting, insect (weevil) barriers or mechanical raking. The chemicals introduced to our lake for milfoil pose serious risks. All these chemicals have warnings on their own labels as to being toxic. Fluridone has warnings of human, animal and environmental hazards, “if absorbed through the skin, swallowed or inhaled, call a poison center.” Remember this chemical kills plant life, a living organism. When the HLIB dumped chemicals in the lake without regards to a “green” approach, the HLLA became very vocal in the approach of the health of the lake. The green approaches could offset costs with environmentally safer composting, and barrier solutions or weevils as recommended. Sarah Little, Ph. D. (Wellesley Pesticide Awareness Coordinator) and Sherry Ayres (Toxic Action Center) authored the “Aquatic Herbicide Alert,” which states “Although EPA allows registration and restricted use of pesticides, they do not encourage their use. Registration of a product does not imply that it is safe; there are currently 36 EPA registered pesticides which are carcinogenic. In fact, the EPA states all ‘pesticide use creates some risk of harm to humans, animals, or the environment.’” Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of pounds of these chemicals have been introduced to our lake and we fish and swim there. The Roscommon County Democratic Party applauds the HLLA for keeping a watchful eye on the chemical pollution of our lake and demanding a greener approach to the ongoing fight against milfoil. This is not just a frontlotters problem, this is a problem for every resident in the watershed.

 By Staff | on July 04, 2013 For more than 12 years, the Central Michigan District Health Department has conducted a bathing beach monitoring program of public beaches in the six-county district which includes Roscommon, Arenac, Clare, Gladwin, Isabella and Osceola counties. However, funding for monitoring of E. coli is no longer being provided for local beaches. “Due to reductions in funding, for the past several years the number of public beaches that were sampled for E. coli bacteria by the health department has been reduced to include only those that have the highest number of bathers and/or have had a history of high bacteria levels from past water sampling efforts,” Michelle Patton, director of Environmental Health Services with the Central Michigan District Health Department said. “As a result, campgrounds, children’s camps and many beaches open to the public have been asked by the health department to either implement a water sampling program that meets the state standards and post notices at the sites to inform the public as to whether or not the water has been tested for E. coli bacteria.” She said if residents do not see a posting at the public beach advising whether it is monitored and how to find the results of testing, they should contact the beach manager or local municipality responsible for the beach to request it post the beach. “Unfortunately, beginning in 2013, we no longer have the funding to test any public beaches in our district that are inland waters. Our funding is limited to the beaches along the Lake Huron/Saginaw Bay in Arenac County,” Patton said. “We have notified all the municipalities and beach managers in our six counties where these inland lakes and rivers are located to notify them of the requirement to post their beaches – if they are not tested for E.coli bacteria according to the Michigan Water Quality Standards for public beaches. We have also offered to work with these beach managers to assist them if they choose to undertake a sampling program.” Roscommon Township Clerk Barb Stevenson said the beach at Houghton Lake Heights has a sign posted that it is not tested. However, a three-year grant obtained by the Muskegon River Watershed Assembly through the Department of Environmental Quality is providing monitoring at 11 locations, including the beach, but only after rain events. The “Houghton Lake E. coli Reduction” project is focused on reducing E. coli in Houghton Lake and to determine specific areas where it may be coming from. In all, 52 sites at Houghton Lake are being monitored. Surface waters contaminated with high concentrations of E. coli bacteria can result in “stomach flu” type symptoms including nausea, vomiting, stomachache, diarrhea, headache and fever. Other minor illnesses associated with swimming in contaminated waters include ear, eye, nose and throat infections and skin rashes. In highly polluted waters, swimmers run the risk of exposure to more serious diseases like dysentery, hepatitis, cholera and typhoid fever. “By monitoring our public swimming areas throughout the summer season, we can ensure public safety by warning of high levels of harmful bacteria,” Patton said. When it comes to making a personal decision as to which beaches to spend your summer days on, keep in mind the following tips: • Large amounts of waterfowl present (geese, ducks) could mean an increased amount of “bird droppings” which may contain high concentrations of E. coli bacteria or could lead to swimmers itch. • Do not swim in public beaches if you have open sores or lesions on your body. • Research the number of closings the beach has had in the most recent years. • If there has been a heavy rain event within the past 48 hours, use caution in swimming due to possible runoff and higher levels of bacteria in the water. • If the water is discolored with a greenish, blue or milky look this may indicate an algae bloom. Certain algae blooms can produce toxins that could make someone ill. • Public beaches that are used by a large number of people, especially small children, could contain body fluids and fecal matter. • Talk to the local residents who often times have a good perspective on the history of the beach. • Don’t swim where the beach has an overabundance of trash and litter. • Dry off immediately with a clean towel after getting out of the water. It is also a good idea to take a shower after spending a day at the beach. These two tips may help reduce your chance of getting swimmer’s itch.

 Jan 21, 2020 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin lawmakers are poised to pass a bill that would impose new restrictions on the use of firefighting foam containing chemicals known as PFAS to reduce soil and water contamination. Both the Senate and Assembly are scheduled to vote on the Republican-authored proposal Tuesday. The GOP controls both houses, making passage all but certain. The bill would go next to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who can sign it into law or veto it. Evers’ spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff didn’t respond to an email asking whether he supports the bill. Democrats have argued the measure doesn’t go far enough in reducing pollution caused by PFAS and they planned to push for even more limitations. Evers has made improving water quality a priority, though; he signed an executive order in August directing the Department of Natural Resources to develop regulatory limits on PFAS. The DNR’s board is set to vote Wednesday on whether to authorize the department to begin drafting those standards. PFAS are man-made chemicals that research suggests can decrease female fertility, increase the risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women and lower birth weights. The chemicals have been used for decades in a range of products, including firefighting foam, non-stick cookware, fast food wrappers and stain-resistant sprays. The chemicals have drawn more scrutiny in recent years as potentially toxic contaminants in ground and surface water. Tyco Fire Products discovered in 2013 that soil and well contamination on its Marinette fire training property contained PFAS and four years later acknowledged that the chemicals had spread beyond the facility. The company began distributing bottled water to residents whose wells may have been contaminated. Traces of PFAS also have been found in a number of wells in Madison. State health officials recently warned people to limit consumption of fish from Madison’s Lake Monona due to PFAS contamination. The state Department of Natural Resources hasn’t identified the source, but firefighters have trained with foam for years at the Dane County Regional Airport. Under the bill, the use of firefighting foam containing intentionally added PFAS would generally be prohibited except in emergency fire situations. Firefighters would have to train with foam or other substances that don’t contain the chemicals. Foam containing PFAS could be used in testing as long as the testing facility has implemented DNR-approved containment and disposal measures to prevent releases into the environment. Violators would face forfeitures of up to $5,000 per incident. MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Gov. Tony Evers said Monday that he will order the closure of all nonessential businesses ... MADISON, Wis.

 Jan 11, 2020 MILWAUKEE (AP) –Thirty-year-old Conner Andrews has swum in Lake Michigan since his childhood days vacationing in Door County. “It was always a huge deal for me to go to the beach and have fun there and enjoy the waves,” said Andrews, a Nashotah resident and former collegiate swimmer. These days he gets the same feeling swimming at Milwaukee-area beaches. But he must pick his waters and timing wisely –î to avoid wading into a contaminated stew of pollutants that might swirl in some locations. That includes bacteria-laden stormwater and sewage flowing into local waterways. Parts of the Milwaukee area rely on a combined sewer system to collect stormwater and sewage for treatment. But increasingly heavy rains can overwhelm the sewers, sending untreated waste into local rivers and Lake Michigan. The overflows hinder locals who like to fish and swim. And they can contribute to beach closures and make people sick. The wastewater flows intensified in 2018, even as the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District spends millions of dollars on a plan to eliminate overflows by 2035, state data show. In 2018, the agency overseeing Milwaukee’s system, which serves 1.1 million people and 28 communities, saw six combined sewer overflows — the most events since 1999. Those overflows sent 1.2 billion gallons of stormwater and untreated sewage into rivers, canals and a stream that drain into Lake Michigan. Milwaukee’s latest discharges come after the sewerage district spent $2.3 billion on pollution abatement in the 1980s and ’90s, including construction of what is now a 28.5-mile tunnel system to cut overflows into Lake Michigan. The city is not alone in grappling with overflows. Wisconsin in 2018 saw its most overflow events since 2010, with increasing volumes of discharged waste, Department of Natural Resources data show. Experts say the problem plagues communities across the Great Lakes, a drinking water source for 48 million people in the United States and Canada. Driving the spike: intensifying rainfall due to climate change. Investment at all levels of government has fallen short in addressing aging sewer systems overwhelmed by the increasing flows. “We’re seeing more extreme storms across the Great Lakes region, and you’ve got a recipe for some serious problems,” said Joel Brammeier, president and CEO of the nonprofit Alliance for the Great Lakes. Andrews has sought to draw attention to Milwaukee’s water quality pollution challenges by organizing the Cream City Classic, in which contestants swim a 1.5-mile portion of the Milwaukee River that mixes with Lake Michigan. Organizers held the first race in August 2018, specifically choosing that time when heavy rainfall was thought to be less likely. Rains have not thwarted the race in its first two years, but Andrews said he would not be surprised if that happens one day. Less than three weeks after the 2018 race, for instance, intense rainfall sent nearly 395 million gallons of stormwater and sewage into the Milwaukee River and other local waters. As Wisconsin’s largest city, Milwaukee’s sewage system leads in wastewater releases. In 2018, it discharged more than eight times more waste than systems in the rest of the state combined, due to wet weather, according to DNR data. Milwaukee’s latest sewage surge into Lake Michigan follows decades of major progress on the issue. About 8 to 9 billion gallons once overflowed from Milwaukee’s combined sewer system each year. That was before the sewerage district started building its Deep Tunnel in the 1980s, a 521-million gallon storage system 300 feet underground that collects sewage and stormwater until it can be treated and discharged. The tunnel, built in three phases, dramatically cut overflows after 1994, the first full year its initial 19.4-mile phase went into service. It helps the district treat more than 98% of its wastewater in a typical year, keeping at least 128 billion gallons of polluted water out of Lake Michigan. But increasingly heavy rains are now adding more stress to the city’s sewer system. The Milwaukee sewerage district’s two wastewater plants collectively treat up to 600 million gallons of stormwater and sewage each day. But just one inch of rain across the district’s 411 square-mile service area equals more than 7 billion gallons of water. “It’s when you get two inches of rain in 20 minutes that it overwhelms the sewer system,” said Bill Graffin, the district’s spokesman. Steve Vavrus, senior scientist with the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Nelson Institute Center for Climatic Research, said climate change is driving Wisconsin’s record rainfall. Last year was the wettest in the state’s recorded state history, while 2018 was third-wettest, according to data from the Midwestern Regional Climate Center. Excluding Milwaukee, Wisconsin communities in 2018 discharged 150 million gallons of sewage and stormwater. That was the highest volume since 2010, the fifth-wettest year on record. As of October 2019, 359 million gallons overflowed from those communities’ systems, while Milwaukee discharged more than 500 million gallons into waterways. That happened even as the Milwaukee district captured and cleaned a record 85.6 billion gallons of water. Climate scientists expect the region’s rains will only intensify as worldwide carbon dioxide emissions speed earth’s warming. That could send more pathogens into the water, said Sandra McLellan, a professor with the School of Freshwater Sciences at UW-Milwaukee. “Instead of that happening once a year, it’s going to happen two or three times a year,” she said. In one extreme 1993 case, the waterborne-parasite cryptosporidium sickened an estimated 403,000 people in a five-county area around Milwaukee, according to the American Journal of Public Health. Later research linked 54 deaths to the outbreak, mostly AIDS patients. The outbreak followed heavy rainfall, and experts speculated that human sewage and waste from slaughtered livestock and other animals contributed to the outbreak. Milwaukee has invested $508 million in treatment upgrades and monitoring to prevent a future outbreak. But other communities remain vulnerable to pollution caused by heavy rains and runoff. In a 2018 study, McLellan and other researchers found that gastrointestinal pathogens are “widespread in urban waterways following rainfall and 10-fold higher following (combined sewer overflows).” Researchers are increasingly flagging high levels of E. coli at beaches in Milwaukee and elsewhere along Wisconsin’s Great Lakes shorelines. The bacteria arrive in human, bird and animal feces, triggering beach closures and advisories that have spanned more than 60% of summer days at Milwaukee’s South Shore Beach. That beach and Maslowski Beach in Ashland are among those most prone to closure from unsafe swimming conditions, according to a July 2019 report from the advocacy group Environment America. The contamination worries Melodie Phipps of Ashland. She loved to walk barefoot along the sandy shoreline of Maslowski Beach and swim in Lake Superior’s Chequamegon Bay. But that was before she learned that Ashland is among cities struggling with sewer overflows. Now, she steers clear of the water. “I feel a huge grief –î huge sadness and a longing on a hot day when the humidity is 95% and you’re just sweating and it’s sunny,” she said. Researchers at Northland College in Ashland regularly sample water quality along the city’s beaches. More than 30% of samples collected between 2014 and 2016 exceeded federal water quality standards for E. coli. The bacteria stemmed from a variety of sources, researchers noted. In many cases, seagulls appear to be the most dominant contributor, said Matt Hudson, associate director with the Mary Griggs Burke Center for Freshwater Innovation at Northland. McLellan said similar studies have shown high levels of E. coli at Milwaukee beaches come mostly from shoreline runoff and wildlife –î not sewer overflows. But the discharges are a prime source for the pathogens most likely to cause illness, she added. “If I had to say what’s the most serious pollution sources, it’s sewage and any kind of human contamination.” In 2012, Wisconsin’s roughly 600 publicly owned wastewater systems reported needing a collective $6.3 billion in extra investment to meet federal water quality goals –î nearly half for pipeline construction or repair and managing stormwater. That includes Ashland. More than one-third of its sewer pipes are more than 50 years old, and nearly half are past their useful life, said John Butler, the city’s public works director. Ashland’s wastewater treatment plant can handle up to 2,700 gallons per minute. But heavy rain events can increase flows 12-fold, overwhelming the plant. More than 6 inches of rain hit Ashland during Father’s Day weekend 2018, sending 15 million gallons of wastewater into Lake Superior. Ashland’s overflows happen when water seeps into cracked pipes or into connections between the stormwater and sanitary sewer systems, Butler said. Since 1991, the DNR has awarded more than $4.6 billion in loans and assistance for roughly 1,000 sewage and stormwater projects, with about 30% of funding going to Milwaukee, according to the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Jim Ritchie, DNR environmental loan section chief, said funding requests are only increasing. About 96% of U.S. spending on water and wastewater projects comes from state and local governments, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The federal government chipped in billions for water and wastewater programs in the 2019 fiscal year, but its investment has declined in recent years amid competing priorities in Washington. Local governments are forging ahead with their own limited resources. Beginning next year, Ashland plans to spend about $600,000 annually for deferred upkeep while also seeking state loans, Butler said. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant also helped the city install a grassy channel at Maslowski Beach designed to capture and treat stormwater. Along Lake Michigan, the Milwaukee sewerage district is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into flood control along watersheds. It set a goal of zero overflows by 2035 by adding 740 million gallons of stormwater storage. The district estimates it will cost at least $1.3 billion to install green roofs, rain gardens and other projects to capture water across its service area. “We really live by the mantra that every drop counts,” said Kevin Shafer, the district’s executive director.

 Jan 9, 2020 WISCONSIN STATE REP. Todd Novak, center, gathers members of a bipartisan water pollution task force in the state Capitol in Madison, Wis., Wednesday to announce recommendations for curbing contamination from manure and fertilizer. (AP Photo/Todd Richmond) MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A bipartisan water pollution task force proposed more than a dozen bills Wednesday designed to curb contamination across Wisconsin, capping a year’s worth of research and discussion. Groundwater pollution has been a growing problem in Wisconsin over the last 20 years, creating a rift between environmentalists and the farmers they blame for contaminating wells and water bodies by spreading manure and fertilizers. The agricultural industry has become more concerned since Democratic Gov. Tony Evers took office last year that his cabinet agencies could impose costly new regulations. The package released Wednesday calls for the state to spend $10 million on a range of initiatives including: creating a new water policy office; bumping up state funding for county conservation workers; increasing grants for rebuilding or replacing wells contaminated with manure and fertilizer; and grants for farmers who grow crops that require less fertilizer. “It’s clear we can’t just throw money at these issues, thinking they’ll immediately go away,” Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who created the task force, said in a statement. “Wisconsin needs a long-term strategy to protect, preserve and promote clean water. These bills are a first step toward that goal.” The bills must pass the Assembly and Senate and be signed by Evers before becoming law. The Senate has proven to be a roadblock for many proposals that have come from previous Assembly task forces. Alec Zimmerman, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, had no immediate comment on chances for the water proposals. Time is running out for action this year. The Legislature is expected to be in session only a handful of days this spring, adjourning perhaps as early as February. Evers’ spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, said in a statement that the governor was glad to see lawmakers following his lead on water pollution. Evers declared 2019 the “Year of Clean Drinking Water” when he came into office last year. He released his own report earlier Wednesday touting his administration’s efforts to improve water quality. Evers’ report noted that the state Department of Resources has started drawing up restrictions on manure and fertilizer in areas prone to groundwater pollution and is developing standards for PFAS, chemicals found in firefighting foam. The report added that the DNR also is working on educating people about the health hazards of lead pipes and developing a program to forgive loans for replacing such pipes. “Tens of thousands of people in Wisconsin are afraid to turn on their tap to drink water,” Evers is quoted as saying in the report. “That is unacceptable, and we must fix it.” Vos created the task force a year ago at the request of Republican Reps. Travis Tranel and Todd Novak, who represent portions of Grant, Iowa and Lafayette counties in southwestern Wisconsin. Scientists have been testing wells in that region for contamination. So far they’ve found at least 60 wells polluted with fecal matter from humans and livestock. The task force, made up of 12 Republican and four Democratic legislators, held 14 public hearings on water quality around the state over the past year. The panel’s proposals include: creating a new Office of Water Policy within the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey; increasing state funding for county land and water conservation workers; and increasing grants for rebuilding or replacing wells contaminated with nitrates, which originate from manure and fertilizer. Other provisions include creating new grants for farmers who grow crops that require less fertilizer and extending a grant program for private septic system repairs for another two years.

 Dec 10, 2019 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An updated environmental review released by a state agency Monday found no serious threat to Lake Superior if crude oil ever leaked from a new pipeline to replace Enbridge Energy’s aging Line 3 across northern Minnesota. State regulators ordered the update after the Minnesota Court of Appeals in June declared that an earlier review, issued in February 2018, was inadequate because it failed to specifically address the potential impacts of a spill into the Lake Superior watershed. Line 3 carries Canadian crude from Alberta and clips a corner of North Dakota on its way across Minnesota to Enbridge’s terminal in Superior, Wisconsin. The replacement would double the capacity of the existing line, which was built in the 1960s and is increasingly subject to cracking and corrosion. Environmental and tribal groups have been fighting the project because of the potential for spills in the Mississippi River headwaters region — an important wild rice growing area — and other pristine waters, and because the oil would contribute to climate change. The update issued by the state Department of Commerce modeled the potential impacts of a spill where the replacement pipeline would cross Little Otter Creek. The department said a spill there would be more likely to enter the St. Louis River, with the potential for flowing downstream into Lake Superior, than other sites it could have modeled. A public comment period on the update runs through Jan. 16. Interested parties will also be allowed to comment in person before an administrative law judge in Duluth on Dec. 19. Officials with Enbridge, based in Calgary, Alberta, welcomed the report. They told reporters that if the Public Utilities Commission deems the update adequate, they hope to start construction of the Minnesota and North Dakota segments of the replacement pipeline in mid-2020. Construction would then take seven to nine months. The upgraded Canadian and Wisconsin segments are already in service. Enbridge estimates that the 350-mile Minnesota segment will cost $2.6 billion, with the entire U.S. segment costing $2.9 billion. The hypothetical modeling considered what would happen in the event of a ruptured pipeline at full flow near the creek if Enbridge failed to fight the spill within 24 hours — essentially a worst-case scenario. Enbridge officials said their actual response would include immediate and aggressive moves to address the spill and begin the cleanup. The report said some oil might float down the St. Louis River to a dam where it would mix with the turbulent water. It said the most significant environmental impact would be potential short-term effects on fish right below the dam due to toxic components in the oil. But past the dam, it said, any oil remaining on the surface after 24 hours would likely wash up on shore without reaching Lake Superior. “The modeling confirms there is no introduction of risk to Lake Superior with a crude oil release,” project director Barry Simonson said on a conference call with reporters. Climate change activists said the updated review didn’t go far enough. “The PUC has produced yet another inadequate review that fails to recognize that this pipeline would pose an unacceptable risk to Minnesota’s clean water and should never be built,” said Margaret Levin, director of the Sierra Club’s Minnesota chapter. “Now it’s more important than ever that Governor (Tim) Walz and the Pollution Control Agency do everything in their power to stop this dirty tar sands pipeline once and for all.” MARQUETTE — The Marquette County Health Department has announced the first confirmed positive COVID-19 case in ...

 Nov 9, 2019 In this undated photo provided by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a group of people take a walk through the Eagle Ridge project area, located east of Midland. Dow Chemical Co. has agreed to fund environmental restoration projects worth an estimated $77 million to compensate for decades of pollution by its plant in Midland, officials said Friday TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — Dow Chemical Co. has agreed to fund environmental restoration projects worth an estimated $77 million to compensate for decades of pollution by its plant in Midland, Michigan, officials said Friday. A deal between the company and government agencies calls for improvements to fish and wildlife habitats tainted by dioxins and other hazardous substances from Dow’s manufacturing complex in its headquarters city of Midland. The chemical giant also will pay for new public recreation areas with trails, fishing platforms and boating launches. “This settlement has been more than a decade in the making by a combined team of state, federal and tribal partners working together for the benefit of Michigan’s environment and precious natural resources,” state Attorney General Dana Nessel said. The agreement would be legally binding and needs a federal judge’s approval to take effect. It would resolve a complaint filed by government agencies that alleges the company’s pollution harmed birds, fish, invertebrates and mammals in the Tittabawassee and Saginaw rivers and their watersheds. Dow’s facility began operating in 1897. For generations it dumped or incinerated wastes that contaminated the 50-mile-long river valley, which extends into Lake Huron’s Saginaw Bay, with dioxins and related compounds linked to cancer and other illnesses. Cleanup of the Tittabawassee River began in 2007 and is expected to be finished in 2021. No completion date has been set for the other waterways. The pollution has prompted warnings to limit consumption of some fish and wild game, and to avoid touching the soil in certain areas, including parks. Under the agreement, Dow will pay for 13 natural resource projects in Midland, Saginaw and Bay counties that will affect a combined 8,000 acres. Construction of a fish passage ramp at a Tittabawassee River dam will provide hundreds of miles of new habitat for migratory species, while the state Department of Natural Resources will get funding to build spawning reefs in Saginaw Bay. Other projects will protect and restore wetlands, farmlands and forests. About 2,000 acres of private land will be shielded from development through conservation easements. An expansion of the Shiawassee National Wildlife Reserve will provide more room for hunting. Biking and nature trails will be developed in preserved Tittabawassee flood plain areas habitat south of Midland. As part of the settlement, Dow will pay $15 million to a team of trustees including officials with state and federal agencies and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan. Some of the money will be used to maintain and monitor the effectiveness of the 13 projects, while at least $5 million will fund additional natural resource initiatives selected by the trustees with advice from the public. Dow also will reimburse government agencies for costs of studying how its pollution affected the environment. In a statement, the company said it was “committed to working cooperatively with the … trustees to move forward with implementation of the proposed restoration plan over the next five years” and had set aside money to pay for the settlement. The trustees will host a public meeting Nov. 21 in Saginaw to provide more details about the plan, said Matthew Schneider, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. “We are thankful to Dow and the trustees for their work in reaching this excellent result, which will benefit the residents of the Saginaw Bay area and the wildlife and waterfowl that inhabit it,” Schneider said.

 Jul 30, 2019 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Gov. Tony Evers on Monday created a new position in state government to coordinate Wisconsin’s efforts at combatting lead in drinking water, the same day he joined with other Great Lakes governors to promote healthier water supplies. Evers signed an executive order in Kenosha creating the lead pollution czar within the state Department of Health Services. No one was immediately named to the post. Evers created the job the same day he and four other governors in the Great Lakes region urged candidates in next year’s presidential election to support a plan for safeguarding their shared waters by boosting federal spending on treatment plants and environmental cleanups. Evers has declared 2019 the year of clean drinking water. While lead in Milwaukee’s water supply has gotten a lot of attention, Evers said every Wisconsin community is threatened. “The Department of Health Services has identified lead-poisoned children in every single county in Wisconsin,” Evers said in a statement. “We know that it will take a collaborative effort to ensure that everyone is able to drink clean water from their tap.” Under his order, all state agencies are being charged to work together with the new lead pollution czar to address what Evers is calling “Wisconsin’s lead crisis.” Since 1996, more than 220,000 children across Wisconsin have been identified as having a dangerous amount of lead in their body, according to studies by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. It is estimated that more than 176,000 lead service lines across the state are providing contaminated drinking water to homes and businesses. Creating the new position won praise from environmentalists who have been pressuring policy makers to act on lead issues for years. Republicans who control the Legislature balked earlier this year at an Evers plan to spend $40 million to replace lead service lines, because they feared too much of the money would go toward Milwaukee. “Unfortunately — and inaccurately — some politicians have used children’s health as a way to polarize voters,” said Wisconsin Conservation Voters executive director Kerry Schumann. “The truth is, lead exposure via drinking water is a serious problem in rural, suburban, and urban communities across the state.” Schumann said creating the lead pollution coordinator will allow the state to begin addressing the problem in a comprehensive way.

 Jul 15, 2019 HOUGHTON – The Torch Lake Public Action Council will host a statewide Public Advisory Council meeting in Houghton on Tuesday and Wednesday. Sessions are scheduled from 8:30 a.m. until noon both days at Michigan Technological University’s Great Lakes Research Center in Room 202. In addition, there will be a tour of Torch Lake on Tuesday after the end of the morning session. The Michigan Office of Great Lakes staff who assist the SPAC will be in attendance to update the council on state and federal actions that affect progress of cleanups in the Great Lakes. Areas of Concern are highly polluted sites on bodies of water that pose a danger to their communities. There were originally 14 Areas of Concern in Michigan. The pollution problems of AOCs are specifically identified as Beneficial Use Impairment for each AOC. According to the Upper Peninsula Environmental Coalition, the role of a public advisory council is to identify the problems, do community outreach and develop a network of government and non-governmental groups to address the concerns of communities. Torch Lake has recently been active in seeking solutions to the stamp sands dumped into the lake by former mining companies. The pollution has made it difficult to have a healthy benthos, or aquatic life, due to the spread of sands throughout the bottom of the lake. New efforts are underway to revive Torch Lake’s benthos that could lead to a major cleanup within the next decade. Along with the work being done by the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy Remediation Division to remove toxic chemicals along the west shore of Torch Lake, funding is being sought from the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to find ways to repair the damage created by copper mining companies since the latter part of the 19th century. The public is invited to the SPAC meeting on both days to hear about progress being made by advisory councils across the state. The OGL and the Great Lakes Commission will update council members on state, federal and international activities. Research currently being done at the University of Michigan and Michigan Technological University will also inform council members of effective ways to engage their communities. The Keweenaw Bay Indian Community will have its president, Chris Swartz, explain the importance of Torch Lake to their community under their treaty rights and the work they have done to improve water quality on their reservation. SPAC meetings are an opportunity for members to network and to find out not only what concerns an AOC has, but also to see the host community and its attractions.

 Jun 28, 2019 MILWAUKEE (AP) — The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Canada-based Enbridge Energy doesn’t need to carry additional insurance for a pipeline project in Dane County, despite the local government’s insistence that it do so in case of an accidental spill. Dane County officials made a $25 million environmental liability policy a requirement for Enbridge’s permit for a project to triple the flow of crude oil from its Line 61 pipeline to 1.2 million barrels per day. The pipeline runs from northern Wisconsin to Illinois. The Court’s conservative majority ruled in favor of Enbridge 4-1, with two liberal justices abstaining. Dane County approved the permit in 2015 with the insurance requirement. In asking for additional insurance, Dane County officials cited the 2010 Enbridge oil spill in southwest Michigan that cost $1.2 billion and has resulted in ongoing insurance litigation. In that case, the U.S. government fined Enbridge more than $1.8 million after accusing the company of missing deadlines for pipeline inspections following the gigantic oil spill that polluted nearly 40 miles of the Kalamazoo River, shorelines and wetlands. Cleanup lasted four years. Enbridge appealed Dane County’s insurance requirement, but Wisconsin lawmakers intervened before the company’s challenge was decided, passing a last-minute provision in the state budget that blocked municipalities from imposing additional liability requirements when a pipeline operator already carries comprehensive insurance. Dane County required the extra insurance anyway, prompting Enbridge to appeal at the circuit court level, where they won, only to have an appeals court decide that Enbridge hadn’t proven it carried enough insurance. The high court reversed that Thursday, writing that Enbridge already had sufficient insurance. “Enbridge is pleased with the decision of the Supreme Court to uphold the Dane County Circuit Court’s decision to strike unenforceable insurance requirements from the (conditional use permit),” Enbridge spokeswoman Jennifer Smith said in a statement. While the court battle played out, Enbridge finished its $1.5 billion upgrade to its pipeline and built the needed pumping station, since state lawmakers made Dane County’s requirement unenforceable. “The Waterloo pump station is critical infrastructure for the state of Wisconsin and for the region, helping to ensure a reliable source of energy for decades to come,” Smith said. Enbridge has said that it has $860 million worth of general liability insurance that includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution, but the county and landowners involved in the case say the company hasn’t provided sufficient proof. An attorney for Dane County, David Gault, called the court’s ruling “primarily the result of an ill-conceived and poorly worded special interest statute.” Patricia Hammel, one of the attorneys representing the landowners, said in a statement that the court’s “decision allows Enbridge to operate the largest tar sands pipeline in the U.S across Wisconsin without adequate insurance and exposes our people, land and water to the consequences of a catastrophic spill.” In ruling in favor of Enbridge, the conservative justices concluded that lawmakers “rendered Dane County’s extra insurance conditions unenforceable, and the proper remedy is to strike the illegal conditions.” Dissenting from the majority, Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, echoed the arguments from landowners and the county, saying that Enbridge has not shown that it carries the needed insurance that would make what the county is asking for moot. Enbridge has disputed that claim. Enbridge, which operates Line 3 in Minnesota, is going through a legal battle there as well as it tries to replace the aging crude oil pipeline that runs through the northern part of the state. Earlier this month, two state agencies said they would hold up approval of the project’s permits until problems with its environmental review are resolved.

 Jun 12, 2019 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Republicans on the Legislature’s budget-writing committee approved money Tuesday to begin building a new prison in Green Bay but eliminated funding to construct new state facilities to house juvenile offenders after Wisconsin’s troubled youth prison closes, shifting those dollars to counties and raising questions about the state’s role in housing young offenders. The committee made the moves as it nears completion on revisions to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ state budget. The panel expects to wrap up its work Thursday by inserting tax cuts in the spending plan. The budget will then go to the full Legislature. Evers’ budget called for spending $2.5 billion on construction projects around the state. Republican committee members dumped that plan Tuesday evening, voting instead to spend about $1.9 billion. The GOP plan sets out $5 million to purchase land and start the bidding process to build a new prison to replace the aging Green Bay Correctional Institution. Evers’ construction budget didn’t include any plans for a new prison, but Republicans have been pushing for a new facility in Green Bay for months. The Republican plan also makes dramatic changes to bipartisan plans to close the youth prison outside Irma. The prison has been plagued by allegations of guard-on-prisoner abuse for years. An FBI investigation ended this past April with no criminal charges, but the prison has been at the center of multiple lawsuits, including one that resulted in a federal judge ordering sweeping reductions in the use of pepper spray, solitary confinement and shackles. The Legislature last year unanimously passed a bill requiring the Department of Corrections to close the facility by January 2021. The bill authorized $25 million in borrowing to build regional state juvenile detention facilities, $15 million in borrowing to expand the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center and $40 million in borrowing to fund grants for counties to build their own juvenile detention centers. Evers has said the Department of Corrections can’t get the replacement facilities built before 2021. His construction budget included an additional $194 million for the facilities. Republicans on the committee walked that back dramatically Tuesday, setting out only $44 million for the Mendota expansion. They also shifted all borrowing authority laid out in the 2018 bill for state facilities to the counties. The move left state Rep. Evan Goyke, a Democratic finance committee member who co-sponsored the closure bill, flabbergasted. “What do you want? Another study? What are you waiting for? You think we won’t need a facility for juveniles at all? Is that what you’re saying?” he said. “Look, the plan passed unanimously a year ago. This (plan) presses pause.” Republicans didn’t offer a direct explanation for the move. Republican Rep. Mark Born said he understands Goyle’s concerns but the state facilities are still in the pipeline and corrections officials can continue to work on them. Evers’ budget would have supplied $1.1 billion in additional funding for University of Wisconsin System building projects. Republicans on Tuesday scaled that back to about $1 billion. They earmarked $31.7 million for classroom renovations, down from the $38 million Evers proposed, but retained his plans to spend $125 million on Camp Randall Stadium and Kohl Center upgrades. The only UW projects that received no money under the Republican plan were plans to finish work on a new science hall and upgrade dorms at UW-La Crosse. In other action Tuesday the panel approved Evers’ proposal to extend the Department of Natural Resources’ stewardship program through mid-2022. The DNR uses borrowing authority under the program to purchase land for preservation and recreation. The committee, however, scrapped the governor’s plan to raise factory farms’ pollution permit fees from $345 to $660 and impose a new $3,270 fee on the farms payable every five years. The committee is now all but finished with its revisions to the budget. The panel plans to reconvene Thursday morning to insert the tax cuts into the spending plan. Republicans are eying a roughly $400 million middle class income tax cut but have not released details about how it would be paid for or what it would mean for the average taxpayer. The budget committee planned to vote on that Thursday. Evers and Republicans have been at odds since even before the governor took office. Republicans called a lame-duck session to weaken his powers, and neither side has shown a willingness to give on any significant items in the budget. Evers has powerful partial veto powers, which he can use to craft the Republican-approved budget into something more palatable to Democrats. But he also hasn’t ruled out vetoing the entire budget, which would require both sides to start from scratch. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos warned Evers on Tuesday that if he vetoes the entire budget the GOP will simply reduce spending on health and transportation in subsequent proposals. Republicans wouldn’t take any budget-related action in the summer, waiting instead until October to attempt override votes. Republicans would need to convince Democrats to vote with them to be able to override any veto. Wisconsin’s current budget runs through June 30. If there is no deal enacted by July 1, there would not be a government shutdown like occurred at the federal level and in other states. Instead, in Wisconsin current funding levels continue until there is a new budget enacted. MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Gov.

url: https://www.ironmountaindailynews.com/news/2019/05/panel-votes-to-continue-uw-tuition-freeze/
 May 29, 2019 MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Legislature’s Republican-controlled budget committee voted Tuesday to continue a University of Wisconsin tuition freeze for another two years and give the system about $58 million in additional state money, less than half as much as Democratic Gov. Tony Evers wanted and funding that comes with a catch. Evers had called for nearly a $127 million increase in state funding for the university, money that Democrats said was needed to help deal with budget cuts under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker and address high-need areas like nursing and high-tech jobs. But they didn’t have the votes to overcome Republican support for a smaller increase, $45 million of which will only be turned over if the Legislature approves UW’s plan for spending it. UW President Ray Cross said after the vote he felt like he had been “kicked in the shins.” Cross said it would take $60 million just to keep pace with inflation and called the committee’s decision “kind of shocking” and “very short sighted.” “I’m really frustrated and disappointed,” Cross said. But Republican committee co-chair Rep. John Nygren, of Marinette, defended the smaller increase, saying “There will always be a desire from some to spend more.” The panel is working to complete revisions to the Evers budget before sending it to the full Legislature for consideration, likely in June. Democrats don’t have the votes to stop what Republicans approve, but Evers does have the power to make changes with his broad veto power. The tuition freeze began under Walker and is now in its sixth year. Evers proposed extending it for two more, but asked for $50.4 million to pay for it. Republicans rejected that request to pay for it. The committee also rejected Evers proposals to give UW $45 million to attract and retain students in high-demand areas and spend $10 million to pay for a program that would establish fellowships and loan programs for nursing students who commit to teach for three years in the university’s nursing program, a move to address teaching shortfalls. “The Legislature missed an opportunity to meet the future needs of the state,” Cross said. In the area of natural resources, Republicans approved creating two new scientist positions at the Department of Natural Resources, less than the five Evers wanted. Evers wanted to restore five of 18 research scientist positions cut by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature in 2015. The cuts were done to stop the department from studying climate change and the impact of mining on pollution as Walker and legislative Republicans were trying to lure a mining company to the state. The two new positions Republicans approved would be charged with researching water pollution, particularly from polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Those are man-made chemicals are contaminants involved in a variety of industrial and consumer products, including fast-food wrappers and stain-resistant sprays. Contamination from PFAS has been documented in over 170 sites in 40 states, including Wisconsin. But the state DNR said it can’t engage in research or provide information about PFAS contamination in the state without additional staff. Democrats have introduced a bill calling on the DNR to set standards for the contaminant in drinking water, groundwater, surface water, air and soil, and to establish monitoring requirements. Republicans have a more limited bill dealing only with limiting the use of PFAS in firefighting foam. The budget committee approved spending $200,000 on determining the extent and locations of PFAS contamination in Wisconsin. The committee also voted to: — Increase by $4 million the amount of borrowing authority to pay for cleaning up contaminated sediment from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan and their tributaries. That is $21 million less than Evers wanted. — increase reimbursement rates for private attorneys who offer public defender services from $40 to $70 per hour by 2020, a move designed to address a shortage of attorneys willing to take the cases. Wisconsin’s reimbursement rate, which hasn’t changed since 1995, is the lowest in the country. — raise the salaries of public defenders and prosecutors by 2% each of the next two years, in line with what other state employees receive. — add 34 assistant district attorney positions across the state.

(Journal photo by Trinity Carey) A glass bottle is returned at a recycling station. In October, the MCSWMA will begin collecting glass to be processed and potentially used for mine backfill, an additive in concrete and asphalt and more. (Journal photo by Trinity Carey) MARQUETTE — According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 11.4 million tons of glass was generated in 2017, representing a total of 4.2% of all municipal solid waste generation. Just 3 million tons of that glass was recycled that year, while 6.9 million tons of glass were sent to landfills, making the glass recycling rate around 26.6%. To develop a sustainable and economical landfill facility and produce a range of glass products, the Marquette County Solid Waste Management Authority and professors from Michigan Tech will meet with state legislators and officials at 4 p.m. March 20, in the landfill boardroom to present proposed research on glass repurposing and to seek funding from the State of Michigan. State Rep. Sara Cambensy, D-Marquette; state Rep. Beau LaFave, R-Iron Mountain; state Sen. Ed McBroom, R-Vulcan; state Rep. Greg Markkanen, R-Houghton and others will be present. With the MCSWMA’s switch to single-stream recycling in October, will come its ability to receive and repurpose glass into various materials. The authority hopes to receive state funding so Tech can further pursue the proposed research and overall establish the efficacy of glass recycling into value-added products, the project overview states. “We’re probably looking at $1 million over that three-year period, so basically what we’ll be recommending to them is like $500,000 the first year, $300,000 or $400,000 the second year and either $100,000 or $200,000 the third year depending on how that works out,” said MCSWMA Board of Trustees Chairman Randy Yelle. “That’s our very first step and that has to happen before we can even consider taking region one (the Upper Peninsula) glass. If this goes into place, we will open up and take every bit of glass we can get from the whole U.P. and we’re centrally located.” A glass bottle is returned at a recycling station. In October, the MCSWMA will begin collecting glass to be processed and potentially used for mine backfill, an additive in concrete and asphalt and more. (Journal photo by Trinity Carey) The authority is “asking for funding from wherever,” said Bill Nordeen, legal counsel for the MCSWMA. “We want the state of Michigan to fund Michigan Tech’s research so they can go out and certify the different possibilities and we can get rid of our glass.” While asking for funding from wherever available, Nordeen has identified funds from the Michigan Deposit Bottle Law escheat, or the unclaimed deposits reverted to the state, that could be used to fund the research. “It turns out that when you and I and everybody else, we go and buy a 12-pack of beer at the store and we pay a deposit on those cans, some people don’t return their cans,” Nordeen said. “So say we throw them in the garbage what happens to all the dimes that we paid?” According to the Michigan Bottle Deposit Law, 75% of the money from unclaimed deposits is deposited into the Cleanup and Redevelopment Trust Fund and 25% is returned to retailers. Of the 75% deposited into the trust fund, 80% is deposited into the Cleanup and Redevelopment Fund and 10% is deposited into the Community Prevention and Pollution Fund. The other 10% remains in the trust fund. The $800,000 grant awarded to the MCSWMA from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy for the authority’s recycling project came from this fund. “Last year we went to the Legislature, to EGLE, and said: ‘Listen, what better way to spend the money on these items that were not turned back in, than on recycling, which is trying to keep these things from going to the landfill,” Nordeen said. “That was our last year’s pitch. Our pitch this year is: ‘What better way to spend it than to try to figure out what to do with the glass?’ Many of those deposits were glass bottles.” Documents from the authority and MTU note that glass is the most difficult material present in municipal solid waste to find a suitable market for. “To be economically feasible, recycled glass needs to be used in local markets or needs to be processed to a level where significant value-added results, which justifies higher transportation costs for both the source materials and the products. In the case of the new single-stream Material Recovery Facility being commissioned by the MCSWMA, located in Marquette, MI, the issues of transportation to potential markets is even more acute,” documents state. If granted funding, MTU plans to research the possible uses for repurposed glass, including: ≤ Mine backfill using coarse product: Once ore is extracted from a mine it is refilled with crushed rock derived from original tunnels drove into the mine. Other materials will eventually be needed, the research concept states, and crushed glass could be used in its place. ≤ Using the coarse glass product as aggregate: The concept noted that aggregate supply is a challenge nationwide, but recycled glass may be a viable alternative in asphalt or fill material. ≤ Using the fine glass product in concrete: The glass product could be used in portland cement concrete or the basic ingredient in concrete. ≤ Using the fine glass product as an abrasive: Glass is used as an abrasive in some industrial applications like sandblasting. The research of these possible applications has been broken down into five general areas of study to be conducted over a three-year time period. Tech will conduct an economic and sustainability assessment, geotechnical testing and research, asphalt testing and research, concrete testing and research and design of the required processing facility. Specific topics to be addressed throughout these areas of research include looking at the availability of glass in the waste stream serviced by the MCSWMA, testing the long term performance of glass in asphalt and concrete mixtures and more. Certification from MTU would make the glass processed by the MCSWMA more marketable to manufacturers, Yelle said. “We need the help from the community to participate in the recycling program and we need them to separate their glass from the single-stream. And the reason for that is if you’ve got them together, the glass will contaminate the paper and cardboard. And then we can’t get rid of them and they go to the landfill,” he said. Removing glass from the landfill will overall extend the life of the landfill which currently has just over 50 years of life. “The recycling program as projected will add 10 to 12 years per cell to the life of the landfill. There are currently five cells left,” Yelle said. “We could end up with 80, 100 years of life at the landfill. It all depends on the participation we get from the residents.” Yelle is hoping for the support of legislators at the meeting as he is confident once the research is conducted, markets would support the authority’s processing of glass. “We need the financial support to finish out this research,” Yelle said. “Glass, I mean, that takes up a lot of space.” Trinity Carey can be reached at 906-228-2500, ext. 206.

 Feb 29, 2020 To the Journal editor: In recent years, I have become increasingly aware of the increased use of plastics, as well as the negative impacts of plastic. It is used for packaging food, beverages, cleaning supplies, cosmetics and electronic(to name a few) as well as a component in our toys, cars, dishes, clothing, shoes etc. The list is seemingly endless. The problem is plastics do not biodegrade and contain many chemicals. Plastics pollute woods and waterways. They break into smaller and smaller pieces, and wild animals can become entangles in plastic or eat the pieces. I notice more and more plastic garbage on our Great Lakes beaches and in our woods. Some of our congressional members have identified this problem and introduced the Break Free from Plastic Pollution Act [S.3263 in the Senate/H.R. 5845 in the House]. This bill works to reduce non-recyclable plastic items and encourage the improved recovery of recyclable plastic materials. This bill works to end the health threats of pollution from petrochemical plants on communities and tasks federal agencies to develop comprehensive plans to address plastic pollution in our waterways. This is a historic effort that will spur innovation and investments in the United States’ domestic recycling and composting infrastructure. Please urge your senators and representatives to support this bill for people and our woods and water!

 Feb 28, 2020 TRAVERSE CITY (AP) — A Michigan oversight panel Thursday endorsed drinking water standards designed to limit exposure to a group of household and industrial chemicals linked to a variety of health problems. The proposed rules would apply to seven compounds in a category known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. They have been used for decades in products ranging from nonstick cookware to stain-resistant clothing and food containers, as well as foam used to extinguish jet-fuel fires. They’re known as “forever chemicals” because they persist indefinitely in the environment without breaking down. Members of Congress announced Thursday the Air Force would spend $13.5 million cleaning up PFAS water pollution near the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda, Michigan. Thousands of PFAS compounds have been developed. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy crafted drinking water standards for just seven because they’re the only ones for which there is enough scientific data to justify regulation, spokesman Scott Dean said. Their acceptance by the Environmental Rules Review Committee was a key step. The state legislature established the panel in 2018 at the urging of Republicans who described it as a check on excessively burdensome regulation. Among its members are representatives of business and industry sectors including oil and gas, agriculture and manufacturing. At their urging, the panel delayed action on the PFAS rules last fall. But it approved the proposals Thursday on a 8-0 vote, with two members abstaining. The decision “shows there is broad support for rules that protect Michiganders from contaminants in their drinking water,” said Liesl Clark, director of the environment department. The rules still need approval of the legislature’s Joint Committee on Administrative Rules before taking effect. They would cover about 2,700 drinking water systems, requiring them to conduct periodic testing and inform the public of results. The environment department forwarded its proposals to the oversight panel last October. The panel considered them in two meetings and took public feedback. While the overwhelming majority of written comments were supportive, some raised concern about the costs of meeting the standards or said the rules were put together too quickly. Smaller drinking water suppliers “don’t have the ability to pass that cost along on any non-painful way to ratepayers,” Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau, said during Thursday’s meeting in Lansing. John Dulmes, executive director of the Michigan Chemistry Council, said the department hadn’t provided enough scientific justification for some of the provisions. Gov.

 Jan 11, 2020 MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich. (AP) — An industrial site in suburban Detroit from which a greenish stream of contaminated water leaked onto a freeway will be considered for the federal Superfund cleanup program, Michigan officials said Friday. The state Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said an evaluation of the Electro-Plating Services Inc. site will be completed this spring. It will be based on dozens of soil and water samples being taken by the department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The chrome plating company in Madison Heights was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste. An EPA cleanup removed toxic chemicals and contaminated liquids. The leak of bright green goo onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 last month prompted a new investigation. It found high levels of numerous toxins in soil and groundwater at the site, including hexavalent chromium, which is associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage. The Superfund program enables EPA to arrange cleanup of highly contaminated sites by requiring polluters to pay for the work or using government funds when responsible parties can’t be found. Michigan officials said Friday they also had detected high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, in water collected by a sump pump in the facility’s basement. PFAS are chemicals used in a wide variety of industrial and household products that have been linked to kidney and liver damage, thyroid disease, fertility problems and low birth weight. The Michigan agency said water sampled from the basement pit contained levels of one PFAS compound, known as PFOS, at a level of 742 parts per trillion, far exceeding Michigan’s groundwater standard of 70 ppt. The environmental department said the recovered water will be treated to remove the compounds and other pollution before disposal. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday issued a three-week order that residents stay at home and not gather in public or ... ST.

 Jan 3, 2020 FILE - In this Oct. 12, 2018 file photo, water contaminated with arsenic, lead and zinc flows from a pipe out of the Lee Mountain mine and into a holding pond near Rimini, Mont. The community is part of the Upper Tenmile Creek Superfund site, where dozens of abandoned mines have left water supplies polluted and residents must use bottled water. The Trump administration has built up the largest backlog of unfunded toxic Superfund projects awaiting clean-up in at least 15 years, nearly tripling the number of sites where clean-ups are ready to go but awaiting money, according to 2019 figures quietly released by the Environmental Protection Agency over the winter holidays. (AP Photo/Matthew Brown) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has built up the biggest backlog of unfunded toxic Superfund clean-up projects in at least 15 years, nearly triple the number that were stalled for lack of money in the Obama era, according to 2019 figures quietly released by the Environmental Protection Agency over the winter holidays. The accumulation of Superfund projects that are ready to go except for money comes as the Trump administration routinely proposes funding cuts for Superfund and for the EPA in general. The four-decade-old Superfund program is meant to tackle some of the most heavily contaminated sites in the U.S. and Trump has declared it a priority even while seeking to shrink its budget. “There hasn’t been a sense of urgency,” said Violet Donoghue, who has lived for 31 years on Bon Brae Street in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. Toxic PCBs have poisoned some local soil, water and fish at nearby Lake St. Clair, and the neighborhood is one of the 34 Superfund sites where clean-up projects languished for lack of money in 2019. “I feel many people have been harmed, but that’s only my opinion,” Donoghue said. She said the last word from the EPA was that soil would be removed from the front of her house. “Now when they say they’re cleaning it, I say, ‘OK, give me the date,'” she said. The unfunded projects are in 17 states and Puerto Rico. They range from abandoned mines that discharged heavy metals and arsenic in the West to an old wood pulp site in Mississippi and a defunct dry cleaner that released toxic solvents in North Carolina. Congress created the Superfund program in 1980 after the Love Canal episode and other notorious pollution cases. Its intent is to hold polluters responsible for cleanup costs or provide taxpayer money when no responsible party can be identified. Trump “is focused on putting Americans first,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told a Senate environment committee early 2019. “There may be no better example than our success in the Superfund program.” “We are in the process of cleaning up some of the nation’s largest, most complex sites and returning them to productive use,” Wheeler said then. But two former EPA officials whose work dealt with Superfund oversight said the growing backlog of stalled Superfund projects under the Trump administration, and steady or ebbing numbers of clean-up construction projects completed, point to a different picture. “They’re misleading Congress and the public about the funds that are needed to really protect the public from exposure to the toxic chemicals,” said Elizabeth Southerland, who worked for 30 years at EPA, including as director of science and technology in the water office, before retiring in 2017. “It’s detrimental.” This is a “regulatory failure,” said Judith Enck, who served as the EPA’s regional northeastern U.S. administrator under President Barack Obama. Given the growing numbers of unfunded clean-up projects, “EPA should be knocking on the door of Congress and saying, give us more money to deal with the sites,” Enck said. Asked what the EPA spent money on instead, and why the agency didn’t ask Congress for more to deal with the growing backlog, EPA spokeswoman Maggie Sauerhage offered few specifics Thursday. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday issued a three-week order that residents stay at home and not gather in public or ... ST.

The discovery led to an investigation of an old industrial site near the interstate. State regulators said high levels of multiple contaminants have been found in soil and groundwater around the former Electro-Plating Services. (Michigan Department of Transportation via AP) LANSING, Mich. — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday ordered Michigan’s environmental agency to review its pollution-inspection procedures after the discovery of a bright green substance along the shoulder of a major interstate in suburban Detroit. Whitmer called the ooze — groundwater contaminated by industrial waste from Electro-Plating Services in Madison Heights — “very concerning” and said it shows the need for “broad reforms” to address underfunding and understaffing at the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy following eight years of one-party control in Lansing. The Democrat urged the Republican-led Legislature to help better fund the agency and to pass stalled Democratic-sponsored legislation to ensure polluters pay for cleanup. “Working with federal and local partners, my administration will stay focused on cleaning up contaminated sites sooner, addressing root causes and holding polluters accountable,” Whitmer said in a statement. She ordered EGLE to formally review its pollution-inspection procedures to strengthen enforcement and accountability. High levels of multiple contaminants were found in soil and groundwater at the site when an inspection was triggered after the brightly colored goo was seen Dec. 20 seeping through a concrete barrier along Interstate 696. Electro-Plating Services was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste, after nearly 50 years of operation, and Madison Heights revoked the company’s occupancy permit. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducted a cleanup in 2017, removing toxic chemicals and pumping contaminated liquid from an earthen pit, but it “was not intended to address all environmental impacts,” the state has said. In November, Electro-Plating was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay nearly $1.5 million in cleanup costs to the EPA. The owner, Gary Sayers, 77, was given a year in federal prison for illegally storing hazardous waste. In 2005, he had pleaded guilty in state court to illegally transporting hazardous waste. Gov.

 Dec 30, 2019 Although it should have come as no surprise to anyone, a recent federal study has linked increased beach trash with a decrease in tourist use. Put another way, the more garbage on beaches, the less those beaches — and surrounding businesses — are frequented by visitors. The study, by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, noted plastic pollution of all sorts and balloon debris have a great impact on Great Lakes tourism. “Tourism is a major economic sector along the coast,” said Ya’el Seid-Green, a communications and policy specialist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Debris Program. “So, the results of this study can inform future cleanup projects.” Beach trash, according to NOAA, includes plastic, straws, metal, paper, textiles and fishing gear. Bird feathers, campfire litter, microplastics and neglected boats also fall into this category. The researchers interviewed about 1,300 beachgoers and emailed them a follow-up survey. Although Lake Erie was the focus of the study among the Great Lakes, it’s reasonable to conclude the results can be applied to a broader context. It’s impossible to calculate the total amount of litter in the Great Lakes. But, during 2015 beach cleanups, the Alliance for the Great Lakes reported 46.3 tons of marine debris collected in the region, an astounding amount. Our advice? That’s easy. Anytime you visit the beach, pick up trash — any trash — that you find. You’ll not only be helping the environment, you’ll be supporting the local economy. Both are good things.

 Dec 27, 2019 Trash on Ohio’s Crane Creek State Park beach along Lake Erie is pictured. (Photo courtesy of Benny Mazur via Flickr) LANSING — A nice day at the beach could be ruined by a single drinking straw. The more litter on the beach, the fewer days visitors spend at it, according to a recent study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And fewer tourist days means less money for local economy and eventually a decrease in local jobs. The study reports that plastic pollution and balloon debris have a great impact on Great Lakes tourism. In Lake Erie, the doubling of litter would discourage more than a third of visitors from visiting the beach again, the study said. “Tourism is a major economic sector along the coast,” said Ya’el Seid-Green, a communications and policy specialist at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Debris Program. “So, the results of this study can inform future cleanup projects.” The researchers also looked at the economic effect of litter on the Gulf Coast beaches in Alabama, the Atlantic Ocean beaches in Delaware and Maryland and the Pacific Ocean beaches in Orange County, California. They examined the effects of marine debris on beach recreation and the local economy. Marine debris, according to NOAA, could be plastic straws, metal, paper, textile and fishing gear. Bird feathers, campfire litter, microplastics and neglected boats also fall into this category. The researchers interviewed about 1,300 beachgoers and emailed them a follow-up survey. They were asked to rate how much trash they saw on a scale of 1 to 5. A 1 corresponded to one piece of debris per 500 square feet. A score of 5 meant 16 pieces of debris per 500 square feet. “Ohio beaches have the highest levels of debris, while Alabama and Delaware/Maryland have comparatively low levels of debris,” the study said. Ohio scored 2.3 on average and Orange County, California, scored 2.1. Meanwhile, Alabama and Delaware/Maryland scored 1.7 and 1.6 respectively. Other Great Lakes states were not part of the study. Each year, about 8 million trips are made to Lake Erie, the report said. People spend about $96 on average per day during those visits. Of that amount, $73 was added to the local economy in the form of jobs and earnings for local establishments. Tourists near Lake Erie spent around $1.9 billion in 2015 alone, according to Lake Erie Shores & Island, a marketing organization for the region. The number increased to $2.12 billion in 2017. The organization said that almost 14,000 people in the region are employed in tourism-related jobs. But if the amount of litter doubled, the Lake Erie region would lose $218 million in tourism revenue, according to the NOAA study. It would also cost the local economy 3,700 jobs. It’s impossible to calculate the total amount of litter in the Great Lakes. But, during 2015 beach cleanups, the Chicago-based Alliance for the Great Lakes reported 46.3 tons of marine debris collected in the region. More than a third was collected in Ohio and Pennsylvania, which border Lake Erie. Midway through 2019, volunteers from the Alliance of the Great Lakes collected 54,000 pounds of litter from Great Lakes beaches, said Jennifer Caddick, the vice president of communications and engagement for the organization. At least 90% contained plastic. Tourism shouldn’t be the only reason to keep the lakes free from pollution, especially when algae threatens Lake Erie every year, Caddick said. “It’s important to remember that the Great Lakes provide drinking water for approximately 40 million Americans and Canadians, which is a critical reason to keep them pollution-free,” she said.

 Jul 18, 2017 LOWELL, Mass. (AP) — They hide in weeds along hiking trails and in playground grass. They wash into rivers and float downstream to land on beaches. They pepper baseball dugouts, sidewalks and streets. Syringes left by drug users amid the heroin crisis are turning up everywhere. In Portland, Maine, officials have collected more than 700 needles so far this year, putting them on track to handily exceed the nearly 900 gathered in all of 2016. In March alone, San Francisco collected more than 13,000 syringes, compared with only about 2,900 the same month in 2016. People, often children, risk getting stuck by discarded needles, raising the prospect they could contract blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis or HIV or be exposed to remnants of heroin or other drugs. It’s unclear whether anyone has gotten sick, but the reports of children finding the needles can be sickening in their own right. One 6-year-old girl in California mistook a discarded syringe for a thermometer and put it in her mouth; she was unharmed. “I just want more awareness that this is happening,” said Nancy Holmes, whose 11-year-old daughter stepped on a needle in Santa Cruz, California, while swimming. “You would hear stories about finding needles at the beach or being poked at the beach. But you think that it wouldn’t happen to you. Sure enough.” They are a growing problem in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, two states that have seen many overdose deaths in recent years. “We would certainly characterize this as a health hazard,” said Tim Soucy, health director in Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city, which collected 570 needles in 2016, the first year it began tracking the problem. It has found 247 needles so far this year. Needles turn up in places like parks, baseball diamonds, trails and beaches — isolated spots where drug users can gather and attract little attention, and often the same spots used by the public for recreation. The needles are tossed out of carelessness or the fear of being prosecuted for possessing them. One child was poked by a needle left on the grounds of a Utah elementary school. Another youngster stepped on one while playing on a beach in New Hampshire. Even if adults or children don’t get sick, they still must endure an unsettling battery of tests to make sure they didn’t catch anything. The girl who put a syringe in her mouth was not poked but had to be tested for hepatitis B and C, her mother said. Some community advocates are trying to sweep up the pollution. Rocky Morrison leads a cleanup effort along the Merrimack River, which winds through the old milling city of Lowell, and has recovered hundreds of needles in abandoned homeless camps that dot the banks, as well as in piles of debris that collect in floating booms he recently started setting. He has a collection of several hundred needles in a fishbowl, a prop he uses to illustrate that the problem is real and that towns must do more to combat it. “We started seeing it last year here and there. But now, it’s just raining needles everywhere we go,” said Morrison, a burly, tattooed construction worker whose Clean River Project has six boats working parts of the 117-mile (188-kilometer) river. Among the oldest tracking programs is in Santa Cruz, California, where the community group Take Back Santa Cruz has reported finding more than 14,500 needles in the county over the past 4 1/2 years. It says it has gotten reports of 12 people getting stuck, half of them children. “It’s become pretty commonplace to find them. We call it a rite of passage for a child to find their first needle,” said Gabrielle Korte, a member of the group’s needle team. “It’s very depressing. It’s infuriating. It’s just gross.” Some experts say the problem will ease only when more users get treatment and more funding is directed to treatment programs. Others are counting on needle exchange programs, now present in more than 30 states, or the creation of safe spaces to shoot up — already introduced in Canada and proposed by U.S. state and city officials from New York to Seattle. Studies have found that needle exchange programs can reduce pollution, said Don Des Jarlais, a researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai hospital in New York. But Morrison and Korte complain poor supervision at needle exchanges will simply put more syringes in the hands of people who may not dispose of them properly. After complaints of discarded needles, Santa Cruz County took over its exchange from a nonprofit in 2013 and implemented changes. It did away with mobile exchanges and stopped allowing drug users to get needles without turning in an equal number of used ones, said Jason Hoppin, a spokesman for Santa Cruz County. Along the Merrimack, nearly three dozen riverfront towns are debating how to stem the flow of needles. Two regional planning commissions are drafting a request for proposals for a cleanup plan.

 Apr 15, 2017 OSCODA — Representatives from several agencies will be holding a public meeting April 25 in Oscoda to update the public on the perflorinated chemical pollution of drinking water wells in the area, according to a press release from District Health Department No. 2. The event will be held at the Oscoda Methodist Church, located at 120 W. Dwight Avenue, with representatives from DHD No. 2, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and the U.S. Air Force. DHD No. 2 Health Officer Denise Bryan said it has been more than a year since the department issued the initial health advisory to residents. Since that time the scope of pollution has widened and more and more residents are in need of a potable source of drinking water. The meeting will be from 6-8 p.m and cover topics such as sampling results, alternate water supplies, monitoring of the situation and the status of the investigation. From 2-4 p.m., there will be an open house that will allow for one-on-one conversations. DHD No. 2 strongly encourages individuals to attend these events, Bryan said. At this time, the area of concern remains properties between the former Wurtsmith Air Force Base and Van Etten Lake, and properties between Van Etten Lake and Lake Huron, from the US 23/F-41 split north to Chippewa Road. Previously only wells around the base were of concern. Environmental Health Director/Deputy Health Officer Chuck Lichon said it is hard to predict if the pollution, which came from firefighting chemicals used by the Air Force, is spreading. “There is no way to predict at the current time where the plume will extend,” he said “It will extend to Lake Huron, we know that, but you never know where groundwater is going to go.” To help combat the pollution Lichon said the health department has been installing reverse osmosis equipment into homes in the Oscoda area, or installing water bottle coolers, so there is safe drinking water. He said there are more than 300 wells affected so far. He said the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is sinking test wells in areas and taking water samples. Lichon said right now DHD No. 2’s role in the community is to help residents find clean water sources. “Either they are getting the reverse osmosis system — most people are taking that system over the having the water cooler — put in their homes and we work with them,” he said. “We attend meetings and we are kind of a go between with the township and the state, that has been kind of our role in this.” So far Lichon said there have been 65 reverse osmosis systems and 22 water cooler systems installed, with some pending systems to be installed in Oscoda. Lichon said he was unsure what new information would be presented at the meeting, but it was a good way for the public to get refreshed on the situation. “It’s an updating on where things stand, and information that we may have,” he said. “There are seasonal residents too that have not been in the area since last fall, it gives them a chance to ask questions of the state and the Air Force and it kind of gives them a chance for the feedback.” Lichon said one new aspect of the issue is Bryan asking the state for more funding to help replace the filters in the reverse osmosis systems installed a year ago. “The filters are a few hundred dollars,” he said. “We’re hoping to get some reply back on that. That is one issue. The ultimate fix would be to extend the municipal water to these locations.” Jason Ogden can be reached via email at jogden@thealpenanews.com or by phone at 358-5693.

 Dec 27, 2016 HANOVER, N.H. (AP) — Neighbors of Dartmouth College property where for years the Ivy League school disposed of mice and other small animals used in science experiments say they fear pollution from the site has contaminated their groundwater and they worry the school hasn’t been completely up front with them. The site has contaminated the well water of at least one family, that of Richard and Debbie Higgins, who blame a variety of health problems on it, including rashes, hair and skin loss and dizziness. Even their dogs were not spared, they say, with one urinating blood and another vomiting. “We have been drinking the water for years and we had no idea, absolutely no idea,” Debbie Higgins said. Few nearby residents even knew the half-acre plot on the college’s Rennie Farm was used from the 1960s until 1978 to dump carcasses from “tracer experiments,” in which scientists used radioactive compounds to see how things moved through life systems. A nearby site also contained remains of human cadavers and stillborn fetuses used in medical classes. The obscurity of the fenced site changed in 2011, when Dartmouth chose to clean it up, removing 40 tons of carcasses and soil from scores of unlined pits that were legal at the time they were dug. That led to the discovery of hazardous waste and low-level radioactive materials and eventually evidence that at least one chemical used in the animal experiments, the suspected carcinogen 1,4-dioxane, had leaked into the groundwater. It was initially found at 50 times the state standard of 3 parts per billion on the site and more recently as high as 600 parts per billion in the ground. The chemical has been linked to eye, nose and throat irritation and, in long-term exposure, to liver and kidney damage, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The 1,4-dioxane was eventually found to have migrated off the site and contaminated the Higginses’ well across the street, about 800 feet from the site — at twice the state standard. They learned in September 2015 that their well was polluted, and now depend on bottled water supplied by Dartmouth for cooking and drinking. The news has rattled the semi-rural neighborhood, sparking anger and fear among dozens of homeowners who worry the plume will reach their own wells and damage their property values. Many contend Dartmouth was too slow to respond once it found the contamination and has been reluctant to provide full details of what was on the site — something the college denies. “Right now, everyone is very confused and concerned,” said Ellen Waitzkin, a radiologist who lives across from the site. “They are trying to determine on what basis they should feel threatened or not.” The Higginses and other residents argue an alert about the spreading contamination should have gone out earlier. New Hampshire environmental and Dartmouth officials said initial test showed the levels of 1,4-dioxane were declining on the site and were projected to remain on the farm site — though state officials now concede there could have been more aggressive monitoring.

 The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. DETROIT (AP) — An industrial site in Oakland County from where a bright green goo seeped through a concrete barrier onto an area freeway could be foreclosed due to non-payment of property taxes, the county treasurer said Wednesday. Five properties tied to Electro-Plating Services Inc. in Madison Heights owe a total of more than $30,000 in taxes, interest and fees from 2017 and 2018, according to the Oakland County Treasurer's office. The leak was noticed late last year along Interstate 696, about 2 miles north of Detroit's northern city limits. EPA, other officials to brief area residents on toxic Madison Heights site Monday Oakland County identifies seven contaminated sites in need of assessment "The infamous 'green ooze' site ... has all of us on high-alert," Treasurer Andy Meisner said in a release. "I am doing everything within my power as treasurer to hold the owners accountable and to prevent this burden from shifting onto the backs of taxpayers." Michigan property tax law requires that the state be alerted when a site subject to property tax foreclosure "is believed to be contaminated," according to Meisner. Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. Meisner sent a letter Wednesday to Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. If taxes remain unpaid, the property will become tax foreclosed after March 31, Meisner said. State says "green ooze" not impacting drinking water Testing for toxic waste from Madison Heights site expands to Hazel Park Electro-Plating Services was shut down in 2016 for mismanagement of industrial waste. Owner Gary Sayers is serving a year in federal prison for illegally storing hazardous waste. The Associated Press left a message Wednesday seeking comment from Sayers' defense attorney. The leak along the shoulder of I-696 prompted a new investigation that determined high levels of numerous toxins, including hexavalent chromium were in soil and groundwater at the site. Those toxins are associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage.

 A $1 million clean-up along the Bear Creek drain in Warren is nearing completion. (Screen grab from Macomb County Office of Public Works video) A $1 million clean-up along the Bear Creek drain in Warren is nearing completion. (Screen grab from Macomb County Office of Public Works video) A $1 million clean up along the Bear Creek Drain, as a result of a diesel fuel leak from a BP gas station on Mound Road, just north of Interstate 696, is nearing completion, according to the Macomb County Office of Public Works. A press release Monday said the corrective action is expected to be completed in approximately one week. In March 2019, a leak into the drain was discovered. The old fuel was bubbling up into the drain. Immediately, booms and other temporary containment measures were put into place while a longer-term solution was developed. Now, a containment trench has been created that will capture any potential leaks from the gas station, allowing them to be pumped out prior to entering the drain. The containment trench will be checked on a regular basis until it is reported as clean continuously for two years. "Our office discovered this contamination in the drain, and we immediately began to work with the property owner, who has been a great corporate citizen," Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said. "With this action, we have eliminated a source of pollution in one of our drains, which ultimately carries water out to Lake St. Clair. There is no one single action needed to keep our water clean, but many actions, taken together across our region is what makes the difference." "During this work, it was important to us to not only protect the drain, but to work with the owner of this BP station to allow them to remain in operation," Miller said. "It's a very busy truck refueling center along one of our most utilized industrial corridors. We did not want to interrupt the industry in that area. Serving as a component of economic vitality for our residents is our goal, along with keeping our water clean." Work crews are out in the county's open drains -- those that appear as small creeks or rivers -- across the county every day, MCPWO officials said, ensuring proper flow, removing any blockages such as dead trees, and looking for problem spots. MCPWPO has also inspected numerous closed county drains -- massive pipes that travel under major roads around the county. Officials said a new closed drain inspection is scheduled to begin next week on the Lake Boulevard Drain, which runs west-east from Interstate 94 to Lake St. Clair, just north of 12 Mile Road, in Roseville and St. Clair Shores. -- Macomb Daily Online Editor Don Gardner

 Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. A couple hundred Madison Heights area residents applauded several times Monday night as they learned of actions taken since a green ooze on I-696 revealed toxic contamination leaking from the former Electro-Plating Services site on 10 Mile Road. But some still have questions with no quick answers, including about whether the pollution will affect their property values. No contamination in Warren drains from green ooze, mayor says Whitmer considers more criminal charges in 'green ooze' pollution case One of the most surprising facts to come out Monday is that Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has an annual budget of only $15 million and there are 9,000 contaminated sites in southeast Michigan. The cleanup in Madison Heights is expected to cost in “the low millions” of dollars, said Tracy Keoskemeti EGLE, and the agency doesn’t have the money. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter said he was shocked to learn of the low funding level. Money is needed to tear down the three Electro-Plating Services buildings and clean up the site. Madison Heights awaits EPA timeline for cleanup of contaminated site near I-696 David Coulter calls green ooze situation a 'catastrophe' in testimony to lawmakers “I’ve promised the county will help provide the resources to tear down that building,” Coulter said. “We’re not going to let demolition costs be an impediment to the cleanup.” Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. U.S. Rep. Andy Levin said reform laws are needed so that polluters have to pay for their actions. “We have to fully fund EPA to go after corporate polluters,” he said. “We’ve got to do better.” Soil, groundwater and vapor samples thus far have not indicated contamination spreading beyond the site and immediate surroundings, according to the Environmental Protection Agency and EGLE. Testing and test results are continuing, Keoskemeti said. The ooze that spread onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20 did get into the stormwater system and Bear Creek, both of which ultimately reach Lake St. Clair. Oakland County identifies seven contaminated sites in need of assessment Testing for toxic waste from Madison Heights site expands to Hazel Park State says "green ooze" not impacting drinking water However, the contaminants were diluted enough by the time they reached the lake that it is not expected to impact water quality, Keoskemeti said, adding samplings done at seven water plants on the lake and St. Clair River have shown no effect. City, county and state elected officials were on hand at Madison High School as representatives from the EPA, EGLE and the state Department of Health and Human Services updated residents with a briefing and answered written questions. “It was like a chemical hoarding situation,” Keoskemeti said, describing conditions inside the plant where over 5,000 chemical containers, a number of them leaking or degrading, were found inside the facility in 2017 during an initial EPA cleanup and criminal investigation. The site failed to qualify for EPA Superfund status and funding because there was no threat to drinking water and it was estimated there was a low risk of contaminates spreading from the site. The EPA cleanup nearly three years ago was done to remove the immediate hazard, Keoskemeti said, and no soil or groundwater testing was done. The site was then turned over to EGLE. EPA, other officials to brief area residents on toxic Madison Heights site Monday Owner Gary Sayers is serving a one-year federal prison sentence and has to pay $1.5 million for demolition of his three buildings at 945 E. 10 Mile Road. The city is suing him for the costs to tear down the derelict structures on his site in a civil trial that is continuing this week in Oakland County Circuit Court. State Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office and the environmental agencies are looking to see whether there are more actions they can take against Sayers. City and state officials said drinking water is unaffected and there appears to be no soil pollution beyond the former plating company site. “There’s no reason to believe contaminated groundwater has moved to the neighborhoods,” Keoskemeti said. “It’s really localized around that site.” Green liquid that leaked from a pit Sayers had dug beneath the basement was found to include toxins such as hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent, cyanide, trichloroethylene, and PFAS. Two Madison Heights residents – Jennifer Zmarzlik and Amy Lewis – have started a Facebook group called Madison Heights Clean-up, and a website, madisonheightscleanup.eco. They have researched available EPA, EGLE and other public information to inform fellow residents. Zmarzlik credited city officials with successfully pushing for action. She acknowledged being angry when she first learned of the pollution. “I feel as if we are being heard,” she said. “Fear of the unknown can create an atmosphere of negativity. We wanted to give people empowerment” with quick access to information. Three sump pumps run around the clock in the pit of the former plating building, an interceptor trench outside the building, and on the embankment to I-696, said Tricia Edwards of the EPA. More than 63,000 gallons of contaminated water has been pumped into massive frac tanks for disposal. Information on environmental remediation and updates is available online at the EPA’s website at epa.gov/mi/electro-plating-services-i696-release-site, and EGLE’s site at electro-plating services/ I-696 incident.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) FILE - In this Jan. 22, 2020, file photo, President Donald Trump leaves after a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It's been a week packed with rhetoric from President Donald Trump. This, as his Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, played out. An AP Fact Check put his statements under scrutiny and found distortions on a range of topics. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON>> Abroad, at home and in Twitter's ether, President Donald Trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the Davos economic forum played out in Switzerland. On impeachment, the state of the country, abortion, pollution and more, Trump didn't tell the story straight. A week in review: MISSILE ATTACK TRUMP, on U.S. troops targeted by the Iranian missile attack in Iraq this month: "I heard they had headaches and a couple of other things ... and I can report it is not very serious. ... No, I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I've seen. ... No, I do not consider that to be bad injuries, no." — news conference Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland. THE FACTS: That assurance is misleading at best. The Pentagon said Friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to Germany or back to the U.S. for further observation and treatment. Traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life-long debilitation or death. The severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the Pentagon; evaluation of the wounded troops continues. In the first few days after the attacks, Trump inaccurately told the nation that no American service members were hurt. ___ ABORTION TRUMP on Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va.: "The governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth." — remarks at anti-abortion rally Friday. THE FACTS: No, Northam he didn't. Trump routinely twists Northam's words, which were convoluted to begin with. Noting that late-term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive, Northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered. Then, he said, the baby would be "resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue" between doctors and the mother about what to do. In extremely rare instances, babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion. "Execution" is not an option. When a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth, a family may choose what's known as palliative care or comfort care. This might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention. Providing comfort without life-extending treatment is not specific to newborns. It may happen with fatally ill patients of any age. ___ BLUE-COLLAR 'BOOM' TRUMP: "This is a blue-collar boom. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus-47% -- three times faster than the increase for the top 1%." — remarks in Davos on Tuesday. THE FACTS: It isn't a boom for blue-collar workers. They haven't done much better than everyone else, and some of their gains under Trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing. The mining and logging industry, for example, which includes oil and gas workers, lost 21,000 jobs last year. Manufacturers have added just 9,000 jobs in the past six months, while the economy as a whole gained more than 1.1 million jobs during that period. The U.S. economy is still heavily oriented toward services. While factory jobs have grown, other jobs have grown faster, so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since Trump took office. He's right that net worth among the bottom half has risen, but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed. The Federal Reserve says the bottom half has just 1.6% of the nation's wealth, compared with 1.1% when Trump took office. It was 2.1% in 2006. ___ TRUMP: "For the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. We are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: That's not true. Wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few: The richest 1% of Americans own 32% of the nation's wealth, about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated. The middle-class share — defined by the Fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10% — remains at about 29%. This, despite the slight gains of the bottom half. The percentage of Americans who own their own homes, a key source of wealth-building, has improved modestly under Trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013. ___ OCEAN DEBRIS TRUMP: "We have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. ... We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean, where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us, and that's put there by other countries." — Davos news conference Wednesday. THE FACTS: He's right that garbage from abroad has come to U.S. shores by sea. What he does not say is that garbage from the U.S. also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that Americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores. Debris from Asia was most noticeable after the 2011 Japanese tsunami, said marine debris expert Kara Lavender Law of the Sea Education Association, "but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the U.S. and washing ashore in Asia." In fact, she said, most debris is not tracked to the country of origin. The United States produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight, Law said. "Most debris we find on the coast of the U.S. is likely from the U.S.," Denise Hardesty, a scientist who researches ocean trash for Australia's federal science organization, said by email. ___ IMPEACHMENT and UKRAINE TRUMP, on military aid to Ukraine: "Remember this, they got their money and they got it early." — interview Wednesday with Fox Business Network. TRUMP: "They got their money long before schedule." — Davos news conference. THE FACTS: They got the money months late. Congress approved nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in the early months of 2019. U.S. officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that Trump had ordered the assistance to held back, as he pressed Ukraine to announce an investigation of Democrats. It was released Sept. 11, only after a whistleblower's complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine had surfaced and a few days after Democrats in Congress opened the investigation. Previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted. ___ TRUMP, on Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the lead impeachment manager for the Senate trial: "He makes a statement that I made, and it was a total fraud. I never made it. That's why I released the conversation, because if I didn't release it, people would have said that I made the statement that he made. This guy is a fraud." — Fox interview Wednesday. THE FACTS: No, Schiff spoke after Trump released the rough transcript of his July phone call, not before. Trump's claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue. The White House released the account of the conversation on Sept. 25. Schiff gave his account on Sept. 26, while leading a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the matter, as the committee chairman. Trump has made much of Schiff's account, seizing on how the Democrat put words in Trump's mouth in describing the president's conversation with Ukraine's leader. Schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally. He said he was characterizing Trump's conversation "in not so many words," attempting to describe "the essence" of it, and doing something of a "parody." Schiff based his account on the rough transcript. He did not cause it to be released. ___ TRUMP LAWYER JAY SEKULOW, on special counsel Robert Mueller: "We had the invocation of the ghost of the Mueller report. I know something about that report. It came up empty on the issue of collusion with Russia. There was no obstruction, in fact." — impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: He's wrong to suggest that Mueller's report cleared the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia. Nor did the report exonerate Trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice. Instead, the report factually laid out instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, leaving it open for Congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once Trump leaves office. "If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so," Mueller said after the report was released. Mueller's two-year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with Russians. Among them: Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. On collusion, Mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term. He looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front. ___ SEKULOW: "During the proceedings that took place before the Judiciary Committee, the president was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses. The president was denied the right to access evidence. And the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings." — impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's false. The committee, which produced the articles of impeachment, invited Trump or his legal team to come. He declined. Absent White House representation, the hearings proceeded as things in Congress routinely do. Time was split between Democratic and Republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate. Lawyers for Democrats and Republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses, among them an academic called forward by Republicans. The first round of hearings was by the House Intelligence Committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases, conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation. Trump cried foul then at the lack of representation, then rejected representation when the next committee offered it. ___ BLACK COLLEGES TRUMP, on historically black colleges and universities: "I saved HBCUs. We saved them. They were going out and we saved them." — Davos remarks Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's a big stretch. Trump signed a law in December restoring money that lapsed for several months when Congress failed to reauthorize some $255 million in financing on time. The money came back because Senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools. Neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the Trump administration. The administration generally has supported historically black colleges, as previous administrations have done, and it's true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed. The Trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes. But this segment of university education was not vanishing. ___ AIR & WATER TRUMP: "I'm proud to report the United States has among the cleanest air and drinking water on Earth -- and we're going to keep it that way. And we just came out with a report that, at this moment, it's the cleanest it's been in the last 40 years." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, air quality has worsened under his administration. And it's a stretch to say the U.S. is among the countries with the cleanest air. Dozens of nations have less smoggy air. In the U.S. and other countries, air is better than it was during the days of full-on coal power, leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks, before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago. But by multiple measures, air quality has deteriorated in the last few years. Trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean-up of U.S. air and water a half-century ago. As to water quality, one measure, Yale University's global Environmental Performance Index, finds the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water. But after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled. There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, according to an Associated Press analysis of EPA data. And deadly air particle pollution increased 5.5% in the U.S. between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24% from 2009 to 2016, says a Carnegie Mellon University study. The Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days. ___ ECONOMY TRUMP: "We have the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country. And I'm in Europe today because we're bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs -- millions of jobs, in many cases. " — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: His persistent depiction of the U.S. economy as the greatest ever is false. As for jobs pouring into the country, investment by foreign companies has slumped under Trump, according to a report by the Organization for International Investment, a Washington-based association that represents foreign businesses. Foreign companies directly invested $268 billion into the U.S. economy in 2018, a decrease of nearly $220 billion from its record-breaking level in 2016 when Democrat Barack Obama was still president. On the broader picture, economic growth under Trump is not nearly the greatest ever. In the late 1990s, growth topped 4% for four straight years, a level it has not reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth reached 7.2% in 1984. The economy grew 2.9% in 2018 — the same pace it reached in 2015 under Obama — and hasn't hit historically high growth rates. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low of 3.5%, but the proportion of Americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s. Wages were rising at a faster pace back then, too. This much is true: The Obama-Trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. But not the greatest. ___ TRUMP: "The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any U.S. president in recorded history. We started off with a reasonably high rate." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Actually, Trump started with a rate that, if anything, was reasonably low, not "reasonably high." The unemployment rate was 4.7% when Trump replaced Obama in the White House. That is below the long-term U.S. average unemployment of 5.7% since the Labor Department began compiling the data in 1948. Obama inherited a rate of 7.8%. It remained high for years -- topping 8% for a record length of time -- but gradually fell to the below-average level Trump inherited. ___ TRADE TRUMP: "Just last week alone, the United States concluded two extraordinary trade deals — the agreement with China and the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement — the two biggest trade deals ever made." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, there have been larger trade deals. For instance, 123 countries signed the Uruguay Round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the World Trade Organization in 1994. The organization's initial membership accounted for more than 90% of global economic output, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found, and that was before China joined the organization. Also bigger: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have joined North America with Pacific Rim countries in freer trade. Trump took the U.S. out after the deal was negotiated and before the U.S. ratified it. The European Union, with its liberalized trade regimen, was itself formed from a giant deal. The China deal leaves tariffs in place on about $360 billion in imports from China and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations. Trump's U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement is much larger, though it's an update of the long-standing North American Free Trade Agreement worked out by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. ___ HOUSEHOLD INCOME TRUMP: "Real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded." — Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Not really, but it would be misleading even if it were true. Real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of $63,200 first reached in 1999. That's according to adjusted figures the Census Bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time. Trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record. Either way, what the data show is that income for the median household — the one at the exact middle of the income distribution — essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years. The Census data also show that household income fell sharply after the Great Recession, then began rebounding in 2015, before Trump took office.

The road has been shut down after water from the Clinton River Middle Branch partially flooded the roadway. MITCH HOTTS -- THE MACOMB DAILY Heydenreich Road remained closed to traffic Sunday north of Cass Avenue in Clinton Township due to road flooding. MITCH HOTTS -- THE MACOMB DAILY Motorists navigate their way down Heydenreich Road north of Cass Avenue in Clinton Township. The road has been shut down after water from the Clinton River Middle Branch partially flooded the roadway. MITCH HOTTS -- THE MACOMB DAILY After a record-setting rainfall Saturday, two Macomb County wastewater facilities were forced to begin discharging millions of gallons of partially treated sewage into area waterways, according to city, county and state officials. Elsewhere, several roads that were closed for much of the weekend due to flooding from the rain and ice storms are expected to re-open to traffic starting Monday morning as another warming trend is in the forecast. According to the National Weather Service, the area broke a record for the highest single-day rainfall Saturday for the month of January with 2.06 inches of rain recorded at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The previous record was 1.76 inches on Jan. 12, 1908, said National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin Kacan. There was a chance overnight and into Monday morning for freezing drizzle, but Kacan said: "But compared to the event we had (Saturday), we are going to be quite a bit quieter around here." The heavy rains resulted in two sewage discharges in an effort to prevent basement flooding. The Chapaton retention basin, located on Lake St. Clair in St. Clair Shores, dumped in excess of 60 million gallons of combined sewer overflow, according to the Macomb County Public Works Office. Also, the Warren sewage treatment plant, which lies near 14 Mile and Van Dyke, adjacent to Bear Creek, sent an as-of-yet-uknown number of gallons of sewage-tainted water into the Red Run Drain. That water ultimately empties into the lake. Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller on Sunday said the 60 million gallons could have been reduced in half if her office could convince the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) to issue permits for an expansion project. Miller said upgrade plans would not have prevented a discharge due to the intense rainfall, the pending plans would allow the county to contain most average rain events. "It is beyond infuriating that the agency assigned to be the environmental watchdog in our state is holding up our permits," Miller said in a news release. "Another 60 million gallons of combined sewer overflow into the lake? That is not, cannon and will not be the right answer." State EGLE officials have said the Chapaton facility is providing "adequate" combined sewer treatment to the water quality under its existing National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Miller claims the permits are based on outdated standards. In Eastpointe and St. Clair Shores, underground sewer systems are designed to carry both sanitary sewage and storm water flow. During heavy rain events, the system becomes overwhelmed, according to the public works office. The Chapaton basin allows county operators to hold up to 30 million gallons of excess water, but once that limit is reached, it is treated with a heavy bleach solution and discharged into Lake St. Clair. The county public works office's proposed expansion would increase that capacity to about 60 million gallons. In a news release Sunday, St. Clair Shores Mayor Kip Walby said the state's refusal to issue the new permit "boggles the mind." "Under Commissioner Miller's leadership, we finally have a creative, cost effective solution that would reduce CSOs at Chapaton by about 70%, but our state environmental agency is throwing up roadblocks," St. Clair Shores Mayor Kip Walby said in a news release. The Warren sewage treatment plant began discharging about 10 p.m. Saturday, according to a report by Bryan Clor of the waste water division. As of Sunday evening, the discharging apparently was still underway. The discharge was triggered after 2.76 inches of rainfall. The sewage, which was skimmed and treated with disinfectant prior to being discharged, was emptied into the Red Run Drain, which feeds into the Clinton River and ultimately into Lake St. Clair. Communities are required by law to report overflows to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy within 48 hours, with a more detailed report to follow. Meanwhile, most Macomb County communities on Sunday dealt with ice-covered sidewalks and parking lots following Saturday's storm but traffic was generally moving at posted speeds due to thawing conditions and salted roads by crews of the Macomb County Department of Roads. The road department had about 50 trucks salting area roads late Saturday and into Sunday, according to a spokesman. Some roads remained closed due to flooded conditions, according to the roads department. Those include 24 Mile between North Avenue and Card Road; Heydenreich between Cass Avenue and Dunham; Shook Road right lane south of Jefferson Avenue; 21 Mile between Romeo Plank Road and Heydenreich; Andrews Road between Meskill Road and Logg Road; Dayton between Burman Road and Omo Road; and 27 Mile between Indian Trail Road and North Avenue The National Weather Service said a flood warning remains in effect for the North Branch of the Clinton River until further notice. At 10 a.m. Sunday, the river stage is 14.3 feet and rising. The flood stage is 15 feet. Weather forecasters say the river will rise above flood stage by late this afternoon, cresting at about 15.5 feet after midnight. The waterway is expected to start receding until Monday. Intermittent sunshine helped melt ice on the roadways, creating mostly slushy conditions on Sunday. The weather forecast calls for a high near 40 degrees Monday, falling to an overnight low of 31. Look for mostly cloudy conditions Tuesday, with a high near 46. No significant precipitation is expected until the end of the week, according to the weather service.

CITY OF STERLING HEIGHTS PHOTO Booms are placed in the Red Run Drain in Sterling Heights to prevent further distribution of suspected leaked gasoline. MACOMB COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS PHOTO The source of a 75-100 gallon petroleum spill or leak into a Warren drain remained a mystery Saturday despite investigative efforts, Macomb County officials said. The spill was discovered Friday morning in the Clinton River and traced to the underground Schoenherr Relief Drain in Warren, which was dumping the substance into the open-air Red Run Drain at their intersection just north of 14 Mile Road in Sterling Heights. Absorbent booms were placed to collect the petroleum. Public Works investigators began their work Friday and made several manned entries into the underground drain in Warren on Saturday, according to officials from Macomb County Public Works. They will continue to investigate in the hopes of determining the source. The booms will remain in place until the water "runs clear" of any petroleum, officials said in a news release. Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said in the release the incident shows how it can affect water flowing into Lake St. Clair miles away. "Here's a spill that happened in Warren and was seen in the river some five or 10 miles away on the way out to Lake St. Clair,” Miller said. Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller.

I also appreciate the work of the staffs at Clinton Township, Warren and Sterling Heights, who assisted with this response.

 The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has collected about 11,000 gallons of contaminated water from the site of a condemned plating company near I-696 in Madison Heights. Groundwater and soil samples were taken Friday from the Electro-Plating Services property on 10 Mile Road. Two weeks ago a toxic green substance seeped from site onto the freeway, alarming people throughout the region and state. The EPA reported that two sump wells installed just before Christmas have collected almost 11,000 gallons of contaminated groundwater from beneath the facility and on the highway embankment where the contamination was discovered on Dec. 20. Most of the contaminated water collected has come from a pit Electro-Plating’s owner dug in the basement to illegally store hazardous materials. Madison Heights has been dealing with the issue through the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) and the EPA. Twenty-five wells for testing were drilled on and near the site. Test results will help analysts evaluate the contamination. That work will help investigators find the extent and levels of contamination and seek a more permanent solution to protect the environment and human health, according to a news release from EGLE. Test results are expected within a week or two. More testing and investigation are likely to be based on the results of the initial analyses. EGLE on Thursday sampled water at the point where the affected sewer system surfaces at Bear Creek to determine levels of contaminants entering the creek. That water eventually flows into the Clinton River and then Lake St. Clair. Officials said those results from those sample should be available late next week. Chemicals tested for include hexavalent chromium and other heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and cyanide. Though no nearby homes or business use well water and are on the Great Lakes Water Authority system, EGLE is to test drinking water as a precaution. EGLE Director Liesl Clark said the Electro-Plating site is one of thousands of contaminated sites that need to be more fully addressed and that a formal review of EGLE’s pollution inspection procedures is underway, as requested by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. “This situation highlights a long-term challenge that we must meet,” said Clark said in a statement. “Thousands of contaminated properties exist in Michigan, many having languished for decades without appropriate assessment or cleanup. That’s unacceptable in a state surrounded by almost 20 percent of the world’s fresh surface water.” She said contaminated sites have to be cleaned up sooner. “We will start 2020 by analyzing how best to accomplish this,” Clark said. “I look forward to working with EGLE, local communities, our federal partners, and our Michigan Legislature to put measures in place to aggressively attack these problems.” The heavy green toxic liquid in Madison Heights first showed up outside the condemned site on the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. Gary Sayers, owner of the company that caused the contamination, was sentenced in November to a year in prison and to pay $1.5 million to the EPA to cover the agency’s emergency cleanup of the site a couple of years ago. Sayers over decades failed to comply with orders to legally dispose of toxic waste at the plant, illegally storing it inside thousands of containers. Over time many of them corroded and leaked.

Macomb Daily file photo In this 2015 file photo, a pipe carrying PCB-tainted oil that is being sucked out of a manhole vault on Bon Brae Street is shown. Macomb Daily file photo WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has built up the biggest backlog of unfunded toxic Superfund clean-up projects in at least 15 years, nearly triple the number that were stalled for lack of money in the Obama era, according to 2019 figures quietly released by the Environmental Protection Agency over the winter holidays. The accumulation of Superfund projects that are ready to go except for money comes as the Trump administration routinely proposes funding cuts for Superfund and for the EPA in general. The four-decade-old Superfund program is meant to tackle some of the most heavily contaminated sites in the U.S. and Trump has declared it a priority even while seeking to shrink its budget. "There hasn't been a sense of urgency," said Violet Donoghue, who has lived for 31 years on Bon Brae Street in St. Clair Shores. Toxic PCBs have poisoned some local soil, water and fish at nearby Lake St. Clair, and the neighborhood is one of the 34 Superfund sites where clean-up projects languished for lack of money in 2019. "I feel many people have been harmed, but that's only my opinion," Donoghue said. She said the last word from the EPA was that soil would be removed from the front of her house. "Now when they say they're cleaning it, I say, 'OK, give me the date,'" she said. The unfunded projects are in 17 states and Puerto Rico. They range from abandoned mines that discharged heavy metals and arsenic in the West to an old wood pulp site in Mississippi and a defunct dry cleaner that released toxic solvents in North Carolina. Congress created the Superfund program in 1980 after the Love Canal episode and other notorious pollution cases. Its intent is to hold polluters responsible for cleanup costs or provide taxpayer money when no responsible party can be identified. Trump "is focused on putting Americans first," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told a Senate environment committee early 2019. "There may be no better example than our success in the Superfund program." "We are in the process of cleaning up some of the nation's largest, most complex sites and returning them to productive use," Wheeler said then. But two former EPA officials whose work dealt with Superfund oversight said the growing backlog of stalled Superfund projects under the Trump administration, and steady or ebbing numbers of clean-up construction projects completed, point to a different picture. "They're misleading Congress and the public about the funds that are needed to really protect the public from exposure to the toxic chemicals," said Elizabeth Southerland, who worked for 30 years at EPA, including as director of science and technology in the water office, before retiring in 2017. ''It's detrimental." This is a "regulatory failure," said Judith Enck, who served as the EPA's regional northeastern U.S. administrator under President Barack Obama. Given the growing numbers of unfunded clean-up projects, "EPA should be knocking on the door of Congress and saying, give us more money to deal with the sites,'' Enck said. Asked what the EPA spent money on instead, and why the agency didn't ask Congress for more to deal with the growing backlog, EPA spokeswoman Maggie Sauerhage offered few specifics Thursday. The EPA's Superfund program "will continue to prioritize new construction projects based on which sites present the greatest risk to human health and the environment," Sauerhage said in an email. "Further, the agency maintains the authority to respond to and fund emergencies at these sites if there is an imminent threat to human health and the environment." She pointed to some areas where Trump's Superfund effort was more on par with that of his predecessors. Long-term remedial efforts to make sure contamination didn't rebound at existing Superfund sites, for example, averaged 64 a year under Trump. That compares with an average of 60 a year in Obama's last five years. But overall, the backlog of 34 unfunded projects is up from only 12 in 2016, Obama's last year. At the site of another of 2019's unfunded Superfund projects, Montana's Upper Tenmile mining region, which includes the community of Rimini and a subdivision downstream, the EPA has been providing bottled water to residents for the past decade in response to water supplies polluted by about 150 abandoned gold, lead and copper mines. Pollution still flows from the mines and into Upper Tenmile Creek more than 20 years after the area was added to the Superfund list. About 6 miles from Rimini in the rural Landmark subdivision is a huge pile of contaminated soil that was removed from residential yards. It was supposed to be hauled away but now has weeds growing over it after sitting untouched for several years, said Patrick Keim, who lives nearby. "It's a sword of Damocles hanging over us," Keim said. "It just seems counterproductive they would spend two or three million dollars re-mediating this piece of property, haul it off and stockpile it across the road and then run out of money and leave this big pile for everybody to look at." Montana environmental regulators also are involved in the cleanup but say they need the EPA to come through with money for the work to resume, since the federal agency is providing 90 percent of funding. Under Trump, the EPA has pointed to a different yardstick in declaring it was making progress on Superfund clean-ups — the number of cleaned-up sites officially deleted from the roster of more than 1,300 Superfund sites. In 2019, for instance, the EPA said it had deleted all or part of 27 sites from the official Superfund list, saying that was the most deletions since the George W. Bush administration. But deletions from the list typically reflect clean-up work done over decades and often completed on the ground years ago, meaning Trump is sometimes taking credit for work done under his predecessors. In 2018, for example, the EPA cited the seven Superfund sites fully or partially removed from the list in the previous year as a signature accomplishment of the Trump administration. Records showed the physical work was completed before Trump took office, The Associated Press reported at the time. Sauerhage, the EPA spokeswoman, did not directly respond to questions about the backlog of 34 unfunded Superfund clean-up projects. The EPA posted the total on its website without fanfare the day after Christmas. Some of the projects that are ready to start have languished for lack of money since Trump's first year in office. EPA has been one of the main focuses of Trump's efforts to cut federal regulations and oversight that he sees as burdening businesses. Trump each year has asked Congress for nearly one-third cuts in EPA's budget, and has sought much smaller cuts for Superfund. Congress has kept both levels of funding roughly even. ___ White contributed from St. Clair Shores, Michigan, and Brown from Billings, Montana.

 As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA work to clean up chemicals leaching onto the eastbound lanes in Madison Heights. DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA work to clean up chemicals leaching onto the eastbound lanes in Madison Heights. DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY Storm drains in Warren connected to Interstate 696 are not contaminated with a hazardous chemical related to the green substance which oozed from the embankment on the eastbound side of the freeway in neighboring Madison Heights, officials said. Warren Mayor Jim Fouts said inspectors assigned to the industrial pre-treatment program at the Warren Waste Water Treatment Plant checked all storm drains that potentially could have been contaminated with the green goo, and found no pollution from the spill. "Great news," Fouts said. "I emphasize they checked all drains in Warren connected to 696 and found no contamination. We also closely monitor four businesses that use hexavalent." Tests on the so-called green ooze showed levels of hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium 6, a cancer-causing chemical. It is used in industry for the chrome plating on vehicles. On Monday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced her administration is looking into additional criminal charges against the operators of the abandoned Electro-Plating Services, the industrial company in Madison Heights linked to the green ooze and chemicals leaking from the site and onto the freeway, between Dequindre Road and John R. "The ongoing situation in Madison Heights is very concerning, and further stresses the need to enforce protections that keep Michiganders safe," said Whitmer, noting that she also wants to toughen pollution inspection and enforcement efforts. She said the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has been ordered to review how the agency inspects industrial discharges. "My administration is actively reviewing all means of accountability, including further criminal charges against the polluter who caused this mess. Today I also directed EGLE to conduct a formal review of its pollution inspection procedures to strengthen enforcement and accountability," the governor said in a prepared statement. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel echoed support of Whitmer's actions, saying her office would do "everything in our power" to assist the governor's office. She also announced the formation of a new criminal unit for environmental cases. "I have recently added new resources to our Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division and am creating a Criminal Unit that will focus specifically on environmental prosecutions," she said. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led crews have been working to prevent further leaks after a flow of a green liquid substance was observed spilling through an embankment wall onto the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. They are trying to determine how much of the chemical may have leached through into groundwater, which eventually would reach Lake St. Clair. Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said Tuesday the results of testing by Warren officials is indeed good news, providing a degree of relief. “I feel very good. I certainly applaud the efforts of Mayor Fouts and his team and being extremely pro-active and doing the testing they did,” Miller said. “I think the citizens of Warren can feel a high degree of confidence that in Macomb County we take these things seriously.” Miller isn’t breathing a complete sigh of relief, however. She said the threat to waterways and Lake St. Clair continues because of chemicals that leached onto the surface and into soil. Noting the green ooze, Miller said she is troubled that EGLE told the EPA as late as last spring that chemicals weren’t migrating. “When in fact it was,” Miller said. The Macomb County public works boss believes the embankment along I-696 in the area of the ooze potentially would have to be excavated. Miller said environmental engineers from her department will continue to be on site at Electro-Plating Services as work there continues. “We are going to partner with EGLE and EPA to understand what their plan is,” she added. On Sunday, Miller expressed concern that both EGLE and the EPA "did not adequately follow through" in initial cleanup measures. She feels the property requires long-term remediation and wants to see it demolished. State officials three years ago ordered Electro-Plating Services to close after discovering hundreds of corroded drums and vats of hazardous waste on the site. The property underwent a $1.5 million environmental partial cleanup in 2017 after it was named a Superfund site. The company's owner, Gary Sayers of Bloomfield Township, pleaded guilty in February in federal court to illegal storage of hazardous waste and sentenced to serve one year in prison. He is expected to surrender to authorities in the first quarter of 2020. Sayers also was ordered to pay $1.5 million restitution. Hugh McDiarmid Jr., a spokesman for EGLE, said Monday the department is working with federal and local officials to review decades of decision-making and testing at the site. It's not known how long the fact gathering will take. "It is important to note that significant cleanup and enforcement actions have taken place over the last three years, including property condemnation, a cease-and-desist order that stopped the polluting process, a criminal conviction, and a $1.5 million-$2 million federal emergency cleanup of thousands of drums of waste and contaminated liquid," McDiarmid said in an email.

MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO According to the EPA, the agency has dispatched personnel to respond to the site to remove contamination that is migrating off the property. Those actions include: • Removing contaminated water that had leaked onto I-696 and into the catch basins of the sewer system. • Installing two sumps. The first, in the basement pit of the Electro-Plating Services building, to collect and remove water from the basement into a portable tank to prevent water from migrating off-site. The second, a collection system along the embankment wall of I-696 which has been plumbed to discharge into a frac-tank that has been placed on the shoulder of the highway. Both sumps are operational 24 hours a day. • Collecting more than 7,000 gallons of liquid from storm drains, the on-site monitoring well and the basement of the former plating facility. • Beginning an expanded assessment to determine what further actions may be necessary, including drilling test wells to evaluate how far contamination has migrated through area soil. Madison Heights officials are seeking a court order to have Sayers demolish the abandoned building. A trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 13 in Oakland County Circuit Court. Fouts noted that many industries are starting to switch to a fake paint which gives the same appearance as the use of hexavalent chromium. “The state of Michigan should mandate that hexavalent be discontinued and the use of fake paint be used as a replacement,” the mayor said. “I'm also very impressed with the effort and expertise that Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller has demonstrated in her effort to protect Macomb County from this highly toxic ooze in Oakland County.” Fouts also commended Warren Waste Treatment Director Bryan Clor for his effort to get the inspections of the storm drains started.

DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY Corroded and leaking containers with a copper cyanide label in the basement of Electro Plating. PHOTO -- MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday said her administration is looking into additional criminal charges against the operators of an abandoned Oakland County industrial company that has become known as the "green ooze" polluter due to leaking chemicals from the site. The governor issued a statement on the controversy surrounding the closed Electro-Plating Services, which has become notorious for leaking a greenish-colored chemical onto Interstate 696 in Madison Heights. She also wants to toughen pollution inspection and enforcement efforts. "The ongoing situation in Madison Heights is very concerning, and further stresses the need to enforce protections that keep Michiganders safe," Whitmer said. She added the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has been ordered to review how the agency inspects industrial dischargers. "My administration is actively reviewing all means of accountability, including further criminal charges against the polluter who caused this mess. Today I also directed EGLE to conduct a formal review of its pollution inspection procedures to strengthen enforcement and accountability," the governor said in the statement. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel echoed support of Whitmer's actions, saying her office would do "everything in our power" to assist the governor's office. She also announced the formation of a new criminal unit for environmental cases. "I have recently added new resources to our Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division and am creating a Criminal Unit that will focus specifically on environmental prosecutions," she said in the statement. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led crews have been working to prevent further leaks after a flow of a green liquid substance was observed spilling through an embankment wall onto the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. They are trying to determine how much of the chemical may have leached through into groundwater, which eventually will end up in Lake St. Clair. State officials ordered the business to close three years ago after discovering hundreds of corroded drums and vats of hazardous waste on the site. Tests on the so-called green ooze showed levels of hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium 6, a cancer-causing chemical. Electro-Plating Services underwent a $1.5 million environmental partial cleanup in 2017 after it was named a Superfund site. The company's owner, Gary Sayers, pleaded guilty in February in federal court to illegal storage of hazardous waste and sentenced to serve one year in prison. He is expected to surrender to authorities in the first quarter of 2020. Sayers was also ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution. Sterling Heights-based attorney James Thomas, who represented the Bloomfield Township man during the criminal trial, could not be reached Monday. On Sunday, Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller expressed concern that both EGLE and the EPA "did not adequately follow through" in initial cleanup measures. She feels the property requires long-term remediation and wants to see it demolished. Hugh McDiarmid Jr., a spokesman for EGLE, on Monday said the department is working with federal and local officials to review decades of decision-making and testing at the site. It's not known how long the fact-gathering will take. "It is important to note that significant cleanup and enforcement actions have taken place over the last three years, including property condemnation, a cease-and-desist order that stopped the polluting process, a criminal conviction, and a $1.5 million-$2 million federal emergency cleanup of thousands of drums of waste and contaminated liquid," McDiarmid said in an email. According to the EPA, the agency has dispatched personnel to respond to the site to remove contamination that is migrating off the property. Those actions include: • Removing contaminated water that had leaked onto I-696 and into the catch basins of the sewer system • Installing two sumps. The first, in the basement pit of the Electro-Plating Services building, to collect and remove water from the basement into a portable tank to prevent water from migrating off-site.

This assessment includes drilling test wells to evaluate how far contamination has migrated through area soil. Meanwhile, a civil trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 13 as Madison Heights seeks an order to have Sayers tear down the building. The trial is before Oakland County Circuit Judge Hala Jarbou.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PHOTO The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO Erin Brockovich PHOTO FROM FACEBOOK Preliminary test results of soil and groundwater at and near the site of the “green ooze” on Interstate 696 show no risk to drinking water but high levels of multiple contaminants. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in a news release late Friday afternoon that complete data from the testing will be available after a quality control review is complete next week. Test of water in the storm sewers near the site showed levels of hexavalent chromium at 0.14 milligrams per liter. The standard for drinking water is 0.10 mg/L. Officials had previously indicated that chemical was found. The EGLE said drinking water intakes in Lake St. Clair have not been impacted. “The storm sewer eventually enters Lake St. Clair miles away,” EGLE said. “At that point, concentrations would be well below detectable levels although still a significant concern for incremental accumulation in the ecosystem.” The green liquid substance was found last Friday spilling onto the eastbound side of the freeway between John R and Dequindre roads in Madison Heights through an embankment wall. Officials learned it came from a nearby business, Electro-Plating Services on 10 Mile Road, that was shut down by the state three years ago "after inspectors discovered hundreds of corroded drums, vats and other containers of hazardous waste at the site," according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It was partially cleaned up by the EPA. Clean-up efforts at the site, near the Warren border, have begun. The EPA-conducted tests also showed high levels of contaminants in the groundwater between the building and the I-696 service drive, including chromium, trichloroethylene and cyanide – all chemicals previously used in the EPS facility, EGLE said. "Since 1967, the company used copper, tin, bronze, cadmium, nickel, chrome, gold, silver, zinc and lead for various electroplating operations, resulting in the contamination," the EPA said in 2017. Soil tests on the embankment where the green liquid appeared on the shoulder also showed hexavalent chromium, as well as multiple heavy metals and other contaminants at levels below the threshold for direct human contact, EGLE said Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller earlier Friday called the leak “life-threatening and terrifying.” Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller speaks at her office. MACOMB DAILY FILE PHOTO “The toxic waste coming from this business site in Madison Heights is life-threatening and terrifying,” Miller said in a prepared statement. “The current conditions in that business – conditions after a $1.5 million EPA-led cleanup – tells me that guidelines on how such cleanups are conducted are inadequate. The bare minimum was done on this clean up. This situation requires both immediate and long-term remediation. The building should be demolished and the surrounding soils tested and excavated. A strong advocate for clean water, Miller said the discovery “may have been a blessing in disguise as it led to the revelation of an incredibly dangerous situation at this abandoned business.” “This incident has shown that deadly chemicals from this site can leach out and have the potential of making their way all the way to Lake St. Clair and thereby entering our drinking water supply.” The incident has gained national attention. Hexavalent chromium is the same chemical found in groundwater in California that led Erin Brokovich to help a campaign building a case against the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in 1993 that inspired the 2000 movie, “Erin Brockovich." Brockovich posted about it Monday on her Facebook page. “Nothing like being thought of around the holiday season for 'Green Ooze,' Brockovich wrote. “We will be following up to insure the chromium doesn't contaminate any surface water bodies ... and that the ground water and soils are indeed thoroughly cleaned up.” The chemical is a carcinogen, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It is used in the industrial process to increase hardening-ability and corrosion resistance of steel. EPS and its owner, Gary Sayers, were charged with illegal operation of a hazardous waste facility by U.S. Attorneys. Sayers was sentenced in November in U.S. District Court in Detroit to one year and one day in prison. He is to begin serving early next year. The location was declared a Superfund site by the EPA. Since the spill, the grassy slope and shoulder have been fenced off, and the Couzens Road exit lane and a right lane have been closed and will remain closed indefinitely, said Diane Cross of the Michigan Department of Transportation. “There is no timetable (for the closures),” she said. “It will definitely go into January.” A pit in the basement of Electro-Plating Services in Madison Heights in December 2017. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PHOTO EGLE said the EPA conducted a cleanup of the site in 2017. It removed hazardous chemicals and pumping contaminated liquid from an earthen pit in the basement of the facility. “This clean-up addressed the immediate hazards on the site but was not intended to address all environmental impacts,” EGLE said. EGLE said that late next week the EPA will begin dozens of soil borings to help determine the extent and levels of contamination. Regulators continue to work on the site daily, including the following activities, according to EGLE: * Daily vacuuming of nearby catch basins. * Maintenance and inspection of sump pumps collecting contaminated water from both inside the facility and on the highway embankment. * Daily monitoring of air in the building using hand-held monitors. * Preparing for the impact of rain and freezing weather. EGLE said that gravel that partially filled a “basement pit at EPS following the EPA clean-up ... was saturated with green water and there was 2-3 inches of frozen water on top of the gravel. “A sump was dug into the gravel and a float-operated pump was installed. The water is being pumped into a 20,000-gallon portable tank on site,” EGLE said. “EPA contractors will continue to remove water from the basement at EPS while a long-term remedy is developed.” To report environmental emergencies, contact the Pollution Emergency Alerting System hotline 1-800-292-4706. EGLE will post updates at Electroplating Services / I-696 Incident. @JamesonCook on Twitter Jameson Cook is a multimedia journalist at The Macomb Daily.

STATE OF MICHIGAN PHOTO @JamesonCook on Twitter The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. FILE PHOTO A green liquid that leaked on to Interstate 696 in Madison Heights came from a company whose owner was recently sentenced to one year in prison for illegally operating a hazardous material facility. The liquid was found Friday afternoon oozing on to the eastbound side of the freeway near Couzens Road near the Warren border. It was determined the substance, which contained Hexavalent chromium, originated from Electro-Plating Services, 945 E. 10 Mile Road, which was shut down three years ago by what was known then as the state Department of Environmental Quality. It was later declared a Superfund site by the federal Environmental Protection Agency for illegal storage of hazardous material. The company and its owner, Gary Alfred Sayers, were charged with a crime and sentenced Nov. 5 to one year in prison in U.S. District Court in Detroit. Sayers and the company were ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution for the cost of the clean-up, which was completed in January 2018. Materials included cyanide, chromium, chloride and various acids as part of its plating process, and were stored in drums, containers and a pit dug in the ground. In the recent incident, the Michigan Department of Transportation reported a green liquid substance leaking from a retaining wall along the embankment. A liquid substance leaks on to Interstate 696 on Friday in Madison Heights. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO A HAZMAT team and local, state and federal officials responded and stopped the leak and have been conducting a clean-up and containment. Hexavalent chromium is a carcinogen that is harmful if inhaled or exposed to unprotected skin. The Couzens exit lane and ramp and the right thru-lane were closed and will remain closed until at least Friday while officials await the results of test samples to determine if other substances were also present. Jill Greenberg, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, said Monday that HAZMAT workers vacuumed storm sewers and catch basins in the area and placed a sump-pump in the business’ basement to prevent groundwater from spreading. A fence was erected on the embankment to prevent anyone from entering the contaminated area, she added. Greenberg said there has been no evidence that anyone has come into contact with the substance or that any drinking water was impacted. “There’s no imminent danger to drinking water,” she said. Some of the substance may have migrated from the area into a nearby drain and eventually into Lake St. Clair but that has not been determined. She said officials will decide the next phase of operation after the test results are learned Friday. A clean-up could involve removing the embankment in the area. State Rep. Lori Stone, D-Warren, vowed Monday to "remain vigilant" in monitoring and correcting the situation.

STATE OF MICHIGAN PHOTO “I am alarmed by the threat (Hexavalent chromium) poses for soil, groundwater and watershed contamination, putting the health and safety of our families at risk," she said. State Sen. Jeremy Moss, D-Southfield, and state Rep. Jim Ellison, D-Royal Oak, added in a joint statement: “Preventable situations such as this are why we must act with urgency to enforce stronger policies to hold polluters accountable and protect our residents." Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice S. Miller commended the quick response but said the incident points out the need for a coordinated monitoring plan to protect Great Lakes water quality. “Michigan EGLE and EPA were quickly on the job and engaged in this clean up on what was essentially a holiday weekend,” Miller said in a written statement. “This issue points out the need to monitor and have a means to capture the storm water off our major freeways – which amounts to millions of gallons of water per year directly entering into Lake St. Clair and the Great Lake system.” Whether Electro-Plating Services and the owner will face other sanctions has not been determined. Miller said her agency is “concerned” that the groundwater around the business was not tested, in light of the $1.5 million clean-up. “We cannot continue to operate the way that we have in the past," she said. "The Great Lakes are a world treasure, and we must work together to serve as their guardians. A single drop of this chromium 6 contamination that might enter the lake is one drop too much." Miller noted that this year Macomb County Public Works has responded to several instances of oil sheens, cement run-off and old paint entering into the county drains. MCPWO operates a 24-hour spill response emergency number, (877) 679-4337. Those who see an emergency situation may also call 911. @JamesonCook on Twitter Jameson Cook is a multimedia journalist at The Macomb Daily.

 Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. Over 100 people turned out for a briefing at Madison Heights High School from EPA and state EGLE environmental agency officials on testing efforts at a former plating company on 10 Mile Road caused a green toxic ooze to leak onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20. A couple hundred Madison Heights area residents applauded several times Monday night as they learned of actions taken since a green ooze on I-696 revealed toxic contamination leaking from the former Electro-Plating Services site on 10 Mile Road. But some still have questions with no quick answers, including about whether the pollution will affect their property values. No contamination in Warren drains from green ooze, mayor says Whitmer considers more criminal charges in 'green ooze' pollution case One of the most surprising facts to come out Monday is that Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has an annual budget of only $15 million and there are 9,000 contaminated sites in southeast Michigan. The cleanup in Madison Heights is expected to cost in the low millions of dollars, said Tracy Keoskemeti EGLE, and the agency doesnt have the money. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter said he was shocked to learn of the low funding level. Money is needed to tear down the three Electro-Plating Services buildings and clean up the site. Madison Heights awaits EPA timeline for cleanup of contaminated site near I-696 David Coulter calls green ooze situation a 'catastrophe' in testimony to lawmakers Ive promised the county will help provide the resources to tear down that building, Coulter said. Were not going to let demolition costs be an impediment to the cleanup. Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter speaking at Madison Heights High School on Monday. Coulter said the county will cover the cost of demolishing a former plating company building that caused pollutants to get into the ground water around the site near I-696. U.S. Rep. Andy Levin said reform laws are needed so that polluters have to pay for their actions. We have to fully fund EPA to go after corporate polluters, he said. Weve got to do better. Soil, groundwater and vapor samples thus far have not indicated contamination spreading beyond the site and immediate surroundings, according to the Environmental Protection Agency and EGLE. Testing and test results are continuing, Keoskemeti said. The ooze that spread onto the shoulder of I-696 on Dec. 20 did get into the stormwater system and Bear Creek, both of which ultimately reach Lake St. Clair. Oakland County identifies seven contaminated sites in need of assessment Testing for toxic waste from Madison Heights site expands to Hazel Park State says "green ooze" not impacting drinking water However, the contaminants were diluted enough by the time they reached the lake that it is not expected to impact water quality, Keoskemeti said, adding samplings done at seven water plants on the lake and St. Clair River have shown no effect. City, county and state elected officials were on hand at Madison High School as representatives from the EPA, EGLE and the state Department of Health and Human Services updated residents with a briefing and answered written questions. It was like a chemical hoarding situation, Keoskemeti said, describing conditions inside the plant where over 5,000 chemical containers, a number of them leaking or degrading, were found inside the facility in 2017 during an initial EPA cleanup and criminal investigation. The site failed to qualify for EPA Superfund status and funding because there was no threat to drinking water and it was estimated there was a low risk of contaminates spreading from the site. The EPA cleanup nearly three years ago was done to remove the immediate hazard, Keoskemeti said, and no soil or groundwater testing was done. The site was then turned over to EGLE. EPA, other officials to brief area residents on toxic Madison Heights site Monday Owner Gary Sayers is serving a one-year federal prison sentence and has to pay $1.5 million for demolition of his three buildings at 945 E. 10 Mile Road. The city is suing him for the costs to tear down the derelict structures on his site in a civil trial that is continuing this week in Oakland County Circuit Court. State Attorney General Dana Nessels office and the environmental agencies are looking to see whether there are more actions they can take against Sayers. City and state officials said drinking water is unaffected and there appears to be no soil pollution beyond the former plating company site. Theres no reason to believe contaminated groundwater has moved to the neighborhoods, Keoskemeti said. Its really localized around that site. Green liquid that leaked from a pit Sayers had dug beneath the basement was found to include toxins such as hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent, cyanide, trichloroethylene, and PFAS. Two Madison Heights residents  Jennifer Zmarzlik and Amy Lewis  have started a Facebook group called Madison Heights Clean-up, and a website, madisonheightscleanup.eco. They have researched available EPA, EGLE and other public information to inform fellow residents. Zmarzlik credited city officials with successfully pushing for action. She acknowledged being angry when she first learned of the pollution. I feel as if we are being heard, she said. Fear of the unknown can create an atmosphere of negativity. We wanted to give people empowerment with quick access to information. Three sump pumps run around the clock in the pit of the former plating building, an interceptor trench outside the building, and on the embankment to I-696, said Tricia Edwards of the EPA. More than 63,000 gallons of contaminated water has been pumped into massive frac tanks for disposal. Information on environmental remediation and updates is available online at the EPAs website at epa.gov/mi/electro-plating-services-i696-release-site, and EGLEs site at electro-plating services/ I-696 incident.

 As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA worked to clean up chemicals that leaked from a former Electro-Plating Service building onto the eastbound shoulder in Madison Heights several days before Christmas. The cleanup work and analysis continues and EPA and state EGLE officials are updating area residents at a public meeting Monday. As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA worked to clean up chemicals that leaked from a former Electro-Plating Service building onto the eastbound shoulder in Madison Heights several days before Christmas. The cleanup work and analysis continues and EPA and state EGLE officials are updating area residents at a public meeting Monday. Experts from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy are set to meet with Madison Heights area residents to answer questions about the contaminated Electro-Plating Services site. The meeting is at 6 p.m. Monday at the Madison Heights High School, 915 E. 11 Mile Road. State Rep. Jim Ellison and other city, county, state and national officials, including U.S Rep. Andy Levin, said they are attending the meeting. People from the EPA and EGLE are going to update the community on what theyve found at the site and how long its going to take to clean it up, Ellison said. There are a lot of fingers being pointed now, which is counterproductive. Well have plenty of time to find the cause and who did what, but we want the cleanup first. Gary Sayers, owner of the plating company that included three rundown buildings at 945. E. 10 Mile, began serving a one-year federal prison term last month. He was also fined $1.5 million to pay EPA costs at his buildings incurred before a toxic green substance leaked onto I-696 near his building Dec. 20, requiring more cleanup efforts. Meantime, Madison Heights is suing Sayers in Oakland County Circuit Court to pay demolition and cleanup costs for his three buildings. People are angry, and understandably so, Ellison said. This is just one of 7,000 contaminated sites in the state. The primary task is to get it cleaned up and get the money to pay for it. The state Legislature is set to introduce legislation Monday aimed at making it easier to enforce cleanup fines and penalties against environmental polluters. Ellison and Madison Heights Mayor Brian Hartwell said EGLE and EPA officials have been responsive and updated elected and other officials with weekly meetings since Dec. 20. The green viscous liquid from the site that oozed I-696 was found to contain hexavalent chromium, a cancer-causing agent, cyanide, and trichloroethylene. I have a lot of trust in the state officials because they are being honest and have worked with us since this problem bubbled up, so to speak, Hartwell said. The mayors campaign committee recently paid to mail EPA and EGLE updates on the contaminated site to a couple thousand residents who live in the area. The EPA several days ago said it has taken 29 soil samples and 33 groundwater samples from temporary monitoring wells. No traces of pollutants exceeding metrics for safe levels were found in the groundwater samples. Data on soil samples is pending, according to the EPA. The contaminants have no effect on local drinking water or soil beyond the site area, city officials said. EPA workers have collected more than 48,000 gallons of liquid from storm drains, anon-site monitoring well and the basement of the former plating company. Funding for cleaning up polluted sites like the former Electro-Plating location is a major hurdle, Harwell added. Even if they hired 100 new site inspectors today there would still be a backlog, he said. Records show Sayers received 15 warnings or violations from environmental officials for operations at his plant starting over two decades ago. There were also subsequent court orders against him and several informant complaints before he was finally charged and convicted in U.S District Court in Detroit last year. Federal prosecutors said Sayers illegally stored thousands of containers of hazardous waste rather than disposing of them legally. He also stored toxic waste in a five-foot-deep pit dug beneath the floor of the basement, prosecutors said. Pollutants from that pit are what mixed with rain and ground water before seeping out onto the shoulder of eastbound I-696 shortly before Christmas. The property was declared a Superfund site by the EPA and a first cleanup was completed in early 2018. Other officials at Mondays meeting will include State Sen. Jeremy Moss, Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter, county Water Resources Commissioner Jim Nash, Oakland County Commissioner Gary McGillivray of Madison Heights, and representatives from the state Department of Health and Human Services. EPA and EGLE representatives will answer questions from residents after their presentation. I think the majority of questions will be about exposure to chemicals and soil contamination, said Madison Heights City Manager Melissa Marsh. Residents have asked the city those questions and also about the EPA and EGLE and why (the site) wasn't inspected more. This meeting is a chance for residents to turn out in a united front and show that we want this site cleaned up. Here is a look at some of the stories you may have missed from the past week:

It's been a week packed with rhetoric from President Donald Trump. This, as his Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, played out. An AP Fact Check put his statements under scrutiny and found distortions on a range of topics. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) WASHINGTON>> Abroad, at home and in Twitter's ether, President Donald Trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the Senate impeachment trial unfolded and the Davos economic forum played out in Switzerland. On impeachment, the state of the country, abortion, pollution and more, Trump didn't tell the story straight. A week in review: MISSILE ATTACK TRUMP, on U.S. troops targeted by the Iranian missile attack in Iraq this month: "I heard they had headaches and a couple of other things ... and I can report it is not very serious. ... No, I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I've seen. ... No, I do not consider that to be bad injuries, no."  news conference Wednesday in Davos, Switzerland. THE FACTS: That assurance is misleading at best. The Pentagon said Friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to Germany or back to the U.S. for further observation and treatment. Traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life-long debilitation or death. The severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the Pentagon; evaluation of the wounded troops continues. In the first few days after the attacks, Trump inaccurately told the nation that no American service members were hurt. ___ ABORTION TRUMP on Gov. Ralph Northam, D-Va.: "The governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth."  remarks at anti-abortion rally Friday. THE FACTS: No, Northam he didn't. Trump routinely twists Northam's words, which were convoluted to begin with. Noting that late-term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive, Northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered. Then, he said, the baby would be "resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue" between doctors and the mother about what to do. In extremely rare instances, babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion. "Execution" is not an option. When a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth, a family may choose what's known as palliative care or comfort care. This might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention. Providing comfort without life-extending treatment is not specific to newborns. It may happen with fatally ill patients of any age. ___ BLUE-COLLAR 'BOOM' TRUMP: "This is a blue-collar boom. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus-47% -- three times faster than the increase for the top 1%."  remarks in Davos on Tuesday. THE FACTS: It isn't a boom for blue-collar workers. They haven't done much better than everyone else, and some of their gains under Trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing. The mining and logging industry, for example, which includes oil and gas workers, lost 21,000 jobs last year. Manufacturers have added just 9,000 jobs in the past six months, while the economy as a whole gained more than 1.1 million jobs during that period. The U.S. economy is still heavily oriented toward services. While factory jobs have grown, other jobs have grown faster, so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since Trump took office. He's right that net worth among the bottom half has risen, but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed. The Federal Reserve says the bottom half has just 1.6% of the nation's wealth, compared with 1.1% when Trump took office. It was 2.1% in 2006. ___ TRUMP: "For the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. We are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist."  Davos remarks. THE FACTS: That's not true. Wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few: The richest 1% of Americans own 32% of the nation's wealth, about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated. The middle-class share  defined by the Fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10%  remains at about 29%. This, despite the slight gains of the bottom half. The percentage of Americans who own their own homes, a key source of wealth-building, has improved modestly under Trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013. ___ OCEAN DEBRIS TRUMP: "We have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. ... We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean, where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us, and that's put there by other countries."  Davos news conference Wednesday. THE FACTS: He's right that garbage from abroad has come to U.S. shores by sea. What he does not say is that garbage from the U.S. also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that Americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores. Debris from Asia was most noticeable after the 2011 Japanese tsunami, said marine debris expert Kara Lavender Law of the Sea Education Association, "but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the U.S. and washing ashore in Asia." In fact, she said, most debris is not tracked to the country of origin. The United States produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight, Law said. "Most debris we find on the coast of the U.S. is likely from the U.S.," Denise Hardesty, a scientist who researches ocean trash for Australia's federal science organization, said by email. ___ IMPEACHMENT and UKRAINE TRUMP, on military aid to Ukraine: "Remember this, they got their money and they got it early."  interview Wednesday with Fox Business Network. TRUMP: "They got their money long before schedule."  Davos news conference. THE FACTS: They got the money months late. Congress approved nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine in the early months of 2019. U.S. officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that Trump had ordered the assistance to held back, as he pressed Ukraine to announce an investigation of Democrats. It was released Sept. 11, only after a whistleblower's complaint about Trump's pressure on Ukraine had surfaced and a few days after Democrats in Congress opened the investigation. Previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted. ___ TRUMP, on Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the lead impeachment manager for the Senate trial: "He makes a statement that I made, and it was a total fraud. I never made it. That's why I released the conversation, because if I didn't release it, people would have said that I made the statement that he made. This guy is a fraud."  Fox interview Wednesday. THE FACTS: No, Schiff spoke after Trump released the rough transcript of his July phone call, not before. Trump's claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue. The White House released the account of the conversation on Sept. 25. Schiff gave his account on Sept. 26, while leading a House Intelligence Committee hearing on the matter, as the committee chairman. Trump has made much of Schiff's account, seizing on how the Democrat put words in Trump's mouth in describing the president's conversation with Ukraine's leader. Schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally. He said he was characterizing Trump's conversation "in not so many words," attempting to describe "the essence" of it, and doing something of a "parody." Schiff based his account on the rough transcript. He did not cause it to be released. ___ TRUMP LAWYER JAY SEKULOW, on special counsel Robert Mueller: "We had the invocation of the ghost of the Mueller report. I know something about that report. It came up empty on the issue of collusion with Russia. There was no obstruction, in fact."  impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: He's wrong to suggest that Mueller's report cleared the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia. Nor did the report exonerate Trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice. Instead, the report factually laid out instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, leaving it open for Congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once Trump leaves office. "If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so," Mueller said after the report was released. Mueller's two-year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with Russians. Among them: Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer who had promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. On collusion, Mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term. He looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front. ___ SEKULOW: "During the proceedings that took place before the Judiciary Committee, the president was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses. The president was denied the right to access evidence. And the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings."  impeachment trial Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's false. The committee, which produced the articles of impeachment, invited Trump or his legal team to come. He declined. Absent White House representation, the hearings proceeded as things in Congress routinely do. Time was split between Democratic and Republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate. Lawyers for Democrats and Republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses, among them an academic called forward by Republicans. The first round of hearings was by the House Intelligence Committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases, conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation. Trump cried foul then at the lack of representation, then rejected representation when the next committee offered it. ___ BLACK COLLEGES TRUMP, on historically black colleges and universities: "I saved HBCUs. We saved them. They were going out and we saved them."  Davos remarks Tuesday. THE FACTS: That's a big stretch. Trump signed a law in December restoring money that lapsed for several months when Congress failed to reauthorize some $255 million in financing on time. The money came back because Senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools. Neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the Trump administration. The administration generally has supported historically black colleges, as previous administrations have done, and it's true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed. The Trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes. But this segment of university education was not vanishing. ___ AIR & WATER TRUMP: "I'm proud to report the United States has among the cleanest air and drinking water on Earth -- and we're going to keep it that way. And we just came out with a report that, at this moment, it's the cleanest it's been in the last 40 years."  Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, air quality has worsened under his administration. And it's a stretch to say the U.S. is among the countries with the cleanest air. Dozens of nations have less smoggy air. In the U.S. and other countries, air is better than it was during the days of full-on coal power, leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks, before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago. But by multiple measures, air quality has deteriorated in the last few years. Trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean-up of U.S. air and water a half-century ago. As to water quality, one measure, Yale University's global Environmental Performance Index, finds the U.S. tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water. But after decades of improvement, progress in air quality has stalled. There were 15% more days with unhealthy air in America in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016, according to an Associated Press analysis of EPA data. And deadly air particle pollution increased 5.5% in the U.S. between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24% from 2009 to 2016, says a Carnegie Mellon University study. The Obama administration set records for the fewest air-polluted days. ___ ECONOMY TRUMP: "We have the greatest economy we've ever had in the history of our country. And I'm in Europe today because we're bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs -- millions of jobs, in many cases. "  Davos remarks. THE FACTS: His persistent depiction of the U.S. economy as the greatest ever is false. As for jobs pouring into the country, investment by foreign companies has slumped under Trump, according to a report by the Organization for International Investment, a Washington-based association that represents foreign businesses. Foreign companies directly invested $268 billion into the U.S. economy in 2018, a decrease of nearly $220 billion from its record-breaking level in 2016 when Democrat Barack Obama was still president. On the broader picture, economic growth under Trump is not nearly the greatest ever. In the late 1990s, growth topped 4% for four straight years, a level it has not reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth reached 7.2% in 1984. The economy grew 2.9% in 2018  the same pace it reached in 2015 under Obama  and hasn't hit historically high growth rates. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low of 3.5%, but the proportion of Americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s. Wages were rising at a faster pace back then, too. This much is true: The Obama-Trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. But not the greatest. ___ TRUMP: "The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any U.S. president in recorded history. We started off with a reasonably high rate."  Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Actually, Trump started with a rate that, if anything, was reasonably low, not "reasonably high." The unemployment rate was 4.7% when Trump replaced Obama in the White House. That is below the long-term U.S. average unemployment of 5.7% since the Labor Department began compiling the data in 1948. Obama inherited a rate of 7.8%. It remained high for years -- topping 8% for a record length of time -- but gradually fell to the below-average level Trump inherited. ___ TRADE TRUMP: "Just last week alone, the United States concluded two extraordinary trade deals  the agreement with China and the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement  the two biggest trade deals ever made."  Davos remarks. THE FACTS: No, there have been larger trade deals. For instance, 123 countries signed the Uruguay Round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the World Trade Organization in 1994. The organization's initial membership accounted for more than 90% of global economic output, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found, and that was before China joined the organization. Also bigger: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have joined North America with Pacific Rim countries in freer trade. Trump took the U.S. out after the deal was negotiated and before the U.S. ratified it. The European Union, with its liberalized trade regimen, was itself formed from a giant deal. The China deal leaves tariffs in place on about $360 billion in imports from China and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations. Trump's U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement is much larger, though it's an update of the long-standing North American Free Trade Agreement worked out by Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. ___ HOUSEHOLD INCOME TRUMP: "Real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded."  Davos remarks. THE FACTS: Not really, but it would be misleading even if it were true. Real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of $63,200 first reached in 1999. That's according to adjusted figures the Census Bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time. Trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record. Either way, what the data show is that income for the median household  the one at the exact middle of the income distribution  essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years. The Census data also show that household income fell sharply after the Great Recession, then began rebounding in 2015, before Trump took office. WASHINGTON>> President Donald Trump systematically fabricated his record before boisterous supporters and the eyes of the world this past week.

Environmental concerns include petroleum products from a leaking underground storage tank and hazardous substances from former auto repair use. The Oakland County Brownfield Consortium is seeking $600,000 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to help assess contaminated properties. The Fiscal Year 2020 EPA Assessment Coalition grant would be used to conduct assessments of some of the county's most polluted properties, often referred to as brownfields. More than 1,000 of these properties are located within the county with many of them located along three corridors including 8 Mile, John R., and Telegraph roads. Some of these vacant sites include remnants of manufacturing facilities that were once reliant on the automotive industry, but closed during the recession. Other sites, which housed gas stations, auto repair shops, and car dealerships have challenged local governments to find creative uses that will foster economic growth. Brad Hansen, the county's brownfield program manager, said the grant funding is used to conduct environmental site investigations and baseline environmental assessments. "These dollars are used for environmental testing, not remediation, to determine what contaminants are on the sites, if any," he said. "The grant will also be used to look into the history of the property and its neighbors to see if there any reason to be concerned. We target these three areas because, historically, they've had some contamination. We have a pretty good belief that many of the properties are contaminated." In 2009, Oakland County created the consortium to attract federal dollars to help communities assess and clean up the polluted sites while fostering economic growth. The consortium is comprised of the county and six communities including Farmington Hills, Pontiac, Ferndale, Hazel Park, Southfield, and Farmington Hills. Oakland County Executive David Coulter said all legal remedies should be used against a local business owner cited for causing an environmenta FY 2020 Oakland County EPA Assessment Coalition Grant The county's target areas for assessment include: In November, the coalition met to discuss the county's current inventory of brownfield properties, evaluate additional properties for inclusion, and prioritize the sites for assessment. As part of this process, Hansen said each of the six coalition communities nominate a brownfield property that may be of concern to residents. "These sites are an idea of what the money could be used for," he said. "Just because these sites are identified on the grant application, that doesn't mean we have to spend money on them. If there isn't a prime reason to spend money on a site, we may not do it. If a community definitely wants to get a site taken care of, it's going to be a top priority for us here at the county." Here's a list of the priority brownfield sites identified by the coalition for Fiscal Year 2020: Last week, Oakland County Executive David Coulter testified before the House Appropriations Committee in Lansing. The testimony was focused on how the county will work with local, state, and federal officials to comprehensively remediate the "green ooze" chemical spill originating from defunct Electro-Plating Services, located in Madison Heights along 10 Mile just south of I-696. Local, state, and federal officials will host a public briefing to discuss the "green ooze" spill from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 5, at Madison High School, 915 E. 11 Mile Road. Madison Heights officials are hoping to soon get an idea from the Environmental Protection Agency on how long it will take to cleanup up a contaminated site that caused a toxic green substance to ooze onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 two weeks ago.

Contamination from the "green ooze" spill is not impacting drinking water. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) reported that preliminary test results indicate that contamination from the polluted Madison Heights Electro-Plating Services facility are neither impacting groundwater nor moving southward from the site. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tested groundwater from south of E. 10 Mile Road in Hazel Park, the opposite direction from the I-696 freeway embankment where contaminants were discovered seeping onto the shoulder Dec. 20. Those tests detected no trichlorethylene (TCE) and no hexavalent chromium, the chemicals found in the "green ooze." Results of soil samples taken from the same locations are pending. Oakland County Executive David Coulter said all legal remedies should be used against a local business owner cited for causing an environmenta Testing from the toxic Electro-Plating Services site in Madison Height expanded into Hazel Park this week. Testing from the toxic Electro-Plating Services site in Madison Height expanded into Hazel Park this week. Additionally, water systems that draw their water from Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River, downstream from the contamination, have tested their water as a precaution. They show levels of hexavalent chromium, the chemical that gave the highway liquid its green color, less than 1/1,000th of the drinking water standard. On Friday morning, test results from the Madison Heights municipal water system showed no contaminants exceeding drinking water standards, a consultant for the city reported. Tests from other water systems are pending. The EPA has launched aninteractive map that displays preliminary test resultsfortrichlorethylene (TCE), hexavalent chromium, and cyanide. The map will continue to be updated as new sampling becomes available.

Coulter was joined by Kathy Forzley, the county's director of health and human services. He spoke about putting the public's safety first, emphasizing that more tests need to be done, passing state polluter laws to hold those accountable who cause toxic spills, and how the county will work with Madison Heights to demolish the building in order to fully clean up the property. Oakland County stands ready to work with the City of Madison Heights on options for the demolition that must occur before the site can be fully cleaned up, he said.

Madison Heights officials are hoping to soon get an idea from the Environmental Protection Agency on how long it will take to cleanup up a contaminated site that caused a toxic green substance to ooze onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 two weeks ago. House Appropriations Committee Coulter Testimony on Contamination Last month, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) was made aware of toxic chemicals pouring out onto the shoulder of eastbound I-696. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently conducted soil and groundwater tests, with results pending, to understand how far the toxic chemicals have traveled and to prevent future leaks. Local and state officials have reassured residents living nearby that drinking water quality has not been impacted by the chemical spill, which will eventually end up in Lake St. Clair, according to the EPA. Tests on the chemicals showed levels of hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium 6, a cancer-causing chemical. Coulter said he would like to see deeper soil and aquifer testing conducted to ensure the contamination has not reached below the ground's clay layer. He also called for deeper monitoring wells so that thegroundwater flow direction of the deeper aquifers could be determined. "Testing is needed for a significant distance along service lines such as sewers, electrical chases, natural gas runs, and any area such as these where the groundwater will follow because of disturbances in the natural soil," he said. EGLE also took water samples from nearby storm sewers and from Bear Creek, where the sewer water emerges and becomes surface water. Results, including for PFAS, should be available this week. In February 2019, Gary Sayers, the owner of Electro-Plating Services, was sentenced to one year in federal prison for storing hazardous waste at his business. He's now being sued by the City of Madison Heights to have him demolish the building. The city also is seeking the rights to demolish the building if Sayers does not comply with a court order to do so. Coulter said it's vital that Sayers is held accountable for this "chemical catastrophe." "It is outrageous that Mr. Sayers, the business owner, for decades operated an electroplating business in such an irresponsible nearly unbelievable manner including initiating the disposal of dangerous chemicals in a dirt pit," he said. "The fact that he is in prison is small comfort given the long and expensive road ahead to address his criminal behavior." Earlier this month, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for the State Legislature to draft and pass polluter laws that would force individuals and businesses causing hazardous spills to pay for the clean up. In addition, Whitmer said her administration is actively reviewing further criminal charges against Sayers.

 The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has collected about 11,000 gallons of contaminated water from the site of a condemned plating company near I-696 in Madison Heights. Groundwater and soil samples were taken Friday from the Electro-Plating Services property on 10 Mile Road. Two weeks ago a toxic green substance seeped from site onto the freeway, alarming people throughout the region and state. The EPA reported that two sump wells installed just before Christmas have collected almost 11,000 gallons of contaminated groundwater from beneath the facility and on the highway embankment where the contamination was discovered on Dec. 20. Most of the contaminated water collected has come from a pit Electro-Platings owner dug in the basement to illegally store hazardous materials. Madison Heights has been dealing with the issue through the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) and the EPA. Twenty-five wells for testing were drilled on and near the site. Test results will help analysts evaluate the contamination. That work will help investigators find the extent and levels of contamination and seek a more permanent solution to protect the environment and human health, according to a news release from EGLE. Test results are expected within a week or two. More testing and investigation are likely to be based on the results of the initial analyses. EGLE on Thursday sampled water at the point where the affected sewer system surfaces at Bear Creek to determine levels of contaminants entering the creek. That water eventually flows into the Clinton River and then Lake St. Clair. Officials said those results from those sample should be available late next week. Chemicals tested for include hexavalent chromium and other heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and cyanide. Though no nearby homes or business use well water and are on the Great Lakes Water Authority system, EGLE is to test drinking water as a precaution. EGLE Director Liesl Clark said the Electro-Plating site is one of thousands of contaminated sites that need to be more fully addressed and that a formal review of EGLEs pollution inspection procedures is underway, as requested by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. This situation highlights a long-term challenge that we must meet, said Clark said in a statement. Thousands of contaminated properties exist in Michigan, many having languished for decades without appropriate assessment or cleanup. Thats unacceptable in a state surrounded by almost 20 percent of the worlds fresh surface water. She said contaminated sites have to be cleaned up sooner. We will start 2020 by analyzing how best to accomplish this, Clark said. I look forward to working with EGLE, local communities, our federal partners, and our Michigan Legislature to put measures in place to aggressively attack these problems. The heavy green toxic liquid in Madison Heights first showed up outside the condemned site on the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. Gary Sayers, owner of the company that caused the contamination, was sentenced in November to a year in prison and to pay $1.5 million to the EPA to cover the agencys emergency cleanup of the site a couple of years ago. Sayers over decades failed to comply with orders to legally dispose of toxic waste at the plant, illegally storing it inside thousands of containers. Over time many of them corroded and leaked. Here is a look back at the news you may missed from the past week:

Macomb Daily file photo In this 2015 file photo, a pipe carrying PCB-tainted oil that is being sucked out of a manhole vault on Bon Brae Street is shown. Macomb Daily file photo WASHINGTON (AP)  The Trump administration has built up the biggest backlog of unfunded toxic Superfund clean-up projects in at least 15 years, nearly triple the number that were stalled for lack of money in the Obama era, according to 2019 figures quietly released by the Environmental Protection Agency over the winter holidays. The accumulation of Superfund projects that are ready to go except for money comes as the Trump administration routinely proposes funding cuts for Superfund and for the EPA in general. The four-decade-old Superfund program is meant to tackle some of the most heavily contaminated sites in the U.S. and Trump has declared it a priority even while seeking to shrink its budget. "There hasn't been a sense of urgency," said Violet Donoghue, who has lived for 31 years on Bon Brae Street in St. Clair Shores. Toxic PCBs have poisoned some local soil, water and fish at nearby Lake St. Clair, and the neighborhood is one of the 34 Superfund sites where clean-up projects languished for lack of money in 2019. "I feel many people have been harmed, but that's only my opinion," Donoghue said. She said the last word from the EPA was that soil would be removed from the front of her house. "Now when they say they're cleaning it, I say, 'OK, give me the date,'" she said. The unfunded projects are in 17 states and Puerto Rico. They range from abandoned mines that discharged heavy metals and arsenic in the West to an old wood pulp site in Mississippi and a defunct dry cleaner that released toxic solvents in North Carolina. Congress created the Superfund program in 1980 after the Love Canal episode and other notorious pollution cases. Its intent is to hold polluters responsible for cleanup costs or provide taxpayer money when no responsible party can be identified. Trump "is focused on putting Americans first," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told a Senate environment committee early 2019. "There may be no better example than our success in the Superfund program." "We are in the process of cleaning up some of the nation's largest, most complex sites and returning them to productive use," Wheeler said then. But two former EPA officials whose work dealt with Superfund oversight said the growing backlog of stalled Superfund projects under the Trump administration, and steady or ebbing numbers of clean-up construction projects completed, point to a different picture. "They're misleading Congress and the public about the funds that are needed to really protect the public from exposure to the toxic chemicals," said Elizabeth Southerland, who worked for 30 years at EPA, including as director of science and technology in the water office, before retiring in 2017. ''It's detrimental." This is a "regulatory failure," said Judith Enck, who served as the EPA's regional northeastern U.S. administrator under President Barack Obama. Given the growing numbers of unfunded clean-up projects, "EPA should be knocking on the door of Congress and saying, give us more money to deal with the sites,'' Enck said. Asked what the EPA spent money on instead, and why the agency didn't ask Congress for more to deal with the growing backlog, EPA spokeswoman Maggie Sauerhage offered few specifics Thursday. The EPA's Superfund program "will continue to prioritize new construction projects based on which sites present the greatest risk to human health and the environment," Sauerhage said in an email. "Further, the agency maintains the authority to respond to and fund emergencies at these sites if there is an imminent threat to human health and the environment." She pointed to some areas where Trump's Superfund effort was more on par with that of his predecessors. Long-term remedial efforts to make sure contamination didn't rebound at existing Superfund sites, for example, averaged 64 a year under Trump. That compares with an average of 60 a year in Obama's last five years. But overall, the backlog of 34 unfunded projects is up from only 12 in 2016, Obama's last year. At the site of another of 2019's unfunded Superfund projects, Montana's Upper Tenmile mining region, which includes the community of Rimini and a subdivision downstream, the EPA has been providing bottled water to residents for the past decade in response to water supplies polluted by about 150 abandoned gold, lead and copper mines. Pollution still flows from the mines and into Upper Tenmile Creek more than 20 years after the area was added to the Superfund list. About 6 miles from Rimini in the rural Landmark subdivision is a huge pile of contaminated soil that was removed from residential yards. It was supposed to be hauled away but now has weeds growing over it after sitting untouched for several years, said Patrick Keim, who lives nearby. "It's a sword of Damocles hanging over us," Keim said. "It just seems counterproductive they would spend two or three million dollars re-mediating this piece of property, haul it off and stockpile it across the road and then run out of money and leave this big pile for everybody to look at." Montana environmental regulators also are involved in the cleanup but say they need the EPA to come through with money for the work to resume, since the federal agency is providing 90 percent of funding. Under Trump, the EPA has pointed to a different yardstick in declaring it was making progress on Superfund clean-ups  the number of cleaned-up sites officially deleted from the roster of more than 1,300 Superfund sites. In 2019, for instance, the EPA said it had deleted all or part of 27 sites from the official Superfund list, saying that was the most deletions since the George W. Bush administration. But deletions from the list typically reflect clean-up work done over decades and often completed on the ground years ago, meaning Trump is sometimes taking credit for work done under his predecessors. In 2018, for example, the EPA cited the seven Superfund sites fully or partially removed from the list in the previous year as a signature accomplishment of the Trump administration. Records showed the physical work was completed before Trump took office, The Associated Press reported at the time. Sauerhage, the EPA spokeswoman, did not directly respond to questions about the backlog of 34 unfunded Superfund clean-up projects. The EPA posted the total on its website without fanfare the day after Christmas. Some of the projects that are ready to start have languished for lack of money since Trump's first year in office. EPA has been one of the main focuses of Trump's efforts to cut federal regulations and oversight that he sees as burdening businesses. Trump each year has asked Congress for nearly one-third cuts in EPA's budget, and has sought much smaller cuts for Superfund. Congress has kept both levels of funding roughly even. ___ White contributed from St. Clair Shores, Michigan, and Brown from Billings, Montana.

DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY The "green ooze" that was leaking onto Interstate 696 near Couzens Road in Madison Heights, close to the Warren border. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO As drivers on westbound Interstate 696 pass by on Sunday, Dec. 29, 2019, crews contracted by the EPA work to clean up chemicals leaching onto the eastbound lanes in Madison Heights. DAVID ANGELL -- FOR THE MACOMB DAILY Storm drains in Warren connected to Interstate 696 are not contaminated with a hazardous chemical related to the green substance which oozed from the embankment on the eastbound side of the freeway in neighboring Madison Heights, officials said. Warren Mayor Jim Fouts said inspectors assigned to the industrial pre-treatment program at the Warren Waste Water Treatment Plant checked all storm drains that potentially could have been contaminated with the green goo, and found no pollution from the spill. "Great news," Fouts said. "I emphasize they checked all drains in Warren connected to 696 and found no contamination. We also closely monitor four businesses that use hexavalent." Tests on the so-called green ooze showed levels of hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium 6, a cancer-causing chemical. It is used in industry for the chrome plating on vehicles. On Monday, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced her administration is looking into additional criminal charges against the operators of the abandoned Electro-Plating Services, the industrial company in Madison Heights linked to the green ooze and chemicals leaking from the site and onto the freeway, between Dequindre Road and John R. "The ongoing situation in Madison Heights is very concerning, and further stresses the need to enforce protections that keep Michiganders safe," said Whitmer, noting that she also wants to toughen pollution inspection and enforcement efforts. She said the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has been ordered to review how the agency inspects industrial discharges. "My administration is actively reviewing all means of accountability, including further criminal charges against the polluter who caused this mess. Today I also directed EGLE to conduct a formal review of its pollution inspection procedures to strengthen enforcement and accountability," the governor said in a prepared statement. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel echoed support of Whitmer's actions, saying her office would do "everything in our power" to assist the governor's office. She also announced the formation of a new criminal unit for environmental cases. "I have recently added new resources to our Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division and am creating a Criminal Unit that will focus specifically on environmental prosecutions," she said. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led crews have been working to prevent further leaks after a flow of a green liquid substance was observed spilling through an embankment wall onto the eastbound side of I-696 between John R and Dequindre roads. They are trying to determine how much of the chemical may have leached through into groundwater, which eventually would reach Lake St. Clair. Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said Tuesday the results of testing by Warren officials is indeed good news, providing a degree of relief. I feel very good. I certainly applaud the efforts of Mayor Fouts and his team and being extremely pro-active and doing the testing they did, Miller said. I think the citizens of Warren can feel a high degree of confidence that in Macomb County we take these things seriously. Miller isnt breathing a complete sigh of relief, however. She said the threat to waterways and Lake St. Clair continues because of chemicals that leached onto the surface and into soil. Noting the green ooze, Miller said she is troubled that EGLE told the EPA as late as last spring that chemicals werent migrating. When in fact it was, Miller said. The Macomb County public works boss believes the embankment along I-696 in the area of the ooze potentially would have to be excavated. Miller said environmental engineers from her department will continue to be on site at Electro-Plating Services as work there continues. We are going to partner with EGLE and EPA to understand what their plan is, she added. On Sunday, Miller expressed concern that both EGLE and the EPA "did not adequately follow through" in initial cleanup measures. She feels the property requires long-term remediation and wants to see it demolished. State officials three years ago ordered Electro-Plating Services to close after discovering hundreds of corroded drums and vats of hazardous waste on the site. The property underwent a $1.5 million environmental partial cleanup in 2017 after it was named a Superfund site. The company's owner, Gary Sayers of Bloomfield Township, pleaded guilty in February in federal court to illegal storage of hazardous waste and sentenced to serve one year in prison. He is expected to surrender to authorities in the first quarter of 2020. Sayers also was ordered to pay $1.5 million restitution. Hugh McDiarmid Jr., a spokesman for EGLE, said Monday the department is working with federal and local officials to review decades of decision-making and testing at the site. It's not known how long the fact gathering will take. "It is important to note that significant cleanup and enforcement actions have taken place over the last three years, including property condemnation, a cease-and-desist order that stopped the polluting process, a criminal conviction, and a $1.5 million-$2 million federal emergency cleanup of thousands of drums of waste and contaminated liquid," McDiarmid said in an email.

MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO According to the EPA, the agency has dispatched personnel to respond to the site to remove contamination that is migrating off the property. Those actions include:  Removing contaminated water that had leaked onto I-696 and into the catch basins of the sewer system.  Installing two sumps. The first, in the basement pit of the Electro-Plating Services building, to collect and remove water from the basement into a portable tank to prevent water from migrating off-site. The second, a collection system along the embankment wall of I-696 which has been plumbed to discharge into a frac-tank that has been placed on the shoulder of the highway. Both sumps are operational 24 hours a day.  Collecting more than 7,000 gallons of liquid from storm drains, the on-site monitoring well and the basement of the former plating facility.  Beginning an expanded assessment to determine what further actions may be necessary, including drilling test wells to evaluate how far contamination has migrated through area soil. Madison Heights officials are seeking a court order to have Sayers demolish the abandoned building. A trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 13 in Oakland County Circuit Court. Fouts noted that many industries are starting to switch to a fake paint which gives the same appearance as the use of hexavalent chromium. The state of Michigan should mandate that hexavalent be discontinued and the use of fake paint be used as a replacement, the mayor said. I'm also very impressed with the effort and expertise that Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller has demonstrated in her effort to protect Macomb County from this highly toxic ooze in Oakland County. Fouts also commended Warren Waste Treatment Director Bryan Clor for his effort to get the inspections of the storm drains started. This report was updated at 12:40 p.m. Tuesday, Dec. 31.

MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO Erin Brockovich PHOTO FROM FACEBOOK The old Electro-Plating Services' sign. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PHOTO Preliminary test results of soil and groundwater at and near the site of the green ooze on Interstate 696 show no risk to drinking water but high levels of multiple contaminants. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said in a news release late Friday afternoon that complete data from the testing will be available after a quality control review is complete next week. Test of water in the storm sewers near the site showed levels of hexavalent chromium at 0.14 milligrams per liter. The standard for drinking water is 0.10 mg/L. Officials had previously indicated that chemical was found. The EGLE said drinking water intakes in Lake St. Clair have not been impacted. The storm sewer eventually enters Lake St. Clair miles away, EGLE said.At that point, concentrations would be well below detectable levels although still a significant concern for incremental accumulation in the ecosystem. The green liquid substance was found last Friday spilling onto the eastbound side of the freeway between John R and Dequindre roads in Madison Heights through an embankment wall. Officials learned it came from a nearby business, Electro-Plating Services on 10 Mile Road, that was shut down by the state three years ago "after inspectors discovered hundreds of corroded drums, vats and other containers of hazardous waste at the site," according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It waspartially cleaned up by the EPA. Clean-up efforts at the site, near the Warren border, have begun. The EPA-conducted tests also showed high levels of contaminants in the groundwater between the building and the I-696 service drive, including chromium, trichloroethylene and cyanide  all chemicals previously used in the EPS facility, EGLE said. "Since 1967, the company used copper, tin, bronze, cadmium, nickel, chrome, gold, silver, zinc and lead for various electroplating operations, resulting in the contamination," the EPA said in 2017. Soil tests on the embankment where the green liquid appeared on the shoulder also showed hexavalent chromium, as well as multiple heavy metals and other contaminants at levels below the threshold for direct human contact, EGLE said Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller earlier Friday called the leak life-threatening and terrifying. Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller speaks at her office. MACOMB DAILY FILE PHOTO The toxic waste coming from this business site in Madison Heights is life-threatening and terrifying, Miller said in a prepared statement. The current conditions in that business  conditions after a $1.5 million EPA-led cleanup  tells me that guidelines on how such cleanups are conducted are inadequate. The bare minimum was done on this clean up. This situation requires both immediate and long-term remediation. The building should be demolished and the surrounding soils tested and excavated. A strong advocate for clean water, Miller said the discovery may have been a blessing in disguise as it led to the revelation of an incredibly dangerous situation at this abandoned business. This incident has shown that deadly chemicals from this site can leach out and have the potential of making their way all the way to Lake St. Clair and thereby entering our drinking water supply. The incident has gained national attention. Hexavalent chromium is the same chemical found in groundwater in California that led Erin Brokovich to help a campaign building a case against thePacific Gas and Electric Co.in 1993 that inspired the 2000 movie, Erin Brockovich." Brockovich posted about it Monday on her Facebook page. Nothing like being thought of around the holiday season for 'Green Ooze,' Brockovich wrote. We will be following up to insure the chromium doesn't contaminate any surface water bodies ... and that the ground water and soils are indeed thoroughly cleaned up. The chemical is a carcinogen, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It is used in the industrial process to increase hardening-ability and corrosion resistance of steel. EPS and its owner, Gary Sayers, were charged with illegal operation of a hazardous waste facility by U.S. Attorneys. Sayers was sentenced in November in U.S. District Court in Detroit to one year and one day in prison. He is to begin serving early next year. The location was declared a Superfund site by the EPA. Since the spill, the grassy slope and shoulder have been fenced off, and the Couzens Road exit lane and a right lane have been closed and will remain closed indefinitely, said Diane Cross of the Michigan Department of Transportation. There is no timetable (for the closures), she said. It will definitely go into January. A pit in the basement of Electro-Plating Services in Madison Heights in December 2017. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PHOTO EGLE said the EPA conducted a cleanup of the site in 2017. It removed hazardous chemicals and pumping contaminated liquid from an earthen pit in the basement of the facility. This clean-up addressed the immediate hazards on the site but was not intended to address all environmental impacts, EGLE said. EGLE said that late next week the EPA will begin dozens of soil borings to help determine the extent and levels of contamination. Regulators continue to work on the site daily, including the following activities, according to EGLE: * Daily vacuuming of nearby catch basins. * Maintenance and inspection of sump pumps collecting contaminated water from both inside the facility and on the highway embankment. * Daily monitoring of air in the building using hand-held monitors. * Preparing for the impact of rain and freezing weather. EGLE said that gravel that partially filled a basement pit at EPS following the EPA clean-up ... was saturated with green water and there was 2-3 inches of frozen water on top of the gravel. A sump was dug into the gravel and a float-operated pump was installed. The water is being pumped into a 20,000-gallon portable tank on site, EGLE said. EPA contractors will continue to remove water from the basement at EPS while a long-term remedy is developed.

STATE OF MICHIGAN PHOTO The former Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. FILE PHOTO A green liquid that leaked on to Interstate 696 in Madison Heights came from a company whose owner was recently sentenced to one year in prison for illegally operating a hazardous material facility. The liquid was found Friday afternoon oozing on to the eastbound side of the freeway near Couzens Road near the Warren border. It was determined the substance, which contained Hexavalent chromium,originated from Electro-Plating Services, 945 E. 10 Mile Road, which was shut down three years ago by what was known then as the state Department of Environmental Quality. It was later declared a Superfund site by the federal Environmental Protection Agency for illegal storage of hazardous material. The company and its owner, Gary Alfred Sayers, were charged with a crime and sentenced Nov. 5 to one year in prison in U.S. District Court in Detroit. Sayers and the company were ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution for the cost of the clean-up, which was completed in January 2018. Materials included cyanide, chromium, chloride and various acids as part of its plating process, and were stored in drums, containers and a pit dug in the ground. In the recent incident, the Michigan Department of Transportation reported a green liquid substance leaking from a retaining wall along the embankment. A liquid substance leaks on to Interstate 696 on Friday in Madison Heights. MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PHOTO A HAZMAT team and local, state and federal officials responded and stopped the leak and have been conducting a clean-up and containment. Hexavalent chromium is a carcinogen that is harmful if inhaled or exposed to unprotected skin. The Couzens exit lane and ramp and the right thru-lane were closed and will remain closed until at least Friday while officials await the results of test samples to determine if other substances were also present. Jill Greenberg, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, said Monday that HAZMAT workers vacuumed storm sewers and catch basins in the area and placed a sump-pump in the business basement to prevent groundwater from spreading. A fence was erected on the embankment to prevent anyone from entering the contaminated area, she added. Greenberg said there has been no evidence that anyone has come into contact with the substance or that any drinking water was impacted. Theres no imminent danger to drinking water, she said. Some of the substance may have migrated from the area into a nearby drain and eventually into Lake St. Clair but that has not been determined. She said officials will decide the next phase of operation after the test results are learned Friday. A clean-up could involve removing the embankment in the area. State Rep. Lori Stone, D-Warren, vowed Monday to "remain vigilant" inmonitoring and correcting the situation.

State Sen.Jeremy Moss,D-Southfield, and state Rep.Jim Ellison,D-Royal Oak, added in a joint statement: Preventable situations such as this are why we must act with urgency to enforce stronger policies to hold polluters accountable and protect our residents." Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice S. Miller commended the quick response but said the incident points out the need for a coordinated monitoring plan to protect Great Lakes water quality. Michigan EGLE and EPA were quickly on the job and engaged in this clean up on what was essentially a holiday weekend, Miller said in a written statement. This issue points out the need to monitor and have a means to capture the storm water off our major freeways  which amounts to millions of gallons of water per year directly entering into Lake St. Clair and the Great Lake system. Whether Electro-Plating Services and the owner will face other sanctions has not been determined. Miller said her agency is concerned that the groundwater around the business was not tested, in light of the $1.5 million clean-up. We cannot continue to operate the way that we have in the past," she said. "The Great Lakes are a world treasure, and we must work together to serve as their guardians. A single drop of this chromium 6 contamination that might enter the lake is one drop too much." Miller noted that this year Macomb County Public Works has responded to several instances of oil sheens, cement run-off and old paint entering into the county drains. MCPWO operates a 24-hour spill response emergency number, (877) 679-4337. Those who see an emergency situation may also call 911.
