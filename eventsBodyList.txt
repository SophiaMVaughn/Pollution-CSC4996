John Flesher The Associated PressCaptionCloseCROSSROADS, N.M. >> Carl Johnson and son Justin are third- and fourth-generation ranchers who for decades have battled oilfield companies that left a patchwork of barren earth where the men graze cattle in the high plains of New Mexico. Blunt and profane, they stroll across a 1½-acre patch of sandy soil — lifeless, save for a scattering of stunted weeds.Five years ago, a broken pipe soaked the land with as much as 420,000 gallons of oilfield wastewater — a salty and potentially toxic drilling byproduct that can quickly turn fertile land into a dead zone. The leaked brine killed every sprig of grama and bluestem grasses and shinnery shrubs it touched.For the Johnsons, the spill is among dozens that have taken a heavy toll: a landscape pockmarked with spots where livestock can no longer graze, legal fees running into the tens of thousands and worries about the safety of the area’s underground aquifer.“If we lose our water, that ruins our ranch,” Justin Johnson said. “That’s the end of the story.”Their plight illustrates a largely overlooked side effect of oil and gas production that has worsened with the past decade’s drilling boom: spills of wastewater that foul the land, kill wildlife and threaten freshwater supplies.An Associated Press analysis of data from leading oil- and gas-producing states found more than 175 million gallons of wastewater spilled from 2009 to 2014 in incidents involving ruptured pipes, overflowing storage tanks and other mishaps or even deliberate dumping. There were some 21,651 individual spills. And these numbers are incomplete because many releases go unreported.Though oil spills tend to get more attention, wastewater spills can be more damaging. And in seven of the 11 states the AP examined, the amount of wastewater released was at least twice that of oil discharged.Spilled oil, however unsightly, over time is absorbed by minerals in the soil or degraded by microbes. Not so with the wastewater, also known as brine, produced water or saltwater. Unless thoroughly cleansed, a costly and time-consuming process, salt-saturated land dries up. Trees die. Crops cannot take root.“Oil spills may look bad, but we know how to clean them up and ... return the land to a productive state,” said Kerry Sublette, a University of Tulsa environmental engineer and specialist in treating the despoiled landscapes. “Brine spills are much more difficult.”In addition to the extreme salinity, the fluids often contain heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury, plus radioactivity. Even smaller discharges affecting an acre or two gradually add up for landowners — “death by a thousand bee stings,” said Don Shriber of Farmington, New Mexico, a cattleman who wrangled with an oil company over damage.For animals, the results can be fatal. Ranchers, including Melvin Reed of Shidler, Oklahoma, said they have lost cattle that lapped up the liquids or ate tainted grass.“They get real thin. It messes them up,” Reed said. “Sometimes you just have to shoot them.”The AP obtained data from regulatory agencies in Texas, North Dakota, California, Alaska, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Kansas, Utah and Montana — states that account for more than 90 percent of the nation’s onshore oil production. Officials in ninth-ranking oil producer Louisiana and second-ranking gas producer Pennsylvania said they could not provide comprehensive spill data.The spill total increased each year, along with oil and gas production. In 2009, there were 2,470 reported spills in the 11 states; by 2014, the total was 4,643. The amount of wastewater spilled doubled from 21.1 million gallons in 2009 to 43 million in 2013 before dipping to 33.5 million last year.The extent of land or water contamination is unknown; state and federal regulators make no such assessments. Texas, the nation’s biggest oil and gas producer, had the most incidents, 4,783, and the highest volume spilled, 62 million gallons.Industry groups and regulators said much of the waste is recovered during cleanup operations or contained by berms near wells. Still, they acknowledged a certain amount soaks into the ground and can flow into waterways.“You’re going to have spills in an industrial society,” said Katie Brown, spokeswoman for Energy In Depth, a research and education arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. “But there are programs in place to reduce them.”Wastewater spills have dogged the oil industry from its earliest days more than a century ago, borne witness by barren sites from the Great Plains to the Pacific. A notorious symbol is the “Texon scar,” where brine from a well drilled in 1923 near that tiny West Texas town created a desolate 2,000-acre swath dotted with dead mesquite trees. Efforts to restore the land continue to this day, said range conservationist Joe Petersen.Concentrated brine, much saltier than seawater, exists naturally in rock formations thousands of feet underground, a remnant of prehistoric oceans. When oil and gas are pumped to the surface, the water comes too, along with fluids and chemicals injected to crack open rock — the process known as hydraulic fracturing. Production of methane gas from coal deposits also generates wastewater, but it is less salty and harmful.The spills usually occur as oil and gas are channeled to metal tanks for separation from the wastewater, and the water is delivered to a disposal site — usually an injection well that pumps it back underground. Pipelines, tank trucks and pits are potential weak points.Accidents range from the mundane to the freakish; in 2010, a storage tank near Ardmore, Oklahoma, overflowed after a snake slithered into a panel box and blew a fuse. Most spills are caused by equipment malfunction or human error, according to state reports reviewed by the AP.Though no full accounting of damage exists, the scope is sketched out in a sampling of incidents:• In North Dakota, a spill of nearly 1 million gallons in 2006 caused a massive die-off of fish, turtles and plants in the Yellowstone River and a tributary. Cleanup costs approached $2 million. Two larger spills since then scoured vegetation along an almost 2-mile stretch and fouled a creek and a river.• Wastewater from unlined pits seeped beneath a 6,000-acre cotton and nut farm near Bakersfield, California, and contaminated groundwater. Oil giant Aera Energy was ordered in 2009 to pay $9 million to grower Fred Starrh, who had to remove 2,000 acres from production.• Brine leaks exceeding 40 million gallons over decades on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana polluted a river, private wells and the municipal water system in Poplar. “It was undrinkable,” said resident Donna Whitmer. “If you shook it up, it’d look all orange.” Under a 2012 settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, oil companies paid $320,000 for new water wells and other improvements. Drinking water tainted with oilfield brine can cause high blood pressure, dehydration and other health risks, EPA spokeswoman Sarah Teschner said.• In Fort Stockton, Texas, officials in February accused oil company Bugington Energy of illegally dumping 3 million gallons of wastewater in pastures. Paul Weatherby, general manager of the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District, said he fears contamination of the area’s groundwater table. The district levied a $130,000 fine but the company hasn’t paid, contending the district overstepped its authority.• A pipeline joint failure caused flooding on Don Stoker’s ranch near Snyder, Texas, in November 2012 and turned his hackberry shade trees into skeletons. Vacuum trucks sucked up some saltwater and the oil company paid damages, but Stoker said his operation was in turmoil. “I had to stay out there three days and watch them while they were getting the saltwater out, to make sure they didn’t totally destroy the whole area.”Government agencies acknowledge having a limited view of the accidents, which often happen in remote places and, unlike oil spills, don’t produce dramatic images of birds flailing in black goo and tourist beaches fouled. Regulators rely on private operators to notify them, and it’s not always required. For example, Oklahoma exempts reporting of most spills of less than 10 barrels, or 420 gallons.The loudest whistleblowers are often property owners, who must allow drilling access to their land if they don’t own the mineral rights.“Most ranchers are very attached to the land,” said Jeff Henry, president of the Osage County Cattlemen’s Association in Oklahoma. “It’s where we derive our income, raise our families. It’s who we are.”A big reason why there are so many spills is the sheer volume of wastewater extracted: about 10 barrels for every barrel of oil, according to an organization of state ground water agencies, or more than 840 billion gallons a year.Sometimes, the exact cause is never determined. The Johnsons have yet to learn why an underground line ruptured in at least two places on the state-owned land they lease for ranching. A salty, oily odor wafted heavily on the breeze when Justin Johnson reached the site in October 2010.“I was just totally and thoroughly disgusted,” he said.New Mexico Salt Water Disposal Co. acknowledged responsibility. No fines were levied because the leak was accidental. Vice President Rory McGinn blamed practices and materials the company no longer uses, saying in an interview that “an enormous amount of money” has gone into upgrades.The company said much the same in 2005 after earlier spills, telling the state in a letter obtained through a records request it had spent nearly $250,000 on higher-grade pipe, tanks and valves and “our objective and goal is to be 100 percent maintenance and environmentally safe in our operation.”The company has had a dozen spills since 2003, said Larry Behrens of the New Mexico Department of Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources.Despite such incidents, relatively few farmers and ranchers complain publicly. Some get royalty checks for wells on their property. Others don’t want to be seen as opposing an industry that is the economic backbone of their communities.“If they treat us right, we’re all friends of oil,” said Mike Artz, a grower in North Dakota’s Bottineau County who lost a five-acre barley crop in 2013 after a saltwater pipeline rupture. “But right now, it’s just a horse running without the bridle.”Oil and gas developers said they have everything to gain from stopping spills, which cost them money for cleanup and soil restoration.Sara Hughes, spokeswoman for pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, said her company has lowered water injection pressure and installed additional leak-detection devices on its lines since its spill on Stoker’s land.“We are committed to public safety, protection of the environment and operation of our facilities in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations,” Hughes said.In North Dakota, where the spills increased at a higher rate than the well count during the boom years of 2009-’14, pipelines near waterways must have leak prevention devices but not those elsewhere; critics said that shows the oil industry’s political clout. Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, said more devices would be costly and wouldn’t necessarily catch small leaks.Tessa Sandstrom, of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said the industry is cooperating with scientists studying prevention and land restoration. When spills do happen, she said, most are cleaned up within a year.But Bottineau County grain farmer Daryl Peterson said it took years of prodding before regulators ordered an oil company to dig up 300 truckloads of tainted soil on his property and replace it. The soil is still salty, he said.Sublette, the University of Tulsa engineer, said soil excavation and replacement is unreliable because some operators “bring in the nastiest stuff they can find.” He recommends extensive flushing with fresh water to remove salts from the zone where plants take root, then rebuilding the soil with nurturing additives. Even done correctly, it can take years to get plants growing again.Similar methods were used on the Johnsons’ pastures, but father and son said the land has not come back to life.“It will never, ever be like it was,” Justin Johnson said, giving a bleached-white stone a desultory kick. “It will never fully recover.”

GILLIAN FLACCUS Associated PressTHERMAL, Calif. -- Community activists in Southern California's Coachella Valley have been toiling for years along the eastern rim of this crescent-shaped breadbasket to spread the word about the abandoned waste dumps, shoddy migrant housing and overburdened recycling facilities that are a fact of life in this poor, farmworker community.Their work paid off last month, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state regulators cracked down on a soil recycling plant that was blamed by air quality officials for a putrid stench that sickened dozens of children and teachers at a nearby school.Now, the groups are taking advantage of that national spotlight -- including a visit from U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer -- to press for similar action at other toxic sites that dot the remote valley, from an abandoned and illegal dump to a mountain of human sewage that locals dubbed Mt. San Diego because it was trucked in from San Diego County.Activists will take state lawmakers and state and federal regulatory officials on an "environmental justice" bus tour Friday with stops at a laundry list of sites that represent potential environmental hazards. It's the second such tour the group has organized this year since forming an environmental task force that includes officials from all levels of government, with the goal of improving living conditions in the sun-baked Coachella Valley.The tour on Friday precedes a state legislative committee hearing on environmental safety and toxins that will be held at the local high school here.The federal crackdown on soil recycler Western Environmental, Inc., which sits on tribal land, was the first major success after a coalition of civil rights and migrant advocacy groups began using an evolving strategy, said Megan Beaman, an attorney with California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc. The group used to try to make its point by filing lawsuits against major polluters or negligent landlords but recently realized that's not enough, she said."We need a lot more people at the table and a lot more resources," she said. "We are looking at this as an opportunity to create a model of enforcement ... that will carry on to other places in our community and around the state."The valley roughly 130 miles southeast of Los Angeles is well-known for the glitzier cities such as Palm Springs and Palm Desert that sit on its western edge, but dusty towns to the east like Mecca, Thermal and Indio skirt the northern tip of the Salton Sea and seem a world away from the fairways and swimming pools of their neighbors. Farmworkers, many of them migrants, toil in the agricultural fields that define this heavily irrigated region and come home to dangerously overcrowded trailer parks with limited septic systems and jerry-rigged electrical systems.Recycling plants, dumps and other businesses unwelcome in more metropolitan areas set up shop years ago in the eastern valley and continue to present health hazards.In March, the newly formed environmental task force ramped up an online site where residents can log in and document environmental hazards in their community, including unexplained fumes and pollution, said Beaman, whose group is one of the main organizations working in the valley.Both the so-called "toxic tours" and the online site are ideas borrowed from the nearby Imperial Valley, where poor and mostly migrant residents deal with similar issues, she said. The online log of residents' complaints has been used there to identify safety issues previously unknown to regulators, organizers say, and they hope it will have the same effect in the Coachella Valley.Darryl Adams, the interim superintendent of the Coachella Valley Unified School District, moved to the region a year ago and took the first bus tour that activists offered earlier this year. He signed up after students at one of his elementary schools in Mecca were sickened by fumes that were later traced to Western Environmental, whose facilities are visible from the school's playground.Adams said he was stunned by the things he saw on the tour, especially the living conditions in the migrant encampments."I could not believe what I saw and ever since that day it's been my purpose in life ... to eventually do something about those living conditions," he said. "Why is the eastern Coachella Valley being seen as a dump site or a recycling place when you have people in homes and the agricultural industry out here? Why isn't something being done out here?'"The EPA issued an order last month that temporarily shut down Western Environmental after dozens of children at the school got sick from a "rotten egg" smell that had drifted across the community on and off for months. The order temporarily bans Western from accepting new shipments of soil contaminated with petroleum and other hazardous substances and instructed the company to reduce and cover 40-foot-tall piles of dirt that lined the property it leases from the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians.Western, which has taken steps to address the order, has challenged the findings of regulators who traced the stench to its operations. It is working with regulators to reopen.It was to be one of about a half-dozen sites visited by the environmental tour planned by community activists.Other likely stops include a tire recycling facility where a fire broke out last month; the human sewage pile; an abandoned dump on land owned by the Torres Martinez Band of Mission Indians and a migrant housing camp.

Fire crews extinguished the blaze atA roughly seven-mile stretch of the Houston Ship Channel has been closed due to contaminants spilling out of the Intercontinental Terminals Co. in Deer Park.The Ship Channel closure starts at Tucker Bayou, where ITC is located, and goes out toward Galveston Bay. The Lynchburg Ferry is located roughly in the middle of this closed portion, according to the U.S. Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Services.There is no way around the closed portion, meaning ships at the most inland part of the ship channel, known as the Turning Basin, will remain there until it reopens. Ships destined for the Turning Basin and other more inland destinations will likewise be halted.The latest on ITC: Wall surrounding tank farm at charred Deer Park plant breachesThere were 54 vessels in transit when the order was given to close the ship channel. Around 2:15 p.m., there were 41 vessels in transit outside the affected area. The 13 vessels not moving would be a fair estimate of ships immediately affected, according to the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Services.The Coast Guard did not know how long the Ship Channel would be closed.According to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the dike surrounding the ITC chemical storage tanks damaged by this week's fire had been breached. Booms had been put in place, and there's action being taken to contain runoff from the breach with additional booms.ITC's contractor, at the direction of TCEQ, and the Coast Guard are skimming and pumping contaminated runoff into storage containers. The Port Houston Fire Department is also assisting with response.

By David Hunn, Houston ChronicleCaptionCloseOil and gas drilling in Texas shale plays pollutes the air, erodes soil and contaminates water, while the disposal of millions of gallons of wastewater causes earthquakes, a consortium of the state’s top scientists concluded. In the most comprehensive analysis of the environmental and social impacts of drilling and hydraulic fracturing, the Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas found that the shale oil boom that delivered so much prosperity to Texas also has degraded natural resources, overwhelmed small communities, and even boosted the frequency and severity of traffic collisions as workers and equipment rush to oil fields. Fracking, which uses a high-pressured concoction of water, sand and chemicals to free oil and gas from dense shale rock, is also spreading rapidly across Texas, the study noted. Some companies are even leasing mineral rights under Texas cities. “We’re seeing these activities in places we haven’t seen before. And we’re seeing them at an increasing scale, pace and intensity,” said Marilu Hastings, vice president of sustainability programs for the Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation, which funded a portion of the research. Texans are asking reasonable questions, she said: “Is it safe? Are my children safe? Is my water safe? What about the environment? What about my land?” The analysis is likely to increase the scrutiny of fracking, particularly as a second shale boom gets underway in the Permian Basin in West Texas and other shale plays in the state. No one, including the scientists who conducted the study, expect oil and gas companies to slow production. But the report may boost pressure on the firms to drill more carefully, keep operations out of populated areas, and consider more environmentally friendly fracking technologies.Houston’s Apache Corp., for instance, is experimenting with a large-scale water recycling program in West Texas, where it has come under significant scrutiny as it develops a new oil field near Balmorhea State Park and local springs that provide water for farming, drinking supplies and the park’s famous pool. The Texas  Parks & Wildlife Department, meanwhile, has launched an unprecedented study of wildlife, plants and water nearby to monitor the environmental impact of Apache’s project.Hydraulic fracturing remains controversial, across the country and around the world. States like Maryland, New York and Vermont have banned the practice, as have countries like France, Germany and Scotland. Counties in California, New Mexico and Colorado, among others, have tried with some success. Even Denton, a North Texas city of about 130,00, adopted a fracking ban before the Texas  Legislature passed a law to prevent it. “There’s significant debate in the public about shale development,” said Kris Nygaard, an Exxon Mobil consultant who participated in the Texas study. “And I think we can all agree the most healthy and informative debates surround real data, hard facts, hard information.”The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas is the state’s top scientific community. It includes all of the state’s Nobel  laureates, plus Texas-based members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.It launched its fracking review two years ago, putting together a task force of attorneys, geologists, seismologists and engineers, including representatives from oil companies and an environmental group.The group’s conclusions are based on the review and analysis of hundreds of academic studies, many involving Texas oil and gas operations. The report noted that the state has no single database tracking environmental impacts, no system for conducting regular research on plants and animals affected, and little detail on wastewater spills from shale drilling and fracking. There is also limited data concerning exposure to toxins in the air. The report calls for the state to do better in monitoring and collecting data. In addition to highlighting concerns, the report also aimed to correct misstatements and misunderstandings about shale drilling. For example, surface spills, not fracking, are the most likely drinking water contaminants, the study found. Oil reservoirs are typically so much deeper than freshwater aquifers that contamination between the two is “unlikely,” the report said, “and it has not been observed in Texas.” And the study found little evidence to connect shale oil production emissions to health effects, adding  there isn’t much research on the issue. “There are a lot of people who are afraid of hydraulic fracturing,” said University of Houston professor and former Schlumberger petroleum engineer Christine Ehlig-Economides, who chaired the task force. “Hopefully, we have clarified what are not concerns.”But the 204-page report still found a litany of worries about fracking and suggested a bevy of new research.Specifically: Scientists need to better track baseline land and habitat conditions near oil and gas fields, the report said, and record changes to wildlife and vegetation over time.  Landowners in Texas who do not own the mineral rights on their land have little control over oil and gas operations. Most states with shale resources have a surface damage act to protect landowners; Texas should consider one. Data on wastewater spills and leaks are less accessible and detailed than in other states. Texas should improve requirements to identify sources and responses. “I’m a seismologist,” said Brian Stump, a professor at Southern Methodist University and member of the task force. “But this shale gas development is critically important to a state like Texas because of its economy, and important internationally because of its energy resources. Understanding the good and bad implications helps us know what’s right and what to improve.”David.hunn@chron.com

By Jennifer HillerCaptionCloseA study of water wells in the Eagle Ford Shale oil field in South Texas showed evidence of contamination from industrial or agricultural activities. The study, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, found instances of bubbly water that indicated dissolved gas was present. It also found abnormal chloride/bromide ratios — an indication of contamination — and volatile organic compounds, known as VOCs.Shale oil production is the biggest industry in the area, but it isn’t the only one, the study noted. There’s also poultry, cattle and grass production.Scientists took samples from 77 private water wells in Atascoca, DeWitt, Gonzales, Karnes and Wilson counties, some as shallow as 70 feet; others as deep as 2,800 feet. The wells tapped the Carrizo-Wilcox, Yegua-Jackson and Gulf Coast aquifers, which form a “leaky artesian aquifer system” in the region. The takeaway, Hildenbrand said, was that not all of the contamination is coming from human activity — there’s also naturally occurring contamination, “namely arsenic.” The arsenic may be coming from a layer of volcanic ash, the study said.For more on this report, go to ExpressNews.com or Tuesday’s Business section.jhiller@express-news.netTwitter: @Jennifer_Hiller

Matthew Brown, Associated PressHurricane Harvey's floodwaters triggered a spill of almost a half-million gallons of gasoline from two storage tanks along the Houston Ship Channel, marking the largest spill reported to date from a storm that slammed into the heart of Texas' huge petrochemical industry.The spill measured 10,988 barrels, or more than 461,000 gallons, and occurred at a petroleum tank farm in Galena Park operated by Magellan Midstream Partners, according to the Oklahoma-based company and accident reports submitted to federal officials.Some of the spilled fuel flowed into a waterway adjacent to the ship channel, a heavily-industrialized area that's lined with dozens of petrochemical facilities, the reports said.Gasoline is more volatile than oil, meaning it evaporates more quickly after it's spilled. But it's also more likely to catch fire than oil and can more rapidly penetrate the soil and potentially contaminate groundwater supplies.Magellan spokesman Bruce Heine said the gasoline that reached the small, unnamed waterway had been contained. The spilled fuel was sprayed with foam to prevent it from releasing harmful vapors, he said."Federal and state regulators have been on-site during the recovery and clean-up procedures," Heine said. "Clean-up activities at the facility are continuing and we are currently removing and replacing affected soil."The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency were unable to immediately answer questions about possible health effects and environmental contamination from the spill.CEQ spokeswoman Andrea Morrow said the agency will investigate the accident to determine if Magellan had complied with its operating permit and state rules that require the company to disclose any air pollution emitted by the spilled gasoline.The spill was first reported to state and federal officials on Aug. 31, but no volume was given at that time. The company next reported the spill was 1,000 barrels. In a report filed last week and released Monday, Magellan put the spill 10 times higher at 10,988 barrels.Heine said state and federal regulators had been notified promptly of the company's best assessments of the volume.The Associated Press has identified more than two dozen spills from fuel and chemical tanks that failed during Harvey. At least 14 tanks failed when their roofs sank under the weight of Harvey's unprecedented rainfall. Others were swept away by floodwaters.Including the Magellan spill, the accidents combined have released more than 600,000 gallons of fuel.Heine said what happened with Magellan's tanks was "related to flooding associated with the hurricane," but did not elaborate.Government regulations do not require tank owners to take specific steps to make the tanks flood resistant, although researchers have warned for years that they are prone to break open during severe hurricanes such as Hurricane Katrina, which caused several major storage tank spills.

The ground around the tanks is also saturated in dangerous fluids, severely restricting access to the facility 20 miles (32 kilometers) east of downtown Houston. On Friday, the company said they may be able to allow some access early this week.ITC and its top executive, Bernt Netland, have been chastised by elected officials for their handling of the unfolding disaster that cast a mile-high plume of black smoke over the fourth-largest American city for days, paralyzed its eastern suburbs and severed Houston’s waterborne access to the Gulf of Mexico. Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen’s probe of the event has so far been restricted to off-site interviews.“We haven’t been able to gain access to the site yet,” said Rachel Moreno, a spokeswoman for the fire marshal. “They’re still doing emergency operations and we need to wait until it’s safe for the investigators to go in.”Benzene eruptionsChristensen’s investigators won’t enter the site until the remaining tanks are emptied and other hazards have been mitigated, Moreno said. Clouds of cancer-causing benzene have continued to waft over the disaster site as well as nearby factories and suburbs, including one early Friday, according to ITC.Oil tankers and other ships headed for the manufacturing nexus along the Houston Ship Channel have been backing up in Galveston Bay and the Gulf because of runoff from ITC’s facility that polluted the waterway. The U.S. Coast Guard commander for the region said he doesn’t know when things may return to normal.Almost 20 miles of rubber barriers have been deployed to halt the spread of the oily sheen and protect oyster beds. Ferry service in the area remains shut down and the annual re-enactment of the 1836 Battle of San Jacinto that won Texas independence from Mexico has been canceled.ITC, a unit of Japanese conglomerate Mitsui & Co., may be facing billions of dollars in damages, penalties and clean-up costs. Every day the ship channel is closed erases $300 million from the local economy, Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia said. And that doesn’t take into account what ITC may owe the companies whose chemicals were burned and lost in the fire and subsequent spill.Owners notifiedBrent Weber, the senior vice president of sales and marketing who’s become the face of ITC’s response, declined to identify the owners of the chemicals, byproducts of the oil-refining process.“ITC is a storage terminal only so out of respect for our customers’ confidentiality we do not release that information, but, yes, the customers of that product have been notified and we’ve been in constant contact with all of our customers,” Weber said on Friday.Other entities investigating the incident include the U.S. Chemical Safety Board and the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued the company for violating air-pollution laws.Lawmakers may also take ITC leaders to task. State Senator Carol Alvarado wants the company hauled before the Select Committee on Texas Ports that she vice-chairs.“I’m sure that because of this incident, it’s causing people to pause and maybe rethink some of the infrastructure around” the region, Alvarado said. “Who would have thought that this fire would have caused this ripple effect that is impacting potentially the global market?”--With assistance from Rachel Adams-Heard, David Wethe, Ryan Collins and Ben Foldy.

KEVIN BEGOS | Associated PressIn at least four states that have nurtured the nation's energy boom, hundreds of complaints have been made about well-water contamination from oil or gas drilling.Pollution was confirmed in a number of them, according to a review that casts doubt on industry suggestions that such problems rarely happen.The Associated Press requested data on drilling-related complaints in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Texas and found major differences in how the states report such problems. Texas provided the most detail, while the other states provided only general outlines. And while the confirmed problems represent only a tiny portion of the thousands of oil and gas wells drilled each year in the U.S., the lack of detail in some state reports could help fuel public confusion and mistrust.The AP found that Pennsylvania received 398 complaints in 2013 alleging that oil or natural gas drilling polluted or otherwise affected private water wells, compared with 499 in 2012. The Pennsylvania complaints can include allegations of short-term diminished water flow, as well as pollution from stray gas or other substances. More than 100 cases of pollution were confirmed over the past five years.Just hearing the total number of complaints shocked Heather McMicken, an eastern Pennsylvania homeowner who complained about water-well contamination that state officials eventually confirmed."Wow, I'm very surprised," said McMicken, recalling that she and her husband never knew how many other people made similar complaints, since the main source of information "was just through the grapevine."The McMickens were one of three families that eventually reached a $1.6 million settlement with a drilling company. Heather McMicken said the state should be forthcoming with details.Over the past 10 years, hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has led to a boom in oil and natural gas production around the nation. It has reduced imports and led to hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for companies and landowners, but also created pollution fears.Extracting fuel from shale formations requires pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into the ground to break apart rock and free the gas. Some of that water, along with large quantities of existing underground water, returns to the surface, and it can contain high levels of salt, drilling chemicals, heavy metals and naturally occurring low-level radiation.But some conventional oil and gas wells are still drilled, so the complaints about water contamination can come from them, too. Experts say the most common type of pollution involves methane, not chemicals from the drilling process.Some people who rely on well water near drilling operations have complained about pollution, but there's been considerable confusion over how widespread such problems are. For example, starting in 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection aggressively fought efforts by the AP and other news organizations to obtain information about complaints related to drilling. The department has argued in court filings that it does not count how many contamination "determination letters" it issues or track where they are kept in its files.Steve Forde, a spokesman for the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the leading industry group in Pennsylvania, said in a statement that "transparency and making data available to the public is critical to getting this historic opportunity right and maintaining the public's trust."When the state Environmental Department determines natural gas development has caused problems, Forde said, "our member companies work collaboratively with the homeowner and regulators to find a speedy resolution."Among the findings in the AP's review:— Pennsylvania has confirmed at least 106 water-well contamination cases since 2005, out of more than 5,000 new wells. There were five confirmed cases of water-well contamination in the first nine months of 2012, 18 in all of 2011 and 29 in 2010. The Environmental Department said more complete data may be available in several months.— Ohio had 37 complaints in 2010 and no confirmed contamination of water supplies; 54 complaints in 2011 and two confirmed cases of contamination; 59 complaints in 2012 and two confirmed contaminations; and 40 complaints for the first 11 months of 2013, with two confirmed contaminations and 14 still under investigation, Department of Natural Resources spokesman Mark Bruce said in an email. None of the six confirmed cases of contamination was related to fracking, Bruce said.— West Virginia has had about 122 complaints that drilling contaminated water wells over the past four years, and in four cases the evidence was strong enough that the driller agreed to take corrective action, officials said.— A Texas spreadsheet contains more than 2,000 complaints, and 62 of those allege possible well-water contamination from oil and gas activity, said Ramona Nye, a spokeswoman for the Railroad Commission of Texas, which oversees drilling. Texas regulators haven't confirmed a single case of drilling-related water-well contamination in the past 10 years, she said.In Pennsylvania, the number of confirmed instances of water pollution in the eastern part of the state "dropped quite substantially" in 2013, compared with previous years, Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman Lisa Kasianowitz wrote in an email. Two instances of drilling affecting water wells were confirmed there last year, she said, and a final decision hasn't been made in three other cases. But she couldn't say how many of the other statewide complaints have been resolved or were found to be from natural causes.Releasing comprehensive information about gas drilling problems is important because the debate is no longer about just science but trust, said Irina Feygina, a social psychologist who studies environmental policy issues. Losing public trust is "a surefire way to harm" the reputation of any business, Feygina said.Experts and regulators agree that investigating complaints of water-well contamination is particularly difficult, in part because some regions also have natural methane gas pollution or other problems unrelated to drilling. A 2011 Penn State study found that about 40 percent of water wells tested prior to gas drilling failed at least one federal drinking water standard. Pennsylvania is one of only a few states that don't have private water-well construction standards.But other experts say people who are trying to understand the benefits and harms from the drilling boom need comprehensive details about complaints, even if some cases are from natural causes.In Pennsylvania, the raw number of complaints "doesn't tell you anything," said Rob Jackson, a Duke University scientist who has studied gas drilling and water contamination issues. Jackson said he doesn't think providing more details is asking for too much."Right or wrong, many people in the public feel like DEP is stonewalling some of these investigations," Jackson said of the situation in Pennsylvania.In contrast with the limited information provided by Pennsylvania, Texas officials supplied a detailed 94-page spreadsheet almost immediately, listing all types of oil and gas related complaints over much of the past two years. The Texas data include the date of the complaint, the landowner, the drilling company and a brief summary of the alleged problems. Many complaints involve other issues, such as odors or abandoned equipment.Scott Anderson, an expert on oil and gas drilling with the Environmental Defense Fund, a national nonprofit based in Austin, notes that Texas regulators started keeping more data on complaints in the 1980s. New legislation in 2011 and 2013 led to more detailed reports and provided funds for a new information technology system, he said.Anderson agreed that a lack of transparency fuels mistrust."If the industry has nothing to hide, then they should be willing to let the facts speaks for themselves," he said. "The same goes for regulatory agencies."

By Jennifer Hiller, Staff WriterValero Energy Corp.'s Corpus Christi West refinery.Valero Energy Corp.'s Corpus Christi West refinery.CaptionCloseValero Energy Corp.'s Corpus Christi West refinery.Valero Energy Corp.'s Corpus Christi West refinery.A Corpus Christi attorney filed a lawsuit Thursday against Valero Energy Corp.’s refinery there less than 24 hours after the city issued a warning to its 320,000 residents telling them not to drink or shower with the water because it may have been contaminated in an industrial “back-flow incident.”The suit was filed in Nueces County on behalf of local businesses, including Anthony’s Aveda Concept Salon, which had to close because of the lack of water. The plaintiffs are seeking more than $1 million in damages.“This case demonstrates the human and societal suffering caused when the drive for corporate profits takes priority over the safety of ordinary people,” attorney Bob Hilliard, who filed the case, said in a statement. He’s also suing Valero Marketing and Supply Co., Valero South Texas Marketing Co., the Valero Bill Greehey Plant in Corpus Christi and Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions Inc.Valero spokeswoman Lillian Riojas said the company doesn’t believe that its refineries in Corpus Christi caused the problem or that the local water supply was actually contaminated. The company hasn’t responded to questions about the incident, but issued this statement:“At this time, we believe this is a localized backflow issue from third party operations in the area of Valero’s asphalt terminal … We believe this issue is isolated to a lateral industrial line. Valero is offering its resources to assist the city in isolating the issue and to help confirm this has not impacted the city’s water supply.”The Corpus Christi legislative delegation released a statement saying two chemicals may have been released into the public water system, according to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times.The city previously identified Indulin AA-86, an emulsifying agent for asphalt, as the main hazard. It’s an amber liquid considered hazardous by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and can cause eye and skin burns and severe respiratory tract irritation, according to the chemical Material Safety Data Sheet.Valero Energy, the nation’s largest refiner, has two plants at its Bill Greehey refineries complex in Corpus Christi. The plants have a combined capacity of 325,000 barrels per day and are located along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel. The city’s industrial district is located north of Interstate 37 near downtown and along Nueces Bay.The Port of Corpus Christi said it was complying with the notice to discontinue the use of tap water and is in touch with customers, but has other water sources available.“Port Corpus Christi continues to notify customers who may be using the Port facilities of the ban and will continue to keep customers aware and updated on the situation as we know more,” the port said in a statement Thursday afternoon. “Port Corpus Christi has water supply from other sources including San Patricio Water District which is not affected by the ban. Port Corpus Christi will continue its diligence on keeping customers current on the situation and supporting maritime operations as needed.”A spokesman with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which regulates the industry, said the agency expects to issue a statement about Corpus Christi. jhiller@express-news.net Twitter: @Jennifer_Hiller jhiller@express-news.netTwitter: @Jennifer_Hiller

By Ryan Handy, Houston ChronicleThe Railroad Commission of Texas fined an oil and gas wastewater management company for disposing of contaminated water without a permit, and releasing toxic chemicals in fresh water on a piece of property in West Texas.The company, Clean Tech Waste Solutions, based in Austin, was fined more than $5,000 on Tuesday for multiple violations spanning several months, commission documents show. But Commissioner Ryan Sitton argued that fine wasn’t enough for a company that repeatedly broke state rules regarding water protection. The Railroad Commission issues permits for the disposal of wastewater from oil and gas production, which can be injected deep underground or put into surface containment ponds.The company could not immediately be reached for comment.Inspectors for the commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry, visited Clean Tech’s facility in Big Lake, south of Midland, eight times between February 2015 and August 2016 and reported contaminated soil and no efforts to clean it up. Some inspections found that rainfall had caused a frac tank — which holds water and chemical mixture used in hydraulic fracturing — to overflow and contaminate the surrounding area.In a report, the staff asked the commission’s to fine the company because “discharges of oil and gas wastes can contaminate the land surface, affect the health of humans and animals, and may eventually be discharged to surface or subsurface waters, causing pollution.

By Mella McEwen, MRT.com/Midland Reporter-TelegramCaptionCloseThe Permian Basin continues to dominate the state – and the nation – in energy production. But a new report says the area also continues to dominate in illegal air pollution, according to 2017 figures."Major Malfunction," issued by the Environment Texas Research and Policy Center, found Midland-area industrial facilities reported releasing 37 million pounds of pollution into the air without authorization. Statewide, facilities reported releasing more than 63 million pounds without authorization, a 27 percent increase over the previous year."This is the third year we've gotten this analysis (so) we're not surprised about the continued violations," Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, said in a phone interview. He said the continued increase in emissions in the Midland-Odessa is concerning and that the group had hoped for a decline.OIL REPORT: One-day conference to examine parent-child well dynamicsThe report criticized the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for what it called a lack of enforcement action, noting that over the last seven years, the total number of enforcement orders filed by the agency is less than 3 percent of the total number of emissions events it recorded during that time.Brian McGovern, media relations specialist with the TCEQ, told the Reporter-Telegram via email that the commission "does not comment on the reports of other groups. However, we vigorously defend our enforcement process.""They defend their process but the numbers speak for themselves," Metzger said. "These are self-reported violations. They're emphasizing the carrot approach rather than the stick approach. If the carrot approach were working, we'd see declines in emissions."Ben Shepperd, president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, said via email, "In a cursory review of the report, it's clear that the goal of this report is to point merely at emissions that occurred more than a year ago, largely in routine maintenance, in order to criticize the ongoing efforts of energy industry companies to safely and responsibly develop natural resources."The Permian Basin has produced untold prosperity for the region and the state," he said. "This report only focuses on a small portion of the challenges that the industry faces. Frankly, if organizations would follow our lead in supporting the financial needs of the state agencies involved in these regulatory functions, we'd see these reports in a more genuine light."Shepperd also came to the defense of the TCEQ."However, it is always easy to criticize those on the frontlines. While these critics will continue to sound alarms in skewed reports, the Permian Basin will continue to provide prosperity for the region and the state and the Permian Basin Petroleum Association will continue to proudly represent these good actors in creating a more prosperous America and Texas," he said in the email.OIL REPORT: Proposed Winkler County refinery could benefit local drivers' pocketbooksTopping the report's list of worst polluters in the Midland-Odessa area was the Waha Header Compressor Station on the Trans-Pecos Pipeline in Pecos County.In a statement emailed to the Reporter-Telegram, Energy Partners said the emissions event was "the result of an isolated event due to scheduled work that occurred on the pipeline back in 2017. This is not something that will be reoccurring. Our environmental policy is to have as few emission events as possible through a focused effort on operational performance. We are also committed to habitat conservation, land restoration and minimizing our footprint where possible."The report cites some complaints filed with TCEQ, including one filed June 16, 2017 that alleged emissions from the James Lake Gas Plant in Ector County and Seminole Gas Processing Plant in Gaines County were impacting children at a summer camp. The Seminole Gas Processing Plant reported a release of more than 1.19 million pounds of sulfur dioxide on June 15-21, while James Lake Gas Plant released 21,249 pounds of sulfur dioxide during an event that on June 12-15."Occidental Petroleum took over operatorship of the Seminole Plant in September 2017, and is actively investing in programs to control, monitor and minimize emissions from that plant as we do for all of our operated assets," Clint Williamson, manager of communications and public affairs, told the Reporter-Telegram by email.RELATED: Water In Energy conference gears up for second year"Occidental Petroleum is committed to conducting its business in a manner that protects the health and safety of people and the environment at its facilities and in the communities where we operate," he said. "We are continuously seeking improvement in resource recovery, conservation, pollution prevention, energy efficiency, including ongoing efforts to manage and capture methane and other greenhouse gas emissions."Also cited as a top polluter was Anadarko Petroleum's Silvertip 76 17 Unit P 1H in Loving County.John Christiansen, vice president, corporate communications with Anadarko, said, "Reducing emissions is a key focus for all of our U.S. onshore activities. In the Delaware Basin of West Texas specifically, we are utilizing a tankless development approach that greatly reduces emissions from our operations."We also use Forward-looking infrared camera technology to detect and address leaks and have expanded our infrastructure to largely eliminate the need for venting or flaring," Christiansen said via email. "The emissions cited in the report are related to a well-control event that occurred in 2017. We reported both the event and associated emissions to the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality respectively, with the Railroad Commission overseeing the cleanup that was completed in 2017."Chevron's Mabee Ranch CO2 Plant in Andrews County and J.T. McElroy 202 TB in Crane County were also cited in Environment Texas' report.In a statement emailed to the Reporter-Telegram, the company said, "We have seen the Environment Texas Research & Policy Center report and are in the process of reviewing their data and methodology. Chevron reports emissions events as required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. In February 2017, we experienced an event at the Mabee C02 Plant, which accounted for over 80 percent of the facility's emissions referenced in the report. In 2018, we made significant investments in the McElroy field and Mabee C02 Plant to decrease emissions and improve reliability. Chevron supports efforts to reduce emissions and continues to invest in our operations to improve environmental performance."Metzger called on the Texas Legislature to eliminate a loophole known as "affirmative defense" that he said allows polluters to escape penalties. He said that the Environmental Protection Agency had told TCEQ to eliminate the loophole, but the agency refused. The issue is now in court."This should be a bipartisan consensus issue," said Metzger. "Everyone believes you should follow the law. We're talking about companies exceeding already-generous permits."When companies take the issue seriously and follow the law, emissions decline, he said.Many of the emissions events cited in the report are preventable and avoidable, he said, citing memos from the EPA dating back to the 1980s that say the incidents are preventable and avoidable.Inaction is costing the Texas economy, and also is leading to about $150 million in health care costs to treat asthma, heart attacks and cancer, among other ailments, he said.And because "we haven't gotten the enforcement we need from the EPA or the state, we're going to enforce our rights by going to court until we get vigorous enforcement," Metzger said.

By Ashley McBrideCaptionCloseAs winds push smoke from the Camp Fire to the south, air quality in the Bay Area is expected to worsen Monday.Ryan Walbrun, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service for the Bay Area, said he expects smoke concentration levels in the air to be high in those areas through at least Monday.The forecast depends on the behavior of the Camp Fire — high winds peaking in Butte County on Sunday could cause the blaze to spread to the south.“A lot of the active heat is south of Paradise now,” Walbrun said. “It’s moving in the direction toward Oroville but still well outside of it at this time.”Low visibility caused by the smoke led to flight delays Sunday at San Francisco International Airport, said Chris Morgan, an airport spokesman.The FAA implemented two Ground Delay Programs, which limit the number of arrivals an airport can accept in a given time. The first started at 9 a.m. and ended at 3 p.m., and another ran from 6:30 p.m. until midnight. Two cancellations were reported by Sunday evening, plus 202 delays, averaging about 35 minutes, said Airport Duty Manager Maria Buyco. She added that it’s unclear whether all were caused by the ground delay program.The local air quality index of 156 is unhealthy and can exacerbate conditions for those with heart and lung diseases. Officials at the Bay Area Air Quality Management District recommend residents stay inside, keep windows and doors closed, and avoid exercising outside.A winter Spare the Air alert is also in effect, banning residents from burning wood indoors or outdoors.Even short-term exposure to fine particles can cause persistent cough, runny nose, phlegm and wheezing, according to the California Department of Public Health. The department warns that surgical masks, dust masks, bandannas or other face coverings do not offer protection from particle pollution. For adults, N95 or P100 masks are recommended.Ashley McBride is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: ashley.mcbride@sfchronicle.comTwitter: @ashleynmcb

A fire tore through the area on the evening of Oct. 8, destroying properties and vineyards.Air quality in the Bay Area will be in the “red” unhealthy zone Wednesday for the sixth consecutive day because of smoke from the deadly Camp Fire in Butte County.Residents who are outside for long periods of time can wear N95 respiratory masks to filter out harmful particles from the smoke that damage lungs, but officials at the Bay Area Air Quality Management District recommend people stay indoors to avoid inhaling the hazy, smoke-filled air.The air indoors, however, is only better if people keep windows and doors closed to block the smoky air from coming inside, air quality agency spokeswoman Sarah Zahedi said.“You’re more exposed when you’re outside than when you’re inside,” she said. “We encourage people to purchase a HEPA air filter and create at least one clean air room in your house.”Parts of the Bay Area could see shifts and differing levels of air quality, with some counties experiencing unhealthy air and others with moderate air.“Since wildfire smoke is unpredictable, conditions can change and fluctuate quickly,” Zahedi said. “While it may be moderate for one period, it can quickly shift.”She added that light winds are keeping the smoke hovering over the region. Residents should expect unhealthy air quality through at least Friday, when the forecast on smoke becomes more ambiguous.In Sonoma County, Gravenstein Union and River Montessori schools closed because of the air. San Francisco Unified School District schools remained open, but officials said they would be monitoring smoke levels in order to take the necessary precautions, like canceling sports practices and games. A red alert was issued for the city Wednesday morning.A Spare-the-Air advisory is in effect through at least Friday, prohibiting residents from burning wood, which could worsen the air quality, authorities said.The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management published a map of filtered air facilities in the city, where residents can go to get a reprieve from the smoke. The list includes public libraries and Westfield San Francisco Centre. Ashley McBride is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: ashley.mcbride@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @ashleynmcb

In Oakland, the reading was nearly as bad as San Francisco's at 256."These are the highest levels we've had in the Bay Area ever since I've been here," says Richard Muller, a physics professor at UC Berkeley who co-founded the Berkeley Earth site tracking air quality around the world.In recent days Northern California has felt as if it is under siege as the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history continues to rage near Chico and pump noxious smoke into the air.The acrid smoke from the Camp Fire irritates the lungs and stings the eyes, and Northern California residents from Butte County to the Bay Area are staying inside, huddled next to air filters, to limit smoke exposure. Many school districts canceled class Friday and San Francisco Airport has reported delays due to limited visibility all week.ALSO: Forecast keeps changing, but one thing looking increasingly likely: Rain in Butte County next week On Thursday, the index that measures the public health impacts of pollution, peaked in San Francisco at 245, breaking the record-hitting hourly readings the city saw in October 2017 when the North Bay wildfires were burning. The Sacramento Valley, Chico area and Livermore have also seen "hazardous" levels in recent days.The current weather pattern with a light offshore breeze from the Sacramento Valley blowing directly into the Bay Area is a perfect recipe for delivering smoke into the region. The smoke is pouring into the San Francisco area and it's moving slowly enough that it can't make its way over coastal mountains. The only way out is the Golden Gate and that's a narrow opening.What's more, S.F.'s natural air-conditioner — the ocean breeze — has been turned off with a high-pressure system over the area and blocking Pacific systems. San Franciscans are used to breathing that fresh ocean air but this week they've received little of it.MORE: No relief: Dire Bay Area air conditions now forecast through TuesdayThe San Francisco Bay Area can't expect significant relief from the wildfire smoke-choked air until next week. The current weather pattern is going to hold through Tuesday, and on Wednesday a storm in the forecast is expected to finally bring relief from the noxious air."There will be a change in wind direction, and that clean marine air coming in from the Pacific," says Spencer Tangen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Monterey office. " That onshore wind will be stronger, and it'll help to mix out the smoke, and push the smoke out."There's also a 30 to 40 percent chance of rain on Wednesday, and Tangen says, "The rain will actually remove some of the smoke itself." Rain also returns to the forecast on Thursday, with a 40 to 50 percent chance.

By Nancy AldermanThe Connecticut Council on Environmental Quality Annual Report, released April 17, showed that we all breathed unhealthy air for 31 days last year. We knew that last summer had 30 days of temperature 90 degrees or higher — but now we also know that we had even more days than that of bad air. Our air was heavily polluted with ground-level ozone.Ground-level ozone is created when car exhaust is mixed with sunlight, which is why ozone levels are higher in the summer months.However, the majority of Connecticut’s ozone pollution comes not from our automobiles but from the coal-fired power plants of Ohio, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, where their emissions flow eastward into Connecticut.Connecticut is taking a proactive stance on this issue by petitioning the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to require dirty midwestern power plants to clean up their emissions. The Connecticut petition is being joined by Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Pennsylvania.What are the health effects of ozone and why is it important to reduce our exposures?Ozone, even small amounts, affects our lungs and our breathing.Ozone can cause the muscles in airways to constrict, trapping air and leading to wheezing and shortness of breath. Ozone can cause coughing and sore throats, it can make lungs more susceptible to infection, inflame and damage  airways, increase the frequency of asthma attacks, aggravate emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma and cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.Long-term exposure to ozone is likely to be one of the many causes of asthma. Long-term exposures to higher concentrations of ozone may be linked to permanent lung damage and abnormal lung development in children.A New York University Study, published May 8, 2016, in the American Thoracic Society and Marron Institute Report, estimated 168 people die every year in Connecticut from bad air and about 472 people have a major health event due to air pollution, according to the report.The 31 days that Connecticut’s air was laden with ground-level ozone is a serious problem for our health. What can be done to help Connecticut’s citizens on these bad air days?1. Attorney General George Jepsen is doing his part by petitioning the EPA to clean up the midwestern power plants and to threaten to bring the EPA to court if they do not comply.2. On bad air days, when it is hard to breathe, the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection could declare no wood-burning. Wood smoke also causes breathing problems because it contains chemical-laden particulates that also go deep into the lungs.The largest single source of outdoor fine particles in many American cities is from wood smoke. Wood smoke and tobacco smoke are quite similar in their chemical composition. According to the EPA many components of wood smoke are carcinogenic and have many of the same components as cigarette smoke. The particles of wood smoke are so small they can penetrate into the deepest recesses of the lungs. These particles become efficient vehicles for transporting toxins into the lungs where they pass directly into the bloodstream.Both ground level ozone and wood smoke are detrimental to lung function and both have serious health implications. The combination of being exposed to two serious lung damaging agents at the same time is a recipe for creating serious human health impacts. Adding wood smoke emissions to ozone-laden air is a lethal combination that is enough to send many to emergency rooms.Environment and Human Health Inc. commends the CEQ on its informative report. EHHI also commends the Connecticut attorney general for working to curb pollution that comes into Connecticut from midwestern power plants, and EHHI continues to ask the Connecticut DEEP to restrict wood burning on “bad air days” for the sake of all of us and our health.“No other New England state had more than 11 days with unhealthful levels of ozone,” the Council On Environmental Quality reports says.Connecticut had 31 days.Nancy Alderman is president of Environment and Human Health Inc.

Tribune News ServicesBy BRIAN GILMOREGuest Columnist(TNS) There is something terribly disturbing about the contaminated water crisis in Flint.When state leaders can’t even deliver basic services such as safe drinking water, they have failed.The background to the tragic situation is an austerity politics that seeks to cut back basic government services in the name of cost-cutting.The city of Flint switched its water source from Lake Huron (which is where Detroit gets its water) to the Flint River in April 2014.It was a move designed to save a very economically depressed city some money. It was the wrong move.An emergency manager appointed by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder signed off on the decision. Rather than putting the interests of citizens first, the unelected, all-powerful emergency manager was charged with making hard-headed “business” decisions.That approach — in Flint and elsewhere around the country — has had disastrous results.Right away, children and residents got sick from drinking the water, even though the city managers assured them it was safe.By August, the water tested positive for E. coli and by September 2014, citizens had been advised to boil their water before drinking it by local officials.In January 2015, residents were lining up daily to get free bottled water and the city was found to be in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.The number of children testing positive for elevated levels of lead had skyrocketed since the switch from Lake Huron.By April 2015 city officials were demanding that the water source be changed back but had no power to make it happen. State officials, led by Snyder, dragged their feet and did not take the unfolding disaster seriously.It got worse.By July 2015, the governor’s office still did nothing substantial to deliver safe drinking water to the citizens in the city. Children continued to suffer.It was only just recently, after months of delay and failed leadership, and calls from citizens for the arrest and indictment of Snyder, that the Snyder administration finally declared a state of emergency.The state now is providing access to clean water to the citizens of Flint. Snyder apologized twice to the city for his mistakes.Yet doctors say it will take years to determine the extent of damage to children in the city due to exposure to lead. The children who sustained brain damage will never recover.The water crisis in Flint did not have to happen.Yet politicians around the country are similarly putting cost-cutting ahead of the health of thousands of citizens in their states by refusing to accept the federal funds to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.This is no way to serve the people. The people of Flint and others deserve a government responsive to their basic needs, not one beholden to an anti-democratic ideology.Brian Gilmore wrote this for Progressive Media Project, a source of liberal commentary on domestic and international issues; it is affiliated with The Progressive magazine.

By Noi MahoneyEastside residents continue to find trash such as old mattresses dumped illegally on Badger Street in District 2.Eastside residents continue to find trash such as old mattresses dumped illegally on Badger Street in District 2.CaptionCloseEastside residents continue to find trash such as old mattresses dumped illegally on Badger Street in District 2.Eastside residents continue to find trash such as old mattresses dumped illegally on Badger Street in District 2.Some Eastside residents are getting fed up with people illegally dumping trash in their neighborhoods and say they want to do something about it.Wray Hood, president of the Coliseum/Willow Park Neighborhood Association in District 2, said the problem has been piling up for months, and the group wants it stopped.“It just makes you sick to have to drive by and see all that garbage on your streets,” Hood said. “You recognize it as uncaring people.”The neighborhood of Coliseum/Willow Park — with boundaries of East Commerce Street to the north, Spriggsdale Boulevard to the west, Martin Luther King Boulevard to the south and Salado Creek to the east — sits in the shadows of the AT&T Center and Freeman Coliseum.Hood said that two areas where people continually dump junk are Badger Street and Aransas Street near the Interstate 10 overpass.“It's just terrible dumping,” she said. “Everything a person can dump there, they will.”Shirley Davis, another member of the neighborhood group, added Badger Street has been a constant source of problems for the area.“It's awful, all kinds of things end up there, old mattresses, furniture, just junk,” Davis said. “It's really weird. The city comes out and cleans it up, and people come back and dump again.”The Coliseum/Willow Park Neighborhood Association will be holding a rally against illegal dumping at 9 a.m. this morning at the corner of Aransas and Lone Oak streets.“(We'll) make an issue out of it, and maybe that will help us,” Hood said.Davis said she has actually observed people dumping — or about to dump — junk illegally on the streets, but she is afraid to confront them. “Maybe, if it's possible, we could add cameras to see them and get their license plate numbers,” Davis said.District 2 City Councilwoman Ivy R. Taylor could not be reached for comment.Southside resident George Garcia said illegal dumping continues to be a problem “all over the city.” Dumping sites around the South Side have included areas off Southton Road and Loop 410; and others off of Villamain Road.Last year, Garcia led a push to clean up Southtown and Villamain streets in District 3.“Villamain continues to be a problem because certain individuals don't have any respect or values and discard their trash on city streets and private properties,” Garcia said. “We need to teach our future generation about protecting our environment. We cannot continue to pollute our creeks and rivers.”Garcia said District 3 Councilwoman Leticia Ozuna and her staff have been helpful in the fight against illegal dumping.“We continue to report illegal dumping and are hoping that the message is received that we will not let a certain few impose their will on those of us that are trying to protect the environment,” Garcia said. nmahoney@primetimenewspapers.com
